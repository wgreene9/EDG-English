Wallachia today has long been silent, unable to find a powerful symbol to lead us. With the reconstruction of the Order of the Dragon, Wallachia's national identity also requires a new emblem to shape it.

The atrocities, stake by stake, delivered a tremendous visual impact upon the cowardly survivors. Desperate people knelt at the Voivode's feet, pleading for mercy. Though they were but mantises trying to stop a chariot, they could still become obstacles to the Voivode's cause of spreading terror and despair.\n\nUnder the devastating blow of impalement, we face two choices: to 'gloriously' allow the remaining cowards to embrace the Voivode, becoming 'compatriots' of the Voivode's homeland and sharing the honor of serving him as his people do, or to demote them to inferior subjects, making them objects of enslavement?"

Our intervention is morally and legally justified, but only to the extent of helping the claimant nobles regain their rightful throne.\n\nHowever, if we refuse—and that too is reasonable—they will still enjoy the treatment befitting nobles on this land, while our iron hoofs will trample the plains of Ruthenia.\n\nYet would this not then seem unjust?

EDG_WALEvents.10.name:0 "The Revolt of Valancata"
EDG_WALEvents.10.desc:0 "The town of Valancata is a prosperous settlement below the city of Giurgiu. Thanks to its extensive network of transportation routes, commerce flows frequently here, with merchants and travelers coming and going constantly. Consequently, the peasants of Valancata live in abundance, and urban life thrives.\n\nAlthough Wallachia's political climate is not particularly friendly, it has never interfered with Valancata's development.\n\nThis signifies that in the past, while Wallachia itself may have been unstable, its people lived richly and well—a classic case of a poor state but wealthy citizens. However, everything changed with the ascension of Vlad Tepeș. Vlad built the infamous Castle Dracula, treating his subjects like enslaved livestock. Together with some like-minded nobles, he frequently confiscated the people's hard-earned wealth to fill his own coffers.\n\nAt first, a few plotted to assassinate this Voivode and return to normal life, but Dracula seemed like an immortal demon—assassination attempts repeatedly failed. Heavy corvée labor and taxes, coupled with endless terrifying rumors, finally drove the people to formally stand up against the Voivode's rule.\n\nValancata became the bastion of the townsfolk and peasants, the first place to rally those not yet numbed by enslavement. The revolt in Valancata spread like wildfire, igniting across all of Wallachia.\n\nVoivode Dracula's only response was a cold, cruel smile in the flickering candlelight of his grim castle."

Dracula's cruel, twisted smile chills those who see it.\n\nAnd Dracula uses his own will to show them that he will exterminate the rebels, slaughtering them with extraordinarily perverse and cold-blooded methods, until not a shred of resistance remains in their hearts, until the shadow never dissipates from the rebels' minds, leaving only silent tears to soak the earth."

EDG_WALEvents.14.desc:0 "The rebel army and Dracula's forces clashed head-on no fewer than a dozen times.\n\nUnexpectedly, the rebels swiftly defeated Dracula's army—yet this seemed almost inevitable, for Dracula's troops were utterly devoid of fighting spirit. They did not know for what they fought; instead, from beginning to end, they believed they were abetting a tyrant.\n\n'Cor, do you truly believe what you are doing is right? Is this laughable loyalty your reason for taking up arms against your own kin and family?'\n\n'Balev, think of all we have suffered—living without dignity, trampled upon, and after death, our corpses hung on stakes to rot and fester, devoured by vultures. Is this the nation you wish to defend?'\n\nSuch piercing words turned the loyalty of Dracula's army, and for a time, the rule of Voivode Dracula seemed precarious.\n\nHowever, a suffocating scene unfolded during the defense of the royal capital. As the rebel army inexorably surrounded the city, Dracula—the man emerging from the shadows—stood atop the battlements, his crimson eyes fixed lethally upon the rebels below as if they were but clay chickens and straw dogs.\n\nThe rebels' fervor had no effect on him. That day, only a sky thick with black clouds remained.\n\nWhen the clouds dispersed and sunlight returned to the earth, the rebel army had vanished, without even a trace left behind, as if they had never existed. The Voivode merely brushed his sleeves and returned to his 'loyal' realm with a twisted smile.\n\nNo one knows what happened. The surviving commoners within the capital dared not inquire. They only know this: the Voivode is terrifying, so terrifying that it steals one's very voice!"

EDG_WALEvents.15.desc:0 "With the conclusion of the royal capital's defense, everyone became deeply reticent about the outcome, while Dracula sat within his castle, enjoying the 'peace.'\n\nWithin the capital, whispers from the countryside claimed that on that day, Voivode Dracula stood upon the battlements, then grew immense black wings from his back. His lower body turned into mist, while his upper torso retained human form, his face wearing a fierce expression and a depraved, twisted smile. Wherever he passed, people dissolved into bloody mist that coalesced and flowed into the Voivode's body, while weapons dissipated into black fog.\n\nMany also claimed that headless knights driving phantom carriages entered and exited Castle Dracula daily, said to be harvesting the souls and essence of the Voivode's slaughtered enemies to bring into the castle for the Voivode to savor day and night.\n\nThis notion was not without basis, for the Voivode seemed never to appoint a steward. His castle was guarded only by sparse sentries, and he appeared never to procure food fit for human consumption. On the contrary, those who truly ventured deep into Castle Dracula never returned.\n\nThe terrifying, fantastical legends of the Voivode coalesced into a rumor. People felt that 'demon' was no longer apt for this dreadful ruler, preferring instead to call him a 'Vampire.'\n\nThe Voivode's response to these rumors was ambiguous. He never confirmed them, but neither did he deny them."

Amid mountains of bones and astronomical numbers of the disappeared, the rebellion collapsed of its own accord.\n\nAt least for now, none dare challenge the Voivode's authority. At least for now, none dare show their faces to voice dissent against the Voivode.\n\nThe wailing souls upon countless stakes, the feasts baptized in blood—each moment reminds all of the Voivode's terror.\n\nWhen those unfortunate enough to tread upon this horrific land arrive, they see streets deathly silent, countless people shuffling forward numbly. None know where their future leads; they can only blindly obey the commands of the Voivode's bailiffs.\n\nEven officials, nobles, and clergy shudder. The walls are periodically hung with mutilated corpses; even passing through the gates, one might feel blackened blood drip from above onto their face.\n\nThis nation no longer welcomes outsiders. Humans are but breeding tools for the expansion of the Voivode's ambitions. Apart from engaging in ceaseless, drug-induced debauchery under the Voivode's rule to fulfill carnal desires, there remains only numb submission to death.\n\nTerror, sorrow, despair—these seem to perpetually hover over this land, never to dissipate."

It seemed no one in the East could withstand Wallachia's overwhelming onslaught. For a time, countless souls prayed for the coming of a savior.\n\nThey hoped that Jesus would send a Theo-dotes (God's appointed representative) to help them escape this mire of mud and despair, to free them from a land eternally shrouded in terror.\n\nIf no one could aid them, then the people of Wallachia could only sink deeper into depravity. Perhaps the entire world would be dragged into hell by Voivode Dracula, forced to submit to his eternal reign.\n\nAnd then came the light of the Catholic faith. A battle-hardened, illustrious monster hunter stepped forth. He vowed to end Dracula's rule, to turn the tide and set Wallachia upon the 'righteous path.' For this, countless are willing to follow in his footsteps.\n\n'Van Helsing Konstantin... intriguing.' This was the Voivode Dracula's sole response to this grandly proclaimed crusade."

Dracula once again found himself condemned by all.\n\nThis time, Dracula was deserted by all once more, yet the Voivode remained seated calmly within his castle. It seemed he still believed no one could threaten his 'divine' rule.\n\nHis reign, like his life, was eternal."

For the first time, his steps seemed somewhat hurried, as if the intensity of this resistance had wearied even the ever-confident Dracula.\n\nWhat further ignited Dracula's wrath was that Van Helsing Konstantin was no mere saint in name, but a true powerhouse possessing the strength to defeat him.\n\nDracula grew weary from fending off Van Helsing's assaults. His aura of invincibility seemed to be slowly shattering, while Van Helsing, also battered and wounded, engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Dracula.\n\nThis protracted conflict was nearing its conclusion, and in the days to come, the followers of both sides would determine whether to sing hymns of praise or a march of despair."

Van Helsing's silver arrows sliced through the air time and again, yet failed to strike Dracula.\n\nDracula, too, felt a genuine, overwhelming strain against this man of terrifying agility. The holy relics upon Van Helsing repelled the encroaching darkness Dracula cast, while the hunter's arrow in his hand hung over Dracula's head like Death's scythe.\n\nTheir struggle within Castle Dracula lasted a full night. By the time dawn arrived, both the hunters and Voivode Dracula were utterly exhausted.\n\nBoth Voivode Dracula and Van Helsing keenly realized this was the final clash. Justice and evil, darkness and light, would determine victory in the moment dawn broke.\n\nDracula swiftly lunged. Too weak to assail the relic-protected Van Helsing, he turned his gaze to a more vulnerable target: Mina, Van Helsing's beloved. Seizing her, he took her hostage. Van Helsing had but one silver arrow remaining. Facing the risk of harming his beloved, he hesitated—a rare moment, for he still retained humanity's greatest trait: love.\n\nNow, the two exchanged taunts, yet with unspoken understanding, they launched their fatal strikes at each other.\n\nThis silver arrow, piercing the dawn, seemed exceptionally heavy, slow, and yet... swift as lightning!"
