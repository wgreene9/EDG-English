EDG_Mission_PER_1_11_title:0 "The Iranian Renaissance"
EDG_Mission_PER_1_11_desc:0 "Ismail's reinstatement of the Iranian scribes stemmed from two considerations: firstly, these Iranian civil officials were more familiar with the internal administrative operations of Iran compared to the Qizilbash Emirs; secondly, the scribes possessed no military forces of their own, posing no substantial threat to Ismail's rule and thus being easier to control. Subsequently, with the support of the Shahanshah, the Iranian scribes gradually evolved into a political force capable of rivaling the Qizilbash. Due to their respective characteristics, they came to be known as the 'men of the pen' and the 'men of the sword.' The resurgence of the Persian bureaucracy provided the institutional conditions for the Iranian Renaissance."

EDG_Mission_PER_1_13_title:0 "Reforming the Harem"
EDG_Mission_PER_1_13_desc:0 "The Iranian harem system, over the long term, became a shackle for imperial heirs, known as the 'cage system.' Within the Iranian harem, princes had almost no opportunity to participate in politics, spending their days immersed in wine and women. This could only produce a generation of weak and incompetent successors, gradually diminishing the authority of the Iranian monarchy. Meanwhile, in an imperial court already rife with factions, the succession to the throne was itself a major affair often mired in obscurity. Since the princes' mothers could inherit their husbands' estates and control a group of eunuchs and slaves, they wielded considerable political influence and could even participate in the princes' competition for the throne, further amplifying the crisis of the imperial succession system. It is clear that the Iranian harem system must be reformed. Although our western Ottoman regime also has some issues with its harem system, we can still emulate them and learn from their experiences."

EDG_Mission_PER_1_14_desc:0 "The power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is constrained by the state's council and the Grand Vizier. If the Grand Vizier raises an objection, even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can accomplish nothing.\nWhile this form of government benefits various social strata, it is not ideal for a [Root.GovernmentName] that seeks to concentrate great authority in the hands of the ruler. We must ensure that figures from those strata are also restrained, just like the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nAbbas bestowed upon his new Grand Vizier an honorary title—Etemad ud-Daula ('Pillar of the State')—and Hatam proved to be an exceptionally capable administrator. He remained in office for nearly twenty years, during which he established a highly effective governmental bureaucracy. Iskandar, who served under him, remarked that he 'brought a sense of security to the lives of the Iranian people' and that 'in judicial administration, financial affairs, and organizing assemblies, he was a model for all.' He was also admired by foreigners; Father Paul Simon, a Carmelite friar who was sent to Iran, reported to Rome his astonishment at how easily Hatam Beg completed a heavy workload. The friar described how Hatam Beg 'was accustomed to signing and dispatching two hundred documents in a single morning, then after sitting through six to seven hours of administrative council meetings, he would emerge as calmly as if he had just returned from a horseback stroll.' Beyond serving as Grand Vizier, Hatam Beg also became a military commander in the further pacification of the country. He managed to do so without incurring the wrath of the Qizilbash, unlike his predecessor Mirza Salman—a symbol of the changing times."

EDG_Mission_PER_1_18_desc:0 "Our nation has learned one truth from countless campaigns: the rules of war must evolve with the times. Our ancestors carried swords and bows, conquering far and wide on horseback. The advent of gunpowder redefined how we annihilate enemy forces. Although blades, bows, and horses remain the primary arms of our military, it is evident that a new technology of war is rising. Our neighboring states have already begun adopting new weapons such as muskets to subjugate those nations unable or unwilling to keep pace with the times. Today, our army has not merely learned to use the matchlock—this newly invented long-barreled firearm—but has integrated its use into our cultural traditions and daily life. Through this, our infantry and cavalry have forged a formidable reputation on the battlefield."

EDG_Mission_PER_1_20_title:0 "Imperial Silk"
EDG_Mission_PER_1_20_desc:0 "Since Abbas's accession to the throne, the problem of strained finances has constantly troubled him. His father, in order to curry favor, often bestowed excessively generous rewards upon ministers and the Qizilbash Emirs, further worsening the already poor finances of the Safavid dynasty. The prolonged war with the Ottomans required vast quantities of supplies to maintain the army's normal operations for victory. However, the Iranian Plateau, the core region of the state, is itself a barren land, necessitating the import of many essentials. At that time, Iran's primary trading partner was the Mughal Empire to the southeast. Unlike Iran, the Indian subcontinent was undeniably a land of abundance, rich in products, with a population almost ten times that of Iran. Iranians had a great demand for sugar, rice, cotton cloth, indigo, and medicines produced in India, but lacked sufficient exports to maintain a balance, forcing them to use precious metals for payment. This was undoubtedly highly disadvantageous for Iran, which already lacked gold and silver mines. Abbas once issued a ban on the export of gold and silver, but it did not have much effect. He had to find other ways to earn gold and silver from other countries. His ability to achieve this was largely thanks to one thing: raw silk. As our empire develops, our economy must also grow. A prosperous cloth and silk industry can create wealth, provide employment, and enhance our international prestige. Our land is suitable for cultivating silk and cotton, and our people are ready to master the skills of weaving and dyeing. Abbas implemented a series of measures to strengthen control over the raw silk trade. Breaking from the attitude of Iranian rulers over the past centuries towards the fragmented minor powers on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, Abbas was no longer content with vassal relationships. Instead, he eradicated them all, fully incorporating Mazandaran and Gilan into the royal domain. Afterwards, he forcibly relocated thousands of sericulture farmers from the Caucasus region to settle here, responsible for silkworm cultivation."

EDG_Mission_PER_3_16_desc:0 "The Qizilbash are Shia Turkoman warriors hailing from Azerbaijani-speaking tribes. They formed the elite infantry and cavalry forces of the Safavid Sufi order, and their political power continuously expanded, becoming direct rivals to the noble class. As armed adherents of Shia Islam, the Qizilbash followed Shia doctrine and opposed all anti-Shia ideologies within the country. The core of Abbas's reforms was to diminish the absolute dominance of the Qizilbash tribes in the military. Previously, the Safavid army was almost entirely supplied by the Qizilbash tribes. Soldiers obeyed only the commands of their respective tribal emirs, lacked unified command, and were equipped with outdated weaponry. The Shah lacked his own military force, relying solely on his role as the spiritual leader of the Safavid order to influence the emirs of various Qizilbash tribes. This sole bond grew increasingly fragile after the death of Ismail I, leading the Qizilbash to increasingly disregard royal authority and act recklessly within the state. Previous Safavid rulers, in order to maintain this relationship, could only compromise with the Qizilbash. Abbas, however, was different—he was always ready to discard the old order for his own benefit."

A new counterbalance must be established! Abbas created a direct standing army of approximately fifty thousand men, but he did not completely disband the Qizilbash forces. Even after the reforms, they remained the largest component of the army, accounting for about half of the total troops. However, Abbas no longer relied entirely on them.

EDG_Mission_PER_5_18_title:0 "Reform the Governorates"
EDG_Mission_PER_5_18_desc:0 "After the basic structure of the army was formed, Abbas needed to address a new problem. The salaries of the new army were supplied from the Shah's royal treasury, and the newly formed corps still required time to integrate and train before they could officially take to the battlefield. Therefore, Abbas needed sufficient funds to maintain the army's operations. Before Abbas, the income of Safavid rulers came entirely from a few royal provinces within the country and tributes from Qizilbash emirs during festivals. Under such circumstances, the Safavid dynasty could not sustain a large standing army. Thus, Abbas urgently needed to expand his sources of revenue. He first decided to increase the number of royal provinces, and his initial targets were the rebel forces within the country. In fact, in December 1589, before the peace treaty with the Ottomans was concluded, pacification forces had already been dispatched. Over the following year, he crushed the rebels in Isfahan, Kerman, and Pars, swiftly and effectively ending the Safavid dynasty's second civil war. Isfahan, as the territory of the deceased Murshid, was reclaimed by Abbas as a royal province. Kerman and Pars were returned to their original Qizilbash tribes for management. However, unlike before, the new governors were all of Shahisevan origin. A few years later, once the situation had largely stabilized, Abbas handed Kerman over to the Kurd Ganj Ali Khan, one of Abbas's "childhood playmates" from Herat. Alavardi Khan was transferred to the governorship of Pars, becoming the first Ghulam in Safavid history to serve as a provincial governor. This was also part of Abbas's new policy: while the Qizilbash tribes retained their respective fiefs, the governors responsible for managing them were no longer selected from within the tribe as before. Instead, they were directly appointed by the Shah—they could be Shahisevan from other Qizilbash tribes, or even Ghulams."
