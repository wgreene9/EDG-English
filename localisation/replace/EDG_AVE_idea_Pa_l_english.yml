angevin_decentralized_rule_desc:0 "The Plantagenet dynasty rules over vast territories, thus the administrative system of the Franglois Empire relies on local governors and royal kin. Although this decentralized system opposes absolute monarchy, it ensures unimpeded governance in England and the provinces of France."

lessons_of_the_anglo_french_wars_desc:0 "Although the Plantagenet dynasty achieved final victory in the wars against France, reflecting on history, armed conflict between our nation and the Kingdom of France never ceased, even during the Plantagenets' peak. The experiences and lessons from numerous past conflicts, including the Albigensian Crusade and the Quadruple War, continue to shape the discipline and resolve of our military to this day."

reformed_angevin_infantry_desc:0 "During past Anglo-French wars, our nation brought the power of England's traditional Royal Guard infantry to its fullest potential. Yet there is always room for improvement. With the establishment of the Anglo-French personal union, we shall refine their tactics and impart them to our French subjects."

rule_of_the_plantagenet_desc:0 "The Franglois Empire, this personal union uniting the peoples of England and France, is the glorious fruit of the long and distinguished lineage of the House of Plantagenet. The Plantagenet dynasty ended the century-long war between England and France, bringing peace and unity to the peoples on both shores, inaugurating an unprecedented era of peace and stability. The honor of this ancient house will set an example for future dynasties."
