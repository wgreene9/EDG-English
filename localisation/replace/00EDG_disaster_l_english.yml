Our Gentry Council shares its name with the one established by Ivan the Great, yet in practice, it is clearly different. Our Gentry Council serves as a venue for powerful nobles to demand benefits from the monarch. Only the most formidable rulers can rein in the unruly aristocracy, and a strong monarch will inevitably push the nation toward reform, though this is certain to bring turmoil. However, after the death of Ivan II of Volhynia, our new monarch appears to lack the capability to control the domestic nobility. The conflict between royal authority and local nobles has intensified, ultimately leading to an unprecedented rebellion."

An Irish general claiming descent from Cormac mac Airt, Patrick Airt, seized control of the Lordship of Ireland and declared himself High King.

Islamic converts from Georgia and the Caucasus region serendipitously became a force within the army to balance the Qizilbash. In 1601, to relieve Ottoman pressure on Europe, James VI wrote to [Root.Monarch.GetName], urging the Safavid dynasty to take more military action against the Ottoman Turks and stating that Europe was willing to assist in forming an army.

During [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign, the new standing army consisted of the Ghulam Royal Corps, primarily composed of Caucasians, including artillery, musketeers, and infantry. The infantry numbered 12,000 per corps, cavalry 10,000 per corps, all equipped with firearms; the artillery comprised 12,000 men, furnished with 500 bronze cannons. Besides establishing new regular forces, [Root.Monarch.GetName] also expanded the size of the royal guard, increasing it to 3,000 men. The guard's duty was to protect the Shah and royal family members, ready to be dispatched at the Shah's command. Military reforms not only enhanced the army's combat effectiveness, enabling better defense of the state against external threats, but also reduced the number of Qizilbash in the army from the original 60,000-80,000 to 30,000, reversing the situation where Turkmen tribal nobles maintained independent military power and diminishing the Qizilbash's influence within the military."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] centralized supreme judicial authority, exercised by the Divan Beg; local magistrates were elected but required the Shah's approval.

In effect, through this social mobility, [Root.Monarch.GetName] dismantled the traditional aristocratic political model, declaring that there should be no hereditary nobility in the Safavid dynasty. During [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule, the rule of law was integrated throughout the reform process, authorizing local officials to strictly inspect law enforcement and impose severe penalties on violators. Leveraging factors of social mobility, [Root.Monarch.GetName] achieved the objectives of various institutional goals and established a new elite class, replacing the Qizilbash with Caucasians and Persians, further weakening the power of Turkmen tribal nobility.

This was also part of Abbas's new policy: although the Redhead tribes retained their respective fiefs, the governors responsible for managing them were no longer selected from within their own tribes as before but were directly appointed by the Shah. They might be Shahsevan from other Redhead tribes, or even ghulams.

EDG_disaster_ming_crisis.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is insatiably greedy. To fund an extravagantly wasteful lifestyle and amass gold, silver, and treasures, he has devised a "profitable method": under the pretext of mining and taxation, he has dispatched large numbers of eunuchs to serve as mining supervisors and tax commissioners across the country to plunder the people's wealth. Wherever these mining supervisors and tax commissioners go: regardless of whether land contains mines or not, there is the misery of forced mining and taxation contracts; regardless of whether the people consent or not, there is the misery of imposed mining and tax quotas. Pointing at a house and threatening, "There are mines there!" instantly ruins the family. Pointing at goods and intimidating, "They have evaded taxes!" instantly empties the coffers. They employ unverifiable figures, use unscrupulous individuals, and commit acts devoid of heavenly principle and royal law. Roughly speaking, for every ten parts collected: one part enters the imperial treasury, two are embezzled by the commissioners, three are divided among their attendants, and four are extorted by local ruffians. This does not include local provisions, seasonal gifts, harassment by courier stations, and corrupt officials using the system for profit. This is essentially public plunder in the regions under the emperor's banner. The mining supervisors, tax commissioners, and their underlings commit every conceivable evil, inciting resistance from urban populations. In a chain reaction, this has triggered a massive rebellion by merchants and artisans."

Leveraging their closeness to the emperor, they acquired large estates through petitions and other means. Ordinary bureaucratic landlords, the so-called gentry families, also used their politically advantageous positions to seize and concentrate land through cunning and force. Under this frenzied land annexation by official-gentry landlords, land became highly concentrated by the late [Root.GetAdjective] period. The vast majority of peasants were stripped of their land, becoming tenants or servants of the official-gentry landlords, or forced into vagrancy. Crushing taxes became unbearable for the peasants, leading to mass flight. Local officials, indifferent to the peasants' plight, used harsh punishments to pursue tax arrears, even ordering current households to pay the taxes of those who had fled. Whenever the authorities began tax collection, the sounds of pursuit and beating were utterly tragic. Even during the Wanli era, it was said, "starving and emaciated men, with not half a bean in their bellies, still have their hands and feet bound in pillories." A few years ago, the magistrate of Lintong County, Shaanxi, Xu Zhongze, "was excessively strict in tax collection. On each comparison day, the ten chiefs bathed in the hot springs, turning the waters red." An official wrote in his book: "I once passed through En County and saw a lower-ranked magistrate pursuing tax grain. Blood flowed, filling the steps. Pitiable!" The extreme land annexation and the court's limitless taxation under the [Root.GetAdjective] dynasty vastly increased the peasants' burdens, sparking a massive rebellion."

Twenty li beyond the border, I saw people scraping flesh from corpses by the roadside like butchering pigs or dogs, not avoiding others, and people watching thought it nothing strange. My hair stood on end. After traveling another half-day, I saw an old woman holding a dead child, cooking it while weeping. I asked, "Since you intend to eat it, why weep?" She replied, "This is my child. If I abandon it, others will eat it. So I'd rather fill my own stomach." For days after, I could not eat with relish. At that moment, if something could relieve death, I would have sacrificed myself without hesitation. Upon first arriving in the capital, these horrifying scenes still weighed on my heart. After two or three days, meeting friends, toasting and calling to each other, the earlier events became half-remembered, half-forgotten. Then, enticing songs filled the ears, dazzling splendor seized the eyes, and the heart-wrenching, nose-stinging sights of yesterday melted away. Alas, I am a man who knows hunger—its feeling, its taste—all commonly seen and personally tasted. Yet even I gradually forgot as distance grew. How much harder, then, for those high in the nine heavens, ten thousand li away, with situations never before seen, to hope they understand without being told, to feel pain without cause? Is it not difficult?'\n\nWidespread famine has displaced masses of common people, turning them into refugees, a highly destabilizing force in society. These refugees possess no property or means of production yet are still forced by the authorities to pay tribute; otherwise, they face severe punishment. The court's series of tyrannical policies have ultimately sparked a large-scale peasant uprising."

The 'Perfecti' must all observe regulations such as fasting, abstinence, refraining from lies and oaths. Ordinary believers are not required to follow ascetic rules; they only need to receive the consolamentum, live ordinary lives, and are not obliged to adhere to strict religious precepts. However, they must fully respect the 'Perfecti' and completely obey their commands.\n\nThe 'Perfecti' are the true adherents of the faith, receiving baptism—the ritual of imparting the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands—after a prolonged period of testing. Besides conducting worship and preaching, the Perfecti also engage in almsgiving, relief work, and educational activities such as establishing schools. If a Perfectus later fails to maintain the standards of one who has received the consolamentum, they must undergo re-baptism by the Holy Spirit, which entails voluntary death by starvation or suffocation.\n\nOur supreme ruler has long been portrayed as a model 'Perfectus.' Even if there were domestic opponents who believed our ruler did not meet the standards of a 'Perfectus,' their dissent would vanish through violent means. However, with the onset of the Reformation, past repressive policies have gradually lost their effectiveness. An increasing number of people have begun to doubt the ruler's authority, claiming that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is merely an ordinary believer.

EDG_BTA_civil_war.1.d:0 "The elective assembly led by the three great families—Bruce, Balliol, and de Umfraville—has become an indelible mark upon every inch of Britannia's soil. In the past, Scottish poets ardently praised this system as 'the most humble and balanced institution.' Lords and bishops from across the nation gathered in Edinburgh to choose from among three candidates the monarch best suited to lead Scotland. Each king was nominated by the elective assembly, each king in his prime, each king vigorous and strong, each king a philosopher-king in Plato's sense. Some even compared this period to Rome's era of the Five Good Emperors—adopted emperors ruling an eternally splendid realm. Yet Rome's triumphal columns inevitably crumbled under the cumulative weathering, becoming lamentable ruins.\n\nToday, the gilding on Scotland's elective assembly has entirely worn away. Clouds of dispute and suspicion loom over Britannia. The consensus among the three great families has gradually been replaced by growing disagreements. Each desires to claim the Stone of Scone for themselves, permitting no others to touch it. The head of the hereditary convener family, the Stuarts, strives to maintain balance and unity among the three parties, but Britannia's three giants have long been strange bedfellows, with only superficial harmony remaining.\n\nBefore the master of Britannia—[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]—lies a bold plan: to make the Britannian throne hereditary. His crown would pass to his son, the Duke of Rothesay, and from the Duke of Rothesay to a new Duke of Rothesay... Yet this plan is also perilous. It means forcibly binding the other two mutually suspicious families onto the same war chariot. Civil war is inevitable—a desperate gamble with families as the stakes, where the winner takes all and the loser is left with nothing."

The armies of the two major factions engage in relentless military conflict; scenes of burning, killing, and plunder unfold repeatedly in the cities, posing immense threats to the lives and property of the people. This state is no ordinary turmoil but near anarchy, like a beast unleashed, wreaking havoc across all Britannia.\n\nWhen the palace finally fell to the rebels, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat upon the throne, clad in formal attire, crowned, with the scepter resting upon his lap, composed and facing the soldiers who stormed the hall. These soldiers bore long spears gleaming coldly and stained with blood, yet the king showed no fear, his demeanor calm and steady, as if he had nothing left to fear, nothing left to lose. [Root.Monarch.GetName] retrieved a small vial from his sleeve and drank.

EDG_BTA_War_of_heresy.1.d:0 "At first, no one realized this was a civil war. It was merely a failed sermon, a shocked Grand Celtic Church canon, a group of angry peasants swept up by heretical ideas—until this calamity became intimately connected to us. The Grand Celtic Church was the product of Britannia's clean break with Rome, incorporating more Celtic elements into its liturgy: hanging the Celtic cross at the church center, chanting scripture in Scottish Highland Gaelic. Yet simultaneously, the Celtic Church retained many Catholic elements, including the primacy of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. In the eyes of peasants across the British Isles, it simply changed from a clergy speaking Latin to a clergy speaking only Celtic, not Latin. Eventually, a sect called the 'Celtic Cathars' emerged, advocating the combination of Celtic Church fundamentals with Cathar doctrine. They argued that clergy should remain poor, church properties be liquidated, the sacred status of corrupt clergy denied, all ecclesiastical offices and hierarchies inherited from the Grand Celtic Church destroyed, all icons smashed, and all sacraments boycotted. These dangerous elements roamed the countryside of Britannia, inciting peasants to attack churches and clergy. Finally, the sword of Damocles fell. When a priest sided with a landlord in a land dispute, angry peasants burned the church and lynched that priest. One village fell under the control of the Celtic Cathars. Soon, half a county's countryside was ignited by this rebellious spark. These 'heretics' sparked a civil war in Britannia, later known in history as the War of the Black Lollards."
EDG_BTA_War_of_heresy.2.d:0 "Across the countryside of the West Midlands and Sussex, abandoned lands due to the War of the Black Lollards are everywhere visible. Weeds have replaced the once plump, glossy wheat grains. On the few plots still receiving careful care, those laboring are women usually more skilled in weaving and the thin children by their mothers' sides. Their husbands or fathers may already lie buried on battlefields a hundred miles away in Lancashire or Cornwall. Under soldiers' escort, the disheveled Grand Celtic Church priests returned to their parishes, only to find the churches reduced to rubble, the gilding of sanctuaries plundered. The War of the Black Lollards has ended, but healing the scars it left will clearly require much more time. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the chief minister are riding horseback, returning from the front lines to the most comfortable palace with twenty attendants. The Archbishop of Canterbury is already prepared to welcome the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the choir rehearses new hymns praising [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for once again defeating a formidable enemy, even if this time the enemy came from among his own subjects.\n\n'Have the heretics truly quieted down?'\n\n'Your Majesty, I believe they may one day return to this path.

EDG_BTA_economic_problem_1.1.d:0 "In the mid-15th century, due to a sharp increase in demand for woolen cloth, the main English export, the raw material wool became scarce and highly priced in the European market. Concurrently, during the Hundred Years' War, England altered its wool usage, restricting exports to ensure domestic demand.\n\nThe rising wool price directly propelled the development of sheep farming. Small and medium landlords in the countryside employed various means to seize common lands, plunder peasant lands, and vigorously engage in sheep farming. These new nobles, operating in a capitalist manner, managed sheep farming on a large scale, relentlessly pursuing high profits. Not only was sheep farming cheaper than crop cultivation, but it also involved less 'labor waste' and allowed hiring workers at lower wages. They also reduced management costs to offset losses from war, natural disasters, and the development of the commodity economy. Thus, villages and fields gradually turned into pastures.\n\nFeudal landlords, new nobles, and the emerging bourgeoisie first seized remnants of ancient village commons, primeval forests, and marshes. They forcibly enclosed these lands with fences, walls, and ditches as pastures, with large sheep owners hiring few workers to manage flocks. These lands were originally cultivated by peasants' ancestors and had been their livelihood foundation for centuries.\n\nIn the era of Europe's 'Price Revolution,' small and medium nobles were hit hardest. Their incomes were modest, and due to currency devaluation and sharply rising living costs, their standard of living declined. Threatened by bankruptcy, small and medium nobles seized peasants' common lands, while great nobles openly plundered common lands with bands of demobilized soldiers.\n\nThe Enclosure Movement brought endless suffering to small peasants. Sheep, once docile and requiring little, now became greedy and fierce, even 'devouring people,' trampling our fields, homes, and cities. Many independent small peasant landowners' plots, common lands, and state lands were also seized by large tenant farmers. Almost all newly enclosed lands became pastures, driving masses of peasants into towns seeking work. Urban craft workshops, temporarily unable to absorb them, left displaced peasants homeless."

They cited classical texts, attempting to prove to the council that mercenaries and standing armies should be under a unified command system, as Plato suggested—Sforza's military talents naturally warranted this position. As the Council of Philosophers passed this resolution, members who had accepted Sforza's bribes and private overtures smiled with delight...\n\nBut many liberals within the Ambrosian Republic realized this act would make Sforza and his corrupt faction the true supreme rulers of the Duchy of Lombardy. They impeached Sforza in the Council of Philosophers, demanding his expulsion, which shook the entire republic. Handling the Sforza issue became the focus of all Lombardy. The enraged Sforza presented an ultimatum to the Council of Philosophers: either accept his military autocracy or prepare to face him once again on the battlefield. The liberals of the Council of Philosophers faced backlash, and the council's choice would be..."

His conduct increasingly resembles that of his father-in-law, the old Duke Filippo. If the Council of Philosophers continues on this trajectory, it will once again fall from a position of real power back to its original advisory role.\n\nConsequently, Sforza has made many enemies within the Golden Ambrosian Republic. The idealist politicians who founded the republic suspect him of coveting its authority. The Council of Philosophers has clearly split into two factions. The liberals believe Sforza is already the greatest threat to the Lombard Republic; they need to suppress his influence as much as possible, remove his allies and spies, and defend the council's supreme status and the republic's continuity—if they could politely escort him out of the country, that would be even better. The conservatives argue that as Duke Filippo's son-in-law, Sforza is inherently the best heir to the old duke's legacy. Even if his wife is illegitimate, since Duke Filippo had no legal heirs, based on blood relations he should become the next duke. He would still respect the Council of Philosophers and Lombard guilds. They criticize the Golden Ambrosian Republic as a doomed experiment, proving the lofty ideals of the republic's founders entirely impractical; the people are calling for a duke's return, and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is fully qualified to wield public authority and restore order to [Root.GetName].

flavor_mlo.1.d:0 "Filippo Visconti, Duke of Milan and Modena, protector of the Republic of Verona, Vicar of Italy—later dubbed the 'King of Lombardy' by posterity—has suddenly passed away. He reunited his father's crumbling domains, defeated the coalition attempting to crush Milan, became the true master of Italy and a de facto elector, even prompting the Emperor, to win over Italian princes, to transfer the electoral dignity of the Archbishop of Mainz to the Archbishop of Milan, a position long controlled by the Visconti family. His brilliant achievements relied on the substantial financial support of Italy's guilds; each ducat flowing into Filippo's coffers was reciprocated with merchants' eager participation in governance. Elsewhere in Europe, merchants and guilds never participated as deeply in the politics of a true kingdom—rather than a small autonomous city—as in Lombardy. The bourgeoisie communicated with the duke through their spokesmen, renowned orators, scholars from the University of Pavia, and profound thinkers. In Lombardy, they were collectively called 'philosophers,' and their advisory assembly was known as the 'Council of Philosophers.' Although the Council had no legal authority, based on the guilds' strong support and the philosophers' immense prestige in Lombardy, Duke Filippo always respected its collective opinions. Capitalism in Lombardy developed faster than in any other Italian state; Lombard politics were the most enlightened in Italy. This mechanism seemed capable of enduring. But Filippo Visconti is gone, leaving no widely acknowledged heir. Lombardy is leaderless, and monarchs elsewhere are busy examining their genealogies, hoping to profit from Lombardy's succession crisis.\n\nThe Council of Philosophers transformed instantly from an advisory body into Lombardy's de facto parliament, for only they possessed the prestige to command all Lombardy. Conservatives wished to invite a foreign monarch to end Lombardy's chaos, but many merchants feared a foreign ruler would not respect Lombardy's native merchants and philosophers. As the council deadlocked, a group of radical scholars from the University of Pavia stepped forward. They claimed to follow Plato's guidelines, establishing an 'ideal state ruled by philosophers' rather than a duke; only the wisest should lead Lombardy. They fervently depicted the beauties of a philosopher-governed state. Intense debate lasted from noon to midnight, but council members lingered, knowing this night would decide Lombardy's fate. In heated exchanges, they forgot time and weariness. Ultimately, the radicals' view gained support from most participants. The duke is gone; Lombardy has abandoned the throne. The Council of Philosophers swore before Saint Ambrose to guard Lombardy's glory. As the council ended, a golden sunrise hung east of Milan, gentle sunlight like the smile of Saint Ambrose on an icon. A republic was born; claimants to the ducal throne were expelled from the city. The new republic was named the Golden Ambrosian Republic, after the 4th-century Bishop of Milan."

His life was spent traversing Italy, seeking employers embroiled in war and reeking of wealth, filling his pockets with ducats from their hands. Now, Sforza prepares for the biggest transaction of his life—his acquisition target is all of Lombardy.\n\nSforza's wife, Bianca Maria Visconti, is Duke Filippo's illegitimate daughter. Without sons, Duke Filippo doted on this daughter; apart from lacking inheritance rights, she differed little from a true ducal daughter. At age five, she was betrothed to Sforza, over twenty years her senior, and married in 1441 at the Abbey of San Sigismondo in Cremona with the ceremony befitting a true ducal daughter. During Milan's ducal vacancy, she strongly encouraged her husband to reclaim her father's throne.\n\nOf course, Sforza knew he could not challenge Milan's towering walls without cause. To crush those smug merchants and their so-called philosophers—that rabble they kept—he must break them from within Milan. Relying on his wife's accumulated prestige and networks within Milan, Sforza successfully won over a group of disgruntled nobles and money-minded philosophers willing to support his claim to the Visconti legacy. They strive to push the Council of Philosophers to grant Sforza more power, ensuring he obtains the Duchy of Lombardy through his wife, the former duke's illegitimate daughter."

Hugues VII, inheriting the throne after his father signed the humiliating Treaty of Caen, faced peril. A peasant girl named Jeanne d'Arc led armies loyal to the monarchy to block Lotharingian forces aiming to march to Reims for coronation. Over years of war, as Hugues VII's guard, Jeanne fought alongside him, repelling the allied armies of Lotharingia and England and the opportunistic raids of the Arlesians. They shattered Lotharingian King Louis VII's dream of usurping the French throne, leveraging home advantage and striking at the core to divide the three armies. Ultimately, after prolonged stalemate, news of rebellion among Lotharingia's German vassals arrived; Hugues VII successfully defended his crown. He was regarded by the French populace as equal to Emperor Aurelian, 'Restitutor Orbis,' and called 'the Victorious King.'\n\nYet beneath the Victorious King's reign, undercurrents surged. Despite the French king's centralist policies blazing like wildfire, constrained by the era, French royal authority still relied on vassals across the realm. The Kingdom of France stood at a crossroads between centralism and feudalism; central-local conflicts grew daily, evident in various royal princes' coveting of the Parisian throne. These Capetian branches long coveted the crown, eagerly waiting for King Hugues's demise to proclaim their claims. Non-dynastic lords, though excluded from succession by blood, were far from bystanders in this turmoil; they yearned to establish their own dynasties as France's old order crumbled."

Yet unifying all Italy was not entirely beneficial for the republic. Veneto landowners still secretly courted the Emperor; Calabrian Catholics and descendants of Sicilian Greeks seemed inherently hostile to the republic. Though the papacy nominally left Rome, many Catholics simply went underground, continuing to lead subversion against the republic. Republican institutions ground to a halt. Having lost feudalism and the Catholic Church as governance tools, the nascent republic suddenly found itself powerless to govern Italy, with political and economic problems proliferating. The populace, weary from years of military mutinies, lost enthusiasm for religious revolution. Republic conscripts, long unpaid, teetered on mutiny's edge, while remaining funds barely met Arlesian mercenaries' demands. Worse, the republic's excessive democratic procedures led to terrifying administrative inefficiency, causing waterworks decay and municipal rigidity, making Italians despise the republic's sluggish governance. Church autonomy allowed local elites to hide property under the Church's name, concealing vast lands, wealth, and population—the republic's tax base and manpower veiled in shadow. In the worst regions, city governments even relied on Cathar clergy to maintain basic social order.\nMeanwhile, though the Church possessed great wealth and influence, it remained excluded from the political core, creating immense social discontent and hidden risks.\nMany councilors wished to emulate our neighbor Arles and become a monarchy, but this proposal failed as no one could gain unanimous support. Recently, a group of Cathar clergy led Arlesian mercenaries into the council, announcing its dissolution and that power would be held by a group of esteemed clergy within Catharism—'the Elders.' These clergy claimed they were forced to intervene in secular affairs merely to maintain Cathar stability. In practice, a relatively flat theocratic republic replaced the former republic."

He repeatedly declared this his life's final and greatest regret.\n\nThe old Sultan's coffin lay forgotten deep within the palace for a full forty-seven days. Finally, guards from the palace pooled enough gold coins to bury the old Sultan beside a date palm within the palace grounds. With Safar I's death, restless royal members within the empire stepped to the forefront. Numerous powerful collateral ministers vied for the throne of such a vast empire. After countless conspiracies, assassinations, alliances, and betrayals, the last surviving fortunate one ascended the imperial throne. But [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s victory did not mean he controlled the empire; [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decrees could not extend beyond $CAPITAL$. Emirs across the lands acted independently, ignoring edicts from the capital. Clearly, they had received no favor from the new Malik and were unwilling to immediately offer loyalty to this Malik.\n\nAt this moment, the long-exiled but renowned Prince Zaid sounded the horn of return at the border. He led his elite mercenary corps from Persia to the empire's old capital, Sahada, gained support from the emirs of Hejaz and Yemen, recruited soldiers loyal to himself, and marched grandly toward Cairo. Some Mamluks had already turned to curry favor with Zaid, persuading—even threatening—[Root.Monarch.GetName] to abdicate, allowing Safar I's second son Zaid to succeed. But obviously, [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not intend to surrender without a fight. He led an elite Mamluk force out of the city to engage in battle."

Submerged in the surging Nile was not only his life but also that once-glorious, passionate dream. Under the starlit sky, echoes of his mournful cries as he was nailed into an ancient pharaoh's golden coffin—the endless lament of the dead for power, a desperate cry of despair. As the golden coffin slowly sank into the tranquil Nile, the waters seemed to grow darker with its descent, undercurrents stirring, peering into the fate of all. The Caliph's death swept like a north wind over burning grassland, bringing unrestrained turmoil and division. Sunni believers, like enraged lions, lost their king's guidance, hearts ablaze with towering fury and thirst for vengeance; their faith blazed like fire, spreading across this ancient land. Thus, believers everywhere became hidden shadows, launching storm-like attacks in lone-wolf style, targeting tax officials and Shia clerics directly. Sword blades gleamed coldly in the night, as if avenging lost glory. Those petty officials, heads held high like foxes borrowing a tiger's might, unaware that desperate believers crept near like hungry wolves. Piercing blades sliced the night sky; passion and faith intertwined like a roaring storm, sweeping over all innocent bodies. In their hearts surged not only grief for the Abbasid Caliph's tragic fate but also insistence on faith and dignity, transforming into motive force, burning every fearless soul. Under the gale's cover, groups of believers clad in darkness moved like vultures circling the night sky, swift and deadly. Their assaults gave no warning, nimble and lethal like hidden currents along the Nile's banks, striking suddenly, catching officials just relaxing off guard. Each night, red blood soaked white sands; low groans echoed among ancient pyramids, sorrowful and despairing, as if lamenting every fallen warrior of the past. Shia clerics also became innocent victims swept by the storm; superstitious and fanatical believers surrounded them, wielding their challenge to authority and thirst for faith. Struggles buried deep in historical dust revived like ancient pharaohs resurrected, manipulating it all. Their ideals and beliefs seemed baptized through struggle's flames, growing firmer and more resolute.'\n\nWhen copies of this article reached [Root.Monarch.GetName], the streets and alleys of Cairo and Iskandariya were plastered with this parallel-prose manifesto. The Sunnis launched an unprecedented movement in Egypt, akin to the Abbasid Revolution the Umayyads faced in Persia—but now, the force led by the Abbasid Caliph shifted from Shia to Sunni. Many Sunni fanatics dragged local Shia officials from their residences, torturing them to death; across the nation, dismembered, flayed Shia ulama hung from city gates. As many officials we appointed actually adhered to Sunni faith, they turned a blind eye to these atrocities, even fanning the flames in secret. Undoubtedly, although in the past a fragile balance existed between Shia and Sunni in the Sahada Empire, this balance was finally shattered. The Sunnis launched an unprecedented 'revolution.'"

But when Harun al-Rashid arrived in Egypt, everything seemed different.\n\nNamed Harun al-Rashid, sharing the name of the third Abbasid Caliph, he was the son of Caliph Mustaqfi al-Abbas, surviving the Malik War. Loyal Mamluks protected Mustaqfi, taking him from Egypt to distant Isfahan, where a small order was established. In Isfahan, the capable warrior Mamluks and the brave, erudite Abu Ibrahim became his protectors, while eleven elders well-versed in Islamic law accompanied his growth. Together they educated Harun al-Rashid, informing him of his mission from childhood, treating him as a deity for education and training. The order they founded in Isfahan attracted countless Sunni believers ravaged by Iran's wars, coming to worship. They claimed they would rather worship a living person in Isfahan than a dead one in Mecca. Extremist legal thought and religious worship led Harun al-Rashid to believe himself an omnipotent, invincible god, convinced he would one day return to Egypt and rebuild the Abbasid Empire.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Mamluks and other Sunni military strategists who joined, Harun al-Rashid eventually became a highly skilled, militarily adept schemer. At age 17, he personally shot a bear at close range, skinned it, and made a cloak; this bear skin still hangs high in a mosque in Isfahan, revered as a relic left by Harun al-Rashid.\n\nAs the Sunni movement within the Sahada Empire gradually intensified, Harun al-Rashid perceived the perfect moment.

In such an environment, correct, logical, and practically relevant exegetical methods are always arbitrarily denied and fiercely attacked by ulama of scant learning but considerable influence, leading our religious system to be filled with incompetent sycophants and factionalists, lacking talented individuals capable of genuinely developing Islamic scholarship.\n\nA few days ago, a religious debate in $CAPITAL$ exposed this issue. An excellent young scholar cited a Quranic verse: 'Do not let anyone turn you away from Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.' The grand mufti present, failing to recognize the quote came directly from the Quran, launched a ruthless attack: 'Are young scholars nowadays so fanatical?'

When faith yields to interest, earthly kingdoms prosper. First Iskandar, then Antioch; today Jerusalem, tomorrow the Seven Hills. The Sahadan state swept across the world like a flood, but not without cost. When faith bows to interest, the devout receive the source of calamity.\n\nA decade ago, a Coptic scholar named Isaac delivered a grand speech before Iskandar Cathedral. This Isaac enjoyed high academic renown; even the Archbishop of Iskandar reportedly praised his theories. Over the past decade, he gained support from tens of thousands of Copts; many regarded him as a religious authority and trendsetter. Isaac conducted missionary activities across most of the empire. Generous, frequently funding Coptic guilds and churches everywhere, he earned great fame and influence. Many churches bore his name; he almost became a new saint within Coptic Christianity. Many witnessed him leap into boiling oil unscathed; rumors claimed he cured terminal believers and restored fertility to barren middle-aged women. Of course, before the incident, besides immense fame and fervent preaching style, this Isaac held no unique distinction. Like other Coptic clergy, he traveled among churches, respectfully cooperating with imperial bureaucrats, maintaining close ties. Many bureaucrats within the empire—whether Shia or Coptic—greatly respected Isaac.\n\nBut recently, this Coptic cleric stirred a frenzied wave in Iskandar.\n\nHe proclaimed himself 'the Messiah,' calling believers to rebel against [Root.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetName]—igniting a wave of Coptic fervor across Egypt and other vast regions of the empire. Undoubtedly, over the past decades, Isaac had been contacting other Coptic clergy and bishops, weaving a vast, sharp rebellion network under the empire's shadow, maintained by the Coptic Church, aimed at splitting the entire empire.\n\nAlthough Isaac was swiftly arrested and executed locally in Iskandar—the executioner first flayed five hundred cuts, whipped him with spiked iron lashes until bloody, gouged out eyes, ears, nose, and tongue, then crucified him, finally applying fire. The Iskandar magistrate sought to intimidate Copts across the empire, but this provoked extreme grief and rage among Copts. Many fanatical Coptic believers claimed Isaac would resurrect like Christ after seven days! Enraged, the judge ordered immediate measures at the execution ground. Before the public, Isaac's corpse was dismembered, ground into pulp by a waterwheel, spread over the execution ground, guarded by hundreds of soldiers."

Using his immense influence, he gained popular support, preaching millenarianism and other religious fanaticism. More importantly, he had an identical twin brother.\n\nThe Copts calculated the foggy day in Iskandar, bribed our qadi to schedule the execution seven days later. They also bribed patrolling soldiers and Mamluks managing the site, hiding Isaac's remains under the scaffold. After all preparations, they informed the Iskandar governor.\n\nOnce the governor and others confirmed Isaac's remains' disappearance, Isaac's twin brother reappeared on a high tower, while pre-arranged Copts would spread this news across the empire!\n\nThis Jew also provided other Coptic intelligence, including the twin brother's location and Copts' subsequent plans.

After the civil war between Muslims and Copts erupted, he diligently transported supplies for Coptic forces. He trusted every crew member deeply; each operation was highly confidential, and his routes couldn't be detected by Sahada's clumsy Greek-commanded navy—unless there were traitors among his crew—but so far, that hadn't happened.\n\nWhen the Nazaniel entered Iskandar as usual, Philip sensed something unusual in the salty sea breeze. Merchant fleets from Sicily, France, Iberia, and the Maghreb lay quietly in the harbor, yet no ship sailed out; the port was eerily silent, hardly any workers on the docks.

He knew this was the Muslim army's horn; he'd heard it countless times during Sahada's conquests, but now he stood opposite it. Realization struck; he yelled for the first mate to accelerate out of the harbor, but too late.\n\nWarships from nowhere blocked retreat; armies hidden in the port swarmed out, releasing fire that ignited oil on the sea.

Yet sadly, extinguishing resistance fire seemed easier than imagined.\n\nWhen Muslim forces used simple explosives to destroy millennia-old Greek temples, James inside had no time to flee; his final fate became a smear of debris stuck to stone columns."

His eyes were deep and alert, like a seasoned warrior; though his status was humble, he bore significant responsibility in this bustling post. On this road connecting the empire, he was the nexus, the listener to stories of travelers and dust-drivers.\n\nThough lowly in rank, passion and responsibility often urged him to care for every detail of the post and its visitors. He strove to keep the station tidy, ensuring passersby could rest briefly, drink hot tea, enjoy momentary peace. In his heart, this was not merely duty but deep love for this land and its people. Each dusk, Ibrahim stood at the door, watching carriages pass, wheels grinding against earth echoing in the air. He understood travelers carried not just personal journeys but intricate power games from various regions. High-ranking governors often saw him as an insignificant pebble, yet he possessed a unique perspective, witnessing how power subtly shifted across this vast new frontier.\n\nOver time, the station master gradually realized central authority was weakening in this land, providing loose soil for local governors' rise. Whenever a governor and his arrogant entourage swaggered into the post, unease flickered in the master's heart. Local governors' power networks began like resilient vines, quietly climbing soil in all directions, nurturing independent factions. Though insignificant, in the approaching storm, he sensed impending change not just for the empire's fate but his own life.\n\nEach deep night, the master sat alone on a wooden bench in the post's backyard, gazing at distant stars, pondering future variables. Echoes of distant hoofbeats seemed to foretell coming turmoil. He knew on this land he might not alter history's course, but he would guard the post in his own way, protecting lost travelers and the approaching wind.\n\nThe next day, the post received new news—\n\nThe empire's mightiest governor had raised the banner of rebellion.\n\nSoon, alarming messages reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s palace. The core of [Root.GetUsableName]'s local administration—the provinces—had begun openly defying the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

The Malik must maneuver within a political environment filled with symbols—omens, bizarre cosmologies, and so-called hidden powers—more pervasive and real on Iranian soil than any principle, ideal, or legal tradition.\n\nHowever, the Malik fundamentally cannot and will never achieve this—such governance demands the monarch expend vast time and energy locating cultural sites scattered across a broad cultural realm and demonstrating interactive ability—the Sahadan state's political structure precludes the Malik from ruling this way.\n\nThis leads to the rapid expansion of local power and influence among intermediate groups—saints, Sufis, storytellers, astrologers, doctors, etc. The Safaviyya of Ardabil stands out among these.

Hazaraspid rulers, bearing the title 'Thousand Horses,' gradually expanded their influence during the Ilkhanate period. When the Great Khans forgot their horseback traditions, indulging in the pleasures of Soltaniyeh, only those who held the whip could remain unscathed during the empire's total collapse in 1335. Several heirs barely warmed the Ilkhan's throne before passing it to successors. Of course, facing the Tayichiud's Chobanids controlling the northwest and the Jalayirids holding fertile lands, the Hazaraspids, nestled in the mountains, clearly lacked the strength to compete.\n\nBut the Hazaraspids' keen sense of smell found a means to enhance their legitimacy. After the Golden Horde's army breached Tabriz, the so-called Ilkhanate monarch, the dubious Nushirwan, disappeared amidst the flames of war. The Hazaraspids secretly installed the deposed former Great Khatun Sati Beg. On the matter of whether to install a female monarch, these Kurds debated fiercely internally. Yet to boost legitimacy, a group of Kurds disguised as merchants ultimately hid Sati Beg, Öljaitü's daughter, within a Persian carpet to smuggle her out of the city. Sati Beg married for the fourth time after unions with Amir Choban, Arpa Khan, and Suleiman Khan. As various claimants met untimely deaths or perished from illness, by 1330, Khatun Sati Beg became the sole legitimate heir; various factions reluctantly acknowledged this puppet khatun's legitimacy. In 1345, Sati Beg died; her son Surgan and his descendants inherited the puppet khanate to this day.\n\nThough Hazaraspid rulers, as 'Pillars of the State,' effectively controlled the Ilkhanate's highest authority, the Hazaraspids were not the Ilkhanate's nominal legitimate rulers. Successive 'Pillars'' legitimacy faced constant questioning; waves opposing the Hazaraspid family leaders never ceased, and this reached a peak in $YEAR$.\n\nJust days ago, the Ilkhan we controlled escaped from $CAPITAL$, found emirs willing to support his restoration, and incited a massive rebellion against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] within the country."

This act not only stirred unrest along the borders but also emboldened the Karaman Bey in the east, who sought to seize territories amidst the chaos.\nSimultaneously, the nation's interior was swept up in turmoil over religious issues. A sudden religious uprising engulfed Edirne, with heretics even massacring Muslims in some areas; before this unrest could subside, a devastating fire struck Edirne. This blaze consumed numerous houses and warehouses and destroyed the city's economic lifeline, further inflaming popular discontent.\nAt this critical juncture, the young Sultan Muhammad decided to devalue the silver coinage by one-fifth in response to external crises. However, this inexperienced move, while increasing fiscal revenue, led to unforeseen difficulties: the salaried Kapikulu troops, though receiving the same number of coins as before, found their actual income reduced due to the lower silver content.\nThe Grand Vizier Çandarli, who sought to manipulate the Sultan, began inciting the Kapikulu to rise against him.

The Pope's calls for a crusade fell on deaf ears. And the envoys they sent to sue for peace?

In early winter, the Ottoman Empire issued orders and calls in every province in the west and east, demanding preparation for countless masons and a corresponding number of laborers, lime burners, and all manner of materials needed for construction and transport. All this had to be ready by spring, for building a fortress on the Bosphorus and above Constantinople to slit the throat of the Romans.\nWhen the Romans heard this dreadful news, Christians residing in both Constantinople and Thrace felt profound anguish and shock. Among them, there was no other topic of conversation or expression but lamentation:\n'The end of Constantinople is near; now is the hour our nation perishes; now is the day the Antichrist's era arrives; where shall we go? O Lord, take our lives, do not let your servants witness the destruction of Constantinople with their own eyes. O Lord, where are its protecting saints?'\nNot only the inhabitants of Constantinople voiced such laments, but Latin Christians scattered in the east, the islands, and even the west also cried out in the same manner.

The Janissaries, a group wielding immense military power within the empire, were accustomed to strong leadership and grew progressively dissatisfied with the feeble [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They yearned for a sovereign who could lead them to further conquests, glory, and wealth.\n\nMeanwhile, the empire's magnates, each harboring their own schemes, recognized [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s inability to maintain control. Thus, they threw their support behind different princes, placing their own pawns on the board in hopes of securing the greatest advantage from the impending power transition. Propelled by the forces behind these magnates and Janissary factions, these princes engaged in brutal internecine warfare across the provinces.\n\nPrince Ahmed might have been recruiting troops and gathering supplies in a province of Anatolia, backed by local magnates providing provisions and arms. Meanwhile, Prince Selim marshaled his forces in a Balkan province, supported by elements within the Janissaries. Driven by their desire for the supreme Sultanic throne, the two princes launched into fierce conflict.\n\nThe provinces became their battlegrounds. Villages were burned, and common folk displaced. Once-thriving trade routes were severed, merchants dared not travel, and the imperial economy suffered a severe blow. Standing within his palace in Istanbul, witnessing the empire descend into such chaos, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempted mediation. He sent emissaries to the princes, but they were either rebuffed or slain. His decrees became worthless scraps of paper in the provinces; no prince was willing to heed the words of their weak father.\n\nThe entire Ottoman Empire teetered amidst the princes' strife, plunged into turmoil from the court down to the local administrations. Ministers split into factions supporting different princes, and courtly arguments raged incessantly. The Janissaries grew even more unrestrained during this discord, sometimes even seizing provincial resources under the pretext of supporting their chosen prince.\n\nAmidst this vast chaos, the future of the Ottoman Empire grew dim and perilous, like a great ship losing its bearing in a storm, at risk of foundering at any moment. And in this immense struggle, Prince Selim, known as 'the Grim,' emerged as the dark horse most likely to prevail."

In contrast, Selim, who handled these matters decisively and without mercy, won the favor of the Kapikulu corps.\n\nThe last chance for this eldest brother of Selim came when [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared: 'I will choose the eldest among my children as heir and bestow the throne upon him.' Upon hearing this, Selim, in a fit of impulse, marched on Constantinople with thirty thousand troops, only to be decisively defeated by his father [Root.Monarch.GetName], who personally led forty thousand men, forcing Selim to flee to the Black Sea.\n\nEmboldened by victory, [Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned his eldest son to the capital. He was secretly brought into the palace at night, preparing to ascend the throne as a fait accompli. Believing himself secure, he indulged in pleasure, music, and wine, earning the complete disdain of the Kapikulu. They presented [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a petition submitted through the Sublime Porte, demanding the expulsion from the city of state officials who supported his eldest son and ordering the prince to return to his original post, under threat of severe action. Left with no choice, he could only return to Anatolia, where he could gather additional troops locally. It was out of deep disappointment and anger that this eldest son of [Root.Monarch.GetName] committed an error even graver than Selim's: he besieged and seized Konya by force.\n\nThis utterly foolish act placed him in the position of a rebellious son. Selim's supporters in Constantinople exploited this to the fullest, using the charge of treason to compel [Root.Monarch.GetName] to acknowledge the legitimacy of Selim's succession. Ultimately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was forced to withdraw his support for his foolish eldest son and summon Selim to Constantinople to assume the throne."

This move was intended as a significant step to further consolidate the empire's religious authority and unite its vast Muslim populace. Yet, unexpectedly, it was like a boulder cast into a still lake, sending ripples of doubt spreading far and wide.\n\nThe Ottoman Padishah's claim to the Caliphate aroused deep suspicion among Sunni believers both within and outside the empire. In their hearts, the succession of the Caliphate followed a strict and sacred lineage, and Selim I's sudden intervention shattered this traditional understanding. Some devout Sunni scholars viewed this acquisition of the title without orthodox approval as an open challenge to religious order. These murmurs of dissent began privately among the people and gradually coalesced into an undercurrent flowing through every corner of the empire.\n\nAnti-Ottoman forces, both domestic and foreign, who had long eyed the Ottoman Empire covetously, keenly seized this opportunity. Like sharks scenting blood, they began covertly inciting and exploiting popular discontent. Through various hidden channels, these forces spread negative discourse about the Ottoman Padishah's caliphal status, portraying Selim I as a usurper who defiled religious tradition, further exacerbating the already unstable situation.\n\nFinally, an event that seemed accidental yet almost inevitable became the trigger for the crisis. One day, a young Muslim child set himself ablaze before the Fatih Mosque, where Mehmed II the Conqueror lies buried, to express his dissatisfaction with the Caliph. This heart-wrenching scene instantly caused an uproar. Anti-Ottoman forces swiftly mobilized, spreading the word that this was the bitter fruit of the Ottoman Padishah's misguided religious policies, claiming that the illegitimate acquisition of the caliphal title had provoked divine wrath, leading to such misfortune befalling an innocent child.\n\nThe people's emotions were fully ignited, and a massive rebellion spread like wildfire. On city streets, angry crowds armed themselves, shouting slogans against the Ottoman Padishah.

Disguised, they moved through cities and villages, covertly meeting with local Shi'ite leaders. These emissaries brought seditious words, claiming that Ottoman rule over the Shi'ites was filled with injustice, and that only under the guidance of the Safavid Order could Shi'ites truly attain freedom and dignity.\n\nTo incite rebellion, the Safavid Order meticulously fabricated various rumors. They proclaimed that the Ottoman Padishah was about to launch large-scale persecution of Shi'ites, confiscating their property and destroying their mosques. These rumors spread like wildfire among the Shi'ite communities within the Ottoman Empire, constantly stoking fear and anger in the people's hearts."

An ambitious man named Hakim, hearing of the internal turmoil within the Ottoman Empire caused by the caliphal title, saw an opportunity. He declared he had found evidence of lineage from the Abbasid royal family, transforming himself into a self-proclaimed Abbasid Caliph.\n\nIn the Hejaz region near the Arabian Peninsula in the empire's south, home to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the religious atmosphere is thick. A man named Salih also declared himself an Abbasid Caliph. Exploiting the local populace's reverence for religious tradition, he accused the Ottoman Empire of mismanaging the holy sites, desecrating their sanctity. Salih addressed pilgrims in Mecca's markets and mosques, recounting the Ottoman rulers' 'crimes,' claiming only the restoration of the Abbasid Caliphate could truly uphold Islam's purity and dignity. He even produced so-called 'holy relics' as proof of his legitimate identity, deluding masses of devout followers. Soon, he gathered a large following. Armed with simple weapons, they launched a rebellion in the Hejaz, attacking Ottoman garrisons and administrative offices.\n\nIn parts of the Anatolian plateau in the empire's west, the rebel leader Karim likewise declared himself an Abbasid Caliph. Exploiting long-standing local grievances against the central government, he stirred up discontent with Ottoman rule. Karim organized an armed force, seizing towns and villages, establishing his own sphere of influence.

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.1.desc:0 "In this year's spring, the court at Namur finally regained its former order, yet the scent of blood and fire still lingered in the air. After long years, the banner of the Kingdom of Lotharingia once again flew above the walls of German cities. The citizens of the capital shouted the Queen's name in the squares, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood on the balcony, responding to the crowd's fervor with silence. 'After countless bloody rebellions and suppressions,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared to the royal court, 'we have finally achieved peace. The French nobility have repaid the kingdom's protection with loyalty, and the German princes have yielded under iron and blood.'\n\nYet, the glory of victory could not conceal underlying anxieties. Although German princes were arrested, tried, and slaughtered, and we stripped many German nobles of their titles, we lacked the strength to fully confiscate their lands. German castles were captured, rebel armies dispersed, and their leaders met their end on the execution grounds—but their lands remained under German control. According to old inheritance laws, the sons, nephews, and even distant relatives of these deposed princes inherited their estates—in short, German territories were still ruled by other German nobles.\n\nMoreover, the Holy Roman Empire and our enemies continued to fund these German nobles. Their lands and the people upon them remained German. We defeated the German nobles' armies but could not eradicate their influence. Germans still spoke German, retained their customs and festivals, and listened to preachers from the Holy Roman Empire. They superficially acknowledged Lotharingian rule but inwardly placed their hopes in Augsburg, Nuremberg, or even Vienna. We have reason to believe these Germans will not abandon opposition, especially Duke Gerhard of Jülich-Berg, that stubborn duke who gathered forces in Cologne and allied with the Archbishop of Cologne—he remains the greatest threat. The kingdom's spies report he secretly meets with imperial envoys, receives gold and silver from east of the Rhine to train new mercenaries.\n\n'We defeated their armies but failed to destroy their foundations. The German heart of this land still beats for revenge.' Yet, peace remains a hard-won gift. The streets of Namur bustle again, merchants come and go, and French nobles pledge loyalty at court banquets. Princess Bernadette receives the most rigorous education in the palace, learning French and German, studying history and military strategy. Courtiers whisper that this young heir possesses her father's courage and her mother's wisdom. 'Once she comes of age,' the Regent told his closest advisor under cover of night, 'Lotharingia will surely regain greatness under her leadership.'\n\nOn the banks of the Rhine to the north, church bells still toll for another faith. Peace is but a brief calm before the next storm."

Initially, some French nobles stirred uneasily but did not cause major waves; what truly plunged the Kingdom of Lotharingia into crisis were the German princes from the east. The Kingdom of Lotharingia straddles the Franco-German border on the map, and its rule over German territories was never secure. German princes constantly yearned to return to the Holy Roman Empire. While Louis VII still lived, though German princes derisively called him 'the Beggar King,' they could not ignore his military prowess and genius. Faced with Louis's centralizing reforms, they could only remain silent. But after his death, the German princes immediately sensed opportunity and began planning to pressure the Regency Council to restore, even expand, local privileges. This process would inevitably be gradual, and the German princes would certainly continue to demand more powers in the future."

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.3.desc:0 "In the second winter after the death of Louis VII, the cold winds of the Kingdom of Lotharingia swept not only the hills between the Rhine and the Moselle but also the long corridors of the royal palace. The young Queen Bernadette remained secluded deep within the court, with the Regency Council handling affairs of state. Yet disagreements among the council members deepened daily, especially concerning matters in the German regions, where tension had reached a boiling point.\n\nIn early spring of that year, Archbishop Gerhard of Cologne and Archbishop Anselm of Trier arrived together in Metz, accompanied by dozens of clergy in purple robes and abbots. They entered the royal city in a grand procession, not to celebrate the new year, but to deliver a weighty joint petition. Written in solemn Latin, the petition stated their demand: 'The Church in the German regions shall have its autonomy and independence, free from intervention by royal secular affairs.'\n\nArchbishop Gerhard proclaimed in the council hall: 'Her Majesty is young, and governance is in your hands, but matters of God should be managed by God's people. The German Church should adjudicate its own canons, appoint its bishops, and manage its properties without sending every matter to Metz for approval.' His words struck the councilors like a hammer. Supporters were mainly German princes and some nobles sympathetic to the Church, who believed this would relieve the kingdom's financial burden and secure the Church's pacifying influence in the regions. However, opponents looked further ahead—granting the German Church full autonomy would mean recognizing a parallel power structure within the kingdom, one that could, with the support of German princes, challenge royal authority in turn.\n\nArchbishop Anselm of Trier was more blunt: 'The kingdom's territory is vast, and German believers are numerous. If every matter of marriage, inheritance, and land must cross the Rhine to Metz, will this not hinder the people's livelihood? Her Majesty is young; we are willing to use the Church's strength to safeguard stability in Germany until the day she assumes personal rule.' He uttered the word 'safeguard' with profound implication.\n\nThe Regency Council debated for three days. The French-born nobles adamantly opposed, calling this a precursor to weakening central authority; some neutral counts hesitated, fearing that refusal might prompt the Church to incite believers against the court. Meanwhile, in German monasteries and cathedrals, priests hinted from the pulpits that the nobles of Metz cared not for their souls.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, news arrived from the streets of Metz—in Cologne and Trier, groups of people began gathering around royal outposts, shouting 'Let our shepherds be free.' Though these gatherings were not yet violent, they made the Regency Council sense a rising undercurrent."

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.4.desc:0 "In the second year after Louis VII's death, the power struggle within the Kingdom of Lotharingia had shifted from surging undercurrents to open confrontation. In the palace at Namur, the Regent [Root.Monarch.GetName] faced an extremely thorny issue: how to weaken the nearly untouchable privileges of the German princes without utterly enraging them. Since the time of Charlemagne, German and Frankish nobles had enjoyed an ancient privilege known as the 'Right of Noble Inviolability.' According to this tradition, the monarch could not arbitrarily arrest nobles, much less subject them to torture or forced confession. Even if accused of grave crimes like rebellion or treason, they had to be tried by a special court composed of peers of equal rank. This system functioned during the unified empire era, but in the current state of division and opposition, it became a shackle for the central government.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stated frankly in the council: 'Gentlemen, the kingdom's enemies do not always wear foreign banners; sometimes they sit beside us. If they are cloaked in noble titles, they become immune to prosecution. This is not only an insult to royal authority but a wound to the kingdom.' Upon hearing this, French-born bishops and counts agreed, believing this privilege should be revoked or at least weakened to effectively sanction rebellious German nobles.\n\nHowever, once the news reached the Rhine, the German princes formed a united front almost overnight. Gerhard of Jülich-Berg gathered princes and archbishops in Cologne's cathedral, proclaiming to the assembled audience: 'Since Charlemagne, our honor and freedom were granted by God and the sword, not to be taken away by the Namur council! Today they abolish our inviolability, tomorrow they can imprison us at will, using torture to force our submission. Germany must never agree!' The Archbishop of Cologne even hinted during mass: 'A kingdom that cannot even protect its nobles will eventually strip away your freedoms as well.' Such rhetoric quickly spread in Aachen, Trier, Mainz, and beyond, even printed on pamphlets distributed in markets and taverns. To demonstrate their stance, the German princes signed a 'German Noble Charter of Liberties' in Cologne, vowing that if any noble were arrested on royal orders, other princes would assemble armed forces to forcibly rescue them. Guilds in Aachen even proposed funding mercenaries to prevent Namur from sending troops into German territories to enforce arrest warrants."

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.5.desc:0 "During the lifetime of Louis VII, facing frequent border conflicts and princely power struggles in the German regions, he had to compromise—exempting the German nobility from military service obligations in exchange for their limited support during wartime. While this stabilized the situation east of the Rhine in the short term, it sowed the seeds for the weakening of royal authority. After the king's death and the young Bernadette's succession, this privilege gradually became a protective talisman for the German princes. They neither provided troops to support the kingdom's campaigns nor obeyed Namur's orders. Instead, they secretly amassed strength and maintained frequent contact with foreign powers. The royal treasurer lamented in council meetings: 'The German princes do not fulfill their military obligations yet continue to enjoy the kingdom's protection and trade privileges. This amounts to using our wealth to strengthen their rebellious power.'\n\n'The kingdom cannot nurture a tiger that will turn on us. If military obligations are not restored, we will never control the Rhine's throat nor be able to punish the rebels.' Thus, the court announced it would formally propose abolishing the German nobility's military exemption at the next royal parliament. When the news reached Cologne, Gerhard of Jülich-Berg was furious. Summoning German princes and bishops to Cologne Castle, he proclaimed: 'The Lotharingian court seeks to make us serve in their armies like peasants. This is an insult to our ancestors' honor! Our swords should be raised for Germany, not shed blood for Namur's regent.' The Archbishop of Cologne then hinted from the pulpit of the Cathedral: 'Those who seek to take away our freedom act against God's will.'"

At this time, the most difficult situation came from the cities—those commercial centers that should have relied on royal protection began openly demanding the weakening of central authority. The situation in Cologne had long slipped from the court's control under the manipulation of Duke Gerhard of Jülich-Berg. Allied with the subservient Archbishop, he had established a de facto autonomous power center in the Lower Rhine. Influenced by this, guilds and merchant associations in major German cities gradually realized that freeing themselves from Namur's tariffs and commercial regulations would yield greater profits and freer trade.\n\nIn the spring of $YEAR$, representatives from the merchant associations of Aachen, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Lübeck, and other cities gathered in Cologne, convened for a 'Trade Freedom Assembly' secretly arranged by Gerhard. At the meeting, the representative from Aachen—a cloth merchant named Konrad von Brühl—presented a strongly worded petition demanding the royal court grant tax exemption privileges to German commercial cities. The petition stated: 'German gold should not be devoured by Namur's endless tax collectors. Our markets should serve our citizens, not a distant court.'\n\nKonrad declared bluntly in his speech: 'Our guild's wagons must pay seven different tolls along the way from Aachen to the heart of Wallonia. The king is dead, the new queen is young—why should we still fund the banquets and hunts of unfamiliar nobles? Tax exemption is not a request but a right.' His words immediately drew cheers from the assembly. Soon after, Aachen witnessed the largest citizen gathering in its history. Thousands of artisans, merchants, and apprentices gathered before the town hall, waving banners inscribed with 'Tax Exemption is Freedom,' demanding the city council immediately submit the petition to Namur. The gathering lasted three full days; the town hall bells tolled through the nights, as if announcing to all Germany that a new autonomy movement had begun.\n\nWhen the petition reached Namur, the atmosphere in the palace council chamber was grave. The French-born nobles unanimously considered this an open provocation to royal authority; granting it would mean losing the last vestiges of control over the German economy. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] understood well that refusal would allow Gerhard to exploit discontent, pushing more cities into the rebel camp."

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.7.desc:0 "Pressure from the eastern German regions is intensifying, especially from the defiant Duke of Berg, Gerhard of Jülich-Berg, who has become the standard-bearer against central authority. Gerhard has proposed yet another bill demanding that all judicial powers in the German regions be held jointly by local princes and the Church, with the royal court forbidden from sending judges, interfering in trials, or requesting reviews of verdicts.\n\nGerhard stated bluntly at the meeting: 'We do not oppose the crown in Namur, but the crown must acknowledge—German law belongs to the Germans. Foreign judges, ignorant of our customs and our honor, only adjudicate cases for the benefit of Metz and Namur. This humiliation must end.' The Archbishop of Cologne promptly echoed: 'God's law and local law are equally sacred, not to be touched by worldly, greedy hands.'\n\nWeeks later, a German delegation entered the royal council chamber at Namur carrying these 'Judicial Autonomy Articles.' Spring sunlight streamed through high windows onto the long table, illuminating the neatly and coldly written text—not only demanding the court relinquish interference in German justice but also stipulating that royal officials could not engage in any legal affairs in German territories, with violators considered infringers of territorial rights. Within the council, the French-born nobles were incensed. The Marquis of Chambéry pounded the table: 'This clearly turns Germany into an independent kingdom!' The Bishop of Metz was more direct: 'If this passes, the court will have not an inch of authority left in the east.'\n\nThe news quickly spread through German cities. Pamphlets supporting judicial autonomy appeared in town squares, and guilds and merchant associations publicly declared that local adjudication would save time and money while avoiding corruption and bias from royal judges. Some cities even began refusing to cooperate with judicial envoys sent by the court, forcing them to turn back at the gates. Rejecting the articles could trigger a united rebellion by German princes; accepting them would sever the kingdom's nerves with our own hands. Under Namur's night sky, the palace lights burned through the night as the Regent and the council argued endlessly at the long table—while far on the Rhine's banks, Gerhard of Jülich-Berg was already planning his next move to spread the flames of judicial autonomy to even wider domains."

The young Queen Bernadette resided in the palace at Namur, while true power lay with the Regent and the Royal Council. Yet, the German princes from the east did not subside with time; on the contrary, their demands grew more direct and radical.\n\nIn early spring of this year, more than ten German counts and representatives of free cities secretly gathered in Mainz on the banks of the Rhine. At the meeting, Duke Gerhard of Jülich-Berg of Cologne first proposed a bold motion—the 'Charter of Liberties.' This charter proclaimed that the actions of the German nobility should be completely independent of royal oversight; they had the right to 'freely enter and leave the realm and engage with any foreign power without prior notice or permission.'\n\n'We are pillars of the empire, not prisoners on a chain. If even visiting allied states or meeting merchants requires Namur's consent, where then is German honor?' His words met with widespread agreement. The Archbishop of Cologne added: 'Church envoys traveling between Rome and Vienna should not be hindered by secular authority. The "Charter of Liberties" is not only for noble freedom but also for freedom of faith.' The charter was soon sent to Namur and formally presented in the Royal Council by a German delegation. Within the palace's marble hall, the atmosphere tensed instantly. Supporters argued this would promote trade and cultural exchange with neighboring states, even bringing more diplomatic space to the kingdom. Opponents angrily denounced it as paving the way for princes to ally with foreign powers and betray royal authority.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stated gravely: 'Gentlemen, the kingdom's borders are broad but not meaningless. If nobles' movements are entirely unconstrained, royal authority will become a shadow, and border defenses will exist in name only.' However, the German delegates did not relent. Duke Gerhard retorted coldly: 'What is a shadow is royal authority; what is real is our land and swords.'\n\nWhen news spread, slogans supporting the 'Charter of Liberties' swiftly appeared in German towns. Along the Rhine markets, merchants and travelers openly discussed the court's 'tyranny.' In Cologne and Trier, cathedral bells tolled especially long on Sundays, hinting at support for the charter. To exert pressure, the German princes even declared that if the court rejected the 'Charter of Liberties,' they would collectively refuse to pay this year's tariffs and military contributions to Namur. This immediately caused fiscal shock—eastern tariff revenues for Lotharingia plummeted by thirty percent within two months. Under Namur's night sky, candlelight burned late in the regency council as debate over the 'Charter of Liberties' continued. The kingdom's future seemed suspended above the Rhine's waters—any ripple could be swallowed by the torrent of division."

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.9.desc:0 "Cologne—this wealthy city on the banks of the Rhine, though most of its surrounding lands are firmly held by the royal court, the city itself and the Archbishop's power are tightly gripped by Duke Wilhelm of Berg. Amid Lotharingia's current chaos, Duke Gerhard of Berg quietly fomented a political storm. He secretly urged the Archbishop to subtly and frequently mention 'the freedom God grants the city' from the pulpit, while the Duke himself, through guilds, merchant associations, and the city council, constantly propagated the narrative of the court 'exploiting Cologne's wealth,' stoking popular discontent.\n\nSoon, the first spontaneous gatherings of citizens appeared on Cologne's streets—they held wooden signs inscribed with 'Cologne's gold should stay in Cologne,' demanding reductions in taxes paid to the royal court. Initially, just dozens gathered shouting before the town hall, but funded by Duke Berg, artisans, merchants, and even some mercenaries joined their ranks, swelling the procession day by day. The Archbishop, in the Church's name, provided safe spaces for these gatherings, even training militia at monasteries outside the city. Duke Berg secretly sent signals to neighboring princes—if Cologne could break from Lotharingia, it would become the banner of the German autonomy movement, grandly declaring: 'From this day forth, Cologne shall manage its own affairs, free from Lotharingian interference. Our oath is to guard this land and the purity of our faith until freedom is secure.'\n\nDeafening cheers erupted in the squares, and bells echoed long along the Rhine. The news spread like wind through the German states.

EDG_LOT_War_of_Succession.10.desc:0 "The Paladin, its root derived from Palatinus. Palatinus means 'belonging to the Palatine Hill.' In ancient Roman times, this Latin word referred to high-ranking nobles associated with the Palatine Hill. As this hill was the site of the Roman imperial palace, Palatinus was also commonly used to denote courtiers who served the Roman Emperor and handled military and administrative affairs. Entering the Middle Ages, Charlemagne's twelve most distinguished knights were called the Twelve Peers, meaning 'the twelve close attendants,' indicating they were the Emperor's trusted inner circle. In the later Carolingian period, especially within the Kingdom of Lotharingia, the number of 'Paladins' expanded significantly. It was no longer limited to twelve individuals nor merely a term for powerful ministers, but became an organization akin to a knightly order. The title of 'Paladin' was bestowed by Carolingian monarchs and required ecclesiastical recognition; thus, Paladins were both military nobility and clergy—though debate over whether Paladins should adhere to celibacy never ceased. The selection criteria for Paladins were stringent: recipients had to be nobles, undergo rigorous military training and religious study, and maintain loyalty to the royal house—precisely why Paladins became a powerful and reliable force within our realm. In the year $YEAR$, as [Root.GetName] faced a disastrous predicament, the loyal Paladins proposed to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that they could provide support to help resolve the current crisis."

Indeed, Wilhelm used his wit and generosity to weave an invisible net, ensnaring those radical French faction nobles one by one. His words were like honey, yet like strong wine, making opponents lose composure, even willing to set aside hatred temporarily to jointly guard this fractured kingdom. Among the French faction nobles, some adamantly opposed his presence.

He did not boast of achievements nor posture as a hero, simply standing with hands clasped behind his back, waiting quietly. Firelight from the hearth reflected on his armor, the subdued gold hues not from courtly luxury but from the dust and snow of campaigns thousands of miles away. 'You are already a pillar of the kingdom,' the Queen said gently. 'Why venture into military authority?'\n\nWilhelm bowed his head slightly, his tone mild yet firm. 'Your Majesty, I seek not power. My lifelong wish is to carve another stable path for the kingdom, beyond my father's shadow. The northern blizzards and border flames—I have seen them with my own eyes. If one day enemies cross the Rhine, I wish to be the first to stand before them—not for myself, but for Your Majesty's crown, for the lights of [Root.Capital.GetName].'\n\nHe did not speak of German tributes, nor of noble support, merely spread one hand gently over the map, his fingertip resting on the dotted border line. 'Here, if defense hesitates for a moment, the entire realm falls into peril.

She saw no greed, no ambition, not even the sharpness of self-important pride. Wilhelm's demeanor was like a stone weathered yet unchanged—steady, solid, yet not overbearing. Outside the window, evening bells tolled in the dusk, their deep echoes seeming to bear witness to this dialogue. Bernadette nodded slowly, her tone carrying a rare softness: 'Duke Wilhelm, if I entrust the armies to you, will you swear to me that the sword's edge shall never stray from the crown and the kingdom?'\n\nWilhelm knelt on one knee, right hand on his sword, forehead lightly touching the hilt. 'I swear upon my life.'"

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.15.desc:0 "Queen Bernadette stood upon the high dais, her gaze fixed on the ancient oak coffin. She remembered Gerhard's laughter, that gentle yet sharp humor, and his composed replies in court. Now, all that had fallen silent. Soon, the court welcomed a new face—Wilhelm, Gerhard's only son, merely twenty-seven, yet inheriting his father's title and estates. In his features rested a shadow of his father's steadiness, yet with an added sharpness unique to youth.\n\nOne morning in the palace corridors, Wilhelm presented a memorial to the Queen. He bowed respectfully, his voice calm and clear: 'Your Majesty, I wish to serve the kingdom. If you permit, I am willing to take up the position of Minister of Finance.'\n\nBernadette looked up at him, her eyes containing both doubt and scrutiny. 'Wilhelm,' she said slowly, 'managing finances... that is the lifeblood of the entire kingdom. Do you know its difficulty?'\n\nWilhelm did not answer immediately. He unfurled the memorial, which held not empty promises but pages dense with accounts and tax charts—port tariff rates, border trade, grain reserves, minting costs. He pointed to one entry: 'Your Majesty, this is the tax levied on German merchant convoys at northern ports last winter when southern grain prices rose. If we adjust the tariffs, we can balance prices and increase treasury reserves.'\n\nHis tone was not urgent, even carrying a note of caution. 'I have no intention to amass wealth; I only wish, beyond my father's shadow, to open another stable path for the kingdom.' At the corridor's end, sunlight filtered through stained glass, falling on Wilhelm's profile. In that moment, Bernadette seemed to see a young man with simple aspirations.\n\nShe did not agree immediately, nor did she refuse, only weighing silently in her heart. Outside, the bells tolled once more, as if reminding her: one era has ended, another is knocking at the door."

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.16.desc:0 "The gray skies of [Root.Capital.GetName] gradually cleared, the wind carrying a long-absent warmth. Yet this warmth came not from a gentle spring sun but from the hidden flames of shifting power. Duke Wilhelm of Jülich-Berg quietly expanded his influence within the heart of this ancient kingdom, like a black steed galloping across the German lands, unimpeded. With his tactics and wisdom, he compelled the complex German princes to submit to royal authority, temporarily smoothing the kingdom's fractures. He appeared so loyal, requesting to share the Queen's burdens, willing to charge northward on horseback or immerse himself in financial management, yet claiming he merely wished to atone for his father's sins.\n\nThe shadows of past German rebellion now seemed like mist slowly dispersed by the sunlight of time. Under Wilhelm's coordination, tribute from Germany flowed steadily into the treasury; wealth converged like rivers into the deep wells of the court, nourishing the precarious foundation of royal authority. Former rebels became pillars of the crown; past resistance turned into hymns of obedience.\n\nAt least on the surface, it seemed so.\n\nBernadette gazed at the gradually golden horizon beyond the window, her heart swirling with complex emotions—trust in Wilhelm, yet foreboding for the future. Lotharingia's fate was firmly held in this German duke's hands, a path that could lead to light or slip into an abyss. Deep within, she had been waiting for Wilhelm to rebel... or to reach out and demand more power. Yet Wilhelm consistently performed only his duties.\n\nAll this led Bernadette to question: should she truly judge a son based on his father's deeds? Gerhard was an opponent, but Wilhelm was not Gerhard. She went to the chapel to pray, contemplating during her prayers.\n\nShe prayed and prayed, thought and thought, questioning herself over and over, as candles for illumination extinguished one by one.\n\nWhen her all-night vigil ended, the son was not the father. Wilhelm was not Gerhard."

In the corridors of the council hall, the final minister's footsteps faded beyond the stone archway, the heavy oak doors slowly closing. Only the Queen and Wilhelm remained within the chamber. The winter sunset filtered through high windows, staining the marble floor crimson and illuminating the faintly floating dust in the air. Wilhelm did not speak immediately; his breath seemed to vie with his heartbeat for rhythm. As Bernadette was about to rise, he suddenly stepped forward, kneeling on one knee.\n\n'Your Majesty,' his voice was low and steady, yet carrying an unavoidable tremor, 'I have something to say... I cannot hold it back any longer.'\nBernadette slightly frowned, signaling him to continue.\n\n'On the day of your wedding to Prince Carle, I was present.' His eyes flickered in the interplay of light and shadow. 'In that moment, seeing you was like witnessing the first ray of spring sunlight upon snow—suddenly bright, impossible to look away.'\nBernadette remained silent, her fingers lightly tapping the armrest of her chair.\n'During the days in Aachen,' Wilhelm continued, 'whether at grand balls or in the palace gardens, I always watched you from afar. I remember every piece played at concerts, every word you whispered to your ladies-in-waiting. Even then, I knew—I had fallen hopelessly in love with you.'\nHis tone was not hurried, but like slowly unsealing a letter long locked away.\n'Upon returning to Berg's domains, I thought time would wear away this sentiment, yet... every time I close my eyes, I still see your smile by candlelight. However, my father—Duke Gerhard—always opposed the Lotharingian court. And you already had a royal consort. Therefore, I dared not, could not, voice this emotion.'\nHe paused, as if overcoming a final hesitation.\n'But... forgive my impertinence, after Carle's disappearance, I suddenly saw hope. After my father's death, I eagerly distanced myself from his legacy, pledging loyalty to you—not just for my family's sake, but to... draw one step closer to you. I do not know if you trust me, but I no longer wish to wait. I would rather be rejected now than spend a lifetime in silence.'\n\nOutside the hall, the low tolling of evening bells slowly arrived, like destiny echoing from afar. Bernadette looked upon the young duke kneeling before her; his eyes held none of his father's calculations, only a fiercely burning light."

The council had long dispersed; only Wilhelm and Bernadette remained facing each other. Wilhelm still knelt on one knee, head slightly raised, eyes burning with a light not meant for a subject. 'Bernadette,' he spoke low and hurriedly, 'what I say now may be arrogance, may be blasphemy, but I can remain silent no longer. I love you—not a vassal's reverence for a sovereign, but a man's love for a woman.'\n\nBernadette's brow furrowed slightly, yet she did not speak.\n\n'My love for you is not a fleeting impulse but a prolonged torment. Since first seeing you in the court of [Root.Capital.GetName], I felt—you are not merely a queen, but the only light in my heart. You are the hearth-fire in winter, the harbor in a gale.'\n\nWilhelm slowly rose, stepping closer, his voice low and firm: 'Gerhard's death gave me my only freedom. I need no longer bear my father's grudges, no longer oppose the court. I cast everything aside solely to draw near to you.' He paused, his gaze locked on her. 'Bernadette, I no longer wish to be merely your subject. I want to be your companion, your husband.'\n\nBernadette's lips moved slightly as if to refuse, but Wilhelm suddenly reached out, cradling her fingers, pressing them almost pleadingly to his lips. 'Let go of Carle,' his voice seemed wrenched from the depths of his chest. 'That marriage was a political shackle, not a bond of hearts. He could not give you ardor, companionship, understanding... these, I am willing to give. I would trade my entire family, my whole life, even all of Germany, for your love.'\n\nBernadette withdrew her hand, walking toward the window. Outside, night lay heavy; the lights of [Root.Capital.GetName] flickered in the mist like countless faint stars. She looked toward the starry sky, yet saw not stars, but her sons—young Louis, and Gabriel—and their father, her husband, Carle. She stood with her back to Wilhelm, shoulders trembling faintly, offering no reply.\n\n'Bernadette,' Wilhelm's voice came from behind, nearly obstinate, 'promise me, be my wife. I will be your shield and your sword. Whether against foreign threats or court undercurrents, I will stand before you. I ask for nothing else, only that you grant this humble man an answer.'"

Gabriel was as handsome as his father, though not as robust and valiant as Carle, he had shown promise in several jousting tournaments.\n\nMother and son enjoyed each other's company until a dust-covered knight stumbled into the council chamber, insisting on delivering a letter personally to Bernadette immediately.\n\n'Your Majesty...' He knelt on the floor, clutching a letter stained with dark brown spots. The blood had long dried yet still exuded a rusty scent.\n\nTaking the letter, a strange chill ran through Bernadette as her fingertips touched the coagulated bloodstains. Opening the envelope, she was utterly shocked the moment she saw the handwriting—it was her beloved's script, the writing she knew best:\n\n'Bernadette,\nI am alive. Forgive me for not writing all these years and not revealing my whereabouts. After our last defeat at Jerusalem, we withdrew our forces to Cyprus, recuperating in secret and continuing recruitment. The work we undertake is immensely difficult; we must secretly contact soldiers and organize old troops on enemy soil, not letting a single whisper escape.\nMy wounds have healed, but my heart has not cooled. I have recalled my veterans and allied with the Lusignans of Cyprus, who will raise their swords for me. Soon, I can gather a force of elite troops and march on Jerusalem once more.\nWithin the city, I have found an ally—Zaid, who claims to be a prince of the Sahada dynasty. You may not have heard his name, but between Persia and the Two Rivers, he is a feared mercenary king. He is a kind-hearted man, having witnessed the people's hardships, and is friendly towards Christians and the poor. Zaid is willing to assist me in capturing Jerusalem, even agreeing to let us establish the Kingdom of Jerusalem, demanding only to personally slay the Governor of Jerusalem—a Mamluk of the Bahri family, said to have personally concocted the poison that killed Sultan Safar of Sahada. He says his life is nearing its end, with only this wish remaining. Recently, he was hired by the governor to guard Jerusalem. Though he commands only a few hundred men, it is enough to aid me. We have devised a plan, striking from within and without, to take Jerusalem.\nI have been away from home for ten years, but I will return soon. My love, wait for me, wait for my triumphant return—\nYour Carle'\n\nThe ink at the letter's end was smeared by blood, the final words almost blurred into dark shadows.\n\nUpon finishing, tears streamed down Bernadette's face. Gabriel also took the letter, then wept, and mother and son embraced in tears."

The news he brought silenced everyone in the court.\n\nIt was reported that days ago, the Frankish leader Carle led an army landing at Gaza. His forces numbered over ten thousand, including Franks from Western Europe, Italians, Greeks, and even remnants of Crusader refugees from North Africa. Their covert preparations were executed with terrifying efficiency; we had no idea such a massive army was gathering in Cyprus. Their intelligence work was equally astounding—they learned in advance that our fleet was dispatched westward, struck Gaza under cover of night, and received aid from local Alawites, making their operation swift and secret.\n\nThe Governor of Quds had previously hired a mercenary leader named Abbas from Persia to guard the western city, but we now know this man is Zaid, a prince of the Sahada dynasty. Zaid rose from within the city, joining forces with the external army, ultimately leading to the fall of Jerusalem.\n\nAfter the city fell, Zaid captured the Governor of Quds. This man, an officer of the Mamluk under the Bahri family, was said to have personally poisoned Safar's medicine, leading to the death of Sahada's Malik—Safar. Zaid conducted no trial, directly administering punishment. According to witnesses, the governor's fingers and toes were severed joint by joint, followed by dismemberment of his limbs; hot oil was poured over the wounds, causing unbearable agony. Afterwards, Zaid commanded that he be flayed alive until death, and finally executed by impalement. His corpse was hung upon the gates of Quds, displayed to all who passed.\n\nOn the day of the assault, the Christian populace within the city shouted with joy in the streets, and the church bells rang without ceasing day and night. The Lusignan family of Cyprus immediately pressed their claim before Carle, declaring that by covenant and bloodline they were rightful heirs to the throne of Quds."

She opened it; the paper still held the saltiness of sea air and the dust of harbors. Carle's handwriting remained steady, the strokes exuding a warrior's confidence:\n\n'Bernadette,\nBy the time you read this letter, I shall have left the dust and bloodstains of Jerusalem, boarding a ship anchored in Gaza. The Syrian coast fades behind me, seagulls circling above the masts. Within days, I will arrive at [Root.Capital.GetName].\nI know that going and returning has placed years between us. But now, I return with victory. Jerusalem has been taken by me and Zaid—as for Zaid, I did not know he was so clear in love and hate; he is truly good to the poor, yet I do not know why he enjoys tormenting his enemies so much. It seems because his wish is fulfilled; before I left, Zaid was already bedridden. As for the Cypriots, they demanded the throne, and I—I only wish to see you.\nI do not know what storms you weathered in my absence, nor whether, in those long nights, you thought of me. Bernadette, I am returning—not as a fugitive, but as a conqueror returning to claim the city. Wait for me, stand on the palace steps and wait—I am coming soon.'\n\nBernadette slowly set the letter down, her eyes gleaming with indistinguishable emotion.

As Bernadette's gaze swept over Wilhelm, it paused briefly—a moment that seemed both assessment and silent provocation.\n\n'Gentlemen,' the Queen's voice rang clearly throughout the hall, 'thank you for answering the call. Today's tournament concerns not only my marriage but also the kingdom's future honor.'\n\n'Look at her—she seems to be choosing a knight, not a husband.' Wilhelm jeered mockingly to those beside him.\n\nThe Queen ordered attendants to bring a chest of blunted swords, having all competitors draw lots.\n\nThe air in the hall was like a taut drumhead; light gleamed coldly on armor; the sound of iron boots on stone floor rolled nearer like distant thunder.\n\nAfter the draw, the German nobles took turns competing. The clash of wooden swords was crisp and heavy, like axes splitting wet timber; panting, shouts, and grating of armor echoed under the vaulted ceiling. Before the first round ended, half were eliminated, leaning against walls to retreat to corners, faces pale, armor drenched in sweat as if soaked by rain.\n\nWilhelm was the last to compete in the first round. He won cleanly, but the moment his sword fell, he knew—fighting like this, by the finals, the remaining men would be utterly exhausted, without strength to lift a blade.\n\nThus, he simply tossed the wooden sword aside, turning to face everyone, his voice cutting through the air like a blade:\n\n'Hey! All of you! What kind of contest is this? We'll be fighting until dark without settling a damn thing! If you have real skill, change to a method that decides instantly!' The crowd immediately erupted. Some laughed, some shouted 'Change!', some beat swords against shields, creating a deep rhythm. Seeing this, Wilhelm smiled smugly, raising his chin to shout at the Queen: 'Your Majesty! Don't have us play with sticks like children! Give us a true challenge! Let the strongest man step forward now, immediately, publicly!'\n\nThe Queen stood on the second-floor balcony, watching quietly. She raised a hand; all sound receded like a tide. She smiled slowly—a smile containing both playfulness and scrutiny: 'Since you wish to change the contest, let it be as you desire.' She gestured; two attendants carried forward an ancient longbow. The bow was dark old wood, like bone weathered by countless storms; its back carved with waves and a lion's head; the string taut as winter steel wire, seeming to emit a cold vibration at the slightest touch.\n\nThe Queen's fingers slowly traced the bow's back. 'This is my husband Carle's war bow, accompanying him in campaigns for ten years, never failing. Today, whoever can draw it—no matter who—I will give my hand and my crown to him.'\n\nThen, the Queen turned and left. The hall fell silent instantly; all eyes were riveted on that bow. It was like a slumbering dragon, waiting for someone to awaken it—and the price of awakening might be the throne, or a broken arm and shattered dignity."

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.31.desc:0 "Everyone took turns attempting to draw that old bow, one after another failing. The bowstring remained taut, mocking their futile efforts. Wilhelm watched closely from the side, observing each pair of hands, each movement, like a wolf lurking in shadows waiting for prey to falter. Yet he did not step forward immediately, instead leaning lazily against a pillar, letting others exhaust themselves.\n\nFinally, it was his turn. Wilhelm approached the bow, a provocative smile at his lips. He took a deep breath; muscles in his arms bulged; veins like snakes crawled up his forearms. Gritting his teeth, he poured all his strength into the bowstring. The bow trembled—yet it did not yield an inch. Wilhelm's smile froze, replaced by fury. He abruptly released the bow, almost flinging it like a weapon toward a corner of the hall, where it landed with a dull thud. He turned, stepping onto the dais like a field commander, his gaze sweeping the crowd, voice like thunder:\n\n'Don't you see?! They're toying with us!'\n\n'First swordplay, then archery, dragging on and on, never letting us decide an outcome! Do you truly believe this farce will choose the Queen's husband?'\n\n'They want to stall, to wear us down gradually, to let us grow old, to let the throne grow cold, to let Gabriel grow up, to let the crown await its master!'\n\nHis tone grew more urgent, pacing back and forth on the dais, gestures like issuing military orders.\n\n'This moment, now, is the opportunity! Not waiting until tomorrow, not waiting for the next event! Now, we can seize the initiative!'\n\n'To hell with these damn rules! Burn them, destroy them! Is that fire still in your hearts?! Are you still proud Germans? Why let a woman toy with you?!'\n\nHis voice boomed, as if revealing a secret: 'Did you notice? That little prince is not present... What is our Queen waiting for? She's merely waiting for her son to come of age, to grow up—to kill us all!'\n\n'Stop daydreaming! Today, we can give [Root.GetName] a new master! Today, we can take everything—the throne, glory, even her heart!'\n\n'Let's kill Gabriel!'\n\n'Kill him! Kill him!' the Germans shouted.\n\n'Let's seize the Queen!'\n\n'Seize the Queen!

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.31.a:0 "Suddenly, an arrow pierced Wilhelm's neck from behind."

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.32.title:0 "Carle"
EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.32.desc:0 "Wilhelm's voice still echoed in the hall's vaulted ceiling when the arrow coldly pierced his throat. The arrowhead protruded from the back of his neck, bearing dark red beads of blood like frozen dew, gleaming ominously in the firelight. His eyes widened, lips parted, but only choked, fractured gasps emerged; blood bubbled between his lips. He clutched his neck, fingers trembling on the shaft as if gripping a viper. Blood gushed between his fingers, splattering onto the emblem on his chest, staining it a stark black-red. He staggered two steps, fell to his knees, knees striking the stone floor with a dull thud, breathing rapidly like a dying beast. He tried to speak, but only broken sounds emerged—'Urgh—kgh—'—warm blood gushed from nostrils and mouth simultaneously, dripping down his chin. His eyes began to glaze over, pupils dilating as if seeking some final light. Wilhelm's body convulsed violently several times; hands flailed weakly in the air for two circles, then he collapsed onto the stone floor with a low impact sound. Blood snaked along the floor's crevices, touching the boot tip of a nearby man, who instinctively stepped back.\n\nUtter silence.\n\nAll turned toward the direction the arrow had come from—at the hall's shadowy end, a tall figure slowly emerged from the darkness. Cloaked heavily, a long hood concealed his face; from the start, he had lurked there like a stone. No one noticed him, no one heard his footsteps. The figure halted, raising a hand to lower the hood—yes, the one who shot Wilhelm was Carle. In his grasp was the old bow Wilhelm had angrily flung aside moments before. Everyone remembered: no one could draw it even slightly, yet now it rested quietly in Carle's hand, the string still trembling faintly, as if savoring the fatal shot. Carle's gaze was like cold iron, yet his voice low and clear, reverberating in the silent hall:\n\n'For the past fifteen years, I waged holy war in a distant world, fulfilling Christ's will, yet endless pain and sorrow tormented me.'\n'My comrades fell, my spirit broke, my body endured ruin—yet I believed all I did was worthwhile, not only for God, but for my family.'\n'But when I again beheld my lands with my own eyes, I found my palace defiled, as ruined as Jerusalem, and most intolerable—I found you preparing to harm my son and violate my wife!'\n\nCarle's gaze blazed like fire, moving from tranquil sorrow toward towering wrath:\n\n'In Jerusalem, I befriended a comrade who told me his people's saying: Mercy is the most dangerous poison—I have endured enough. And you, all of you—'\n\nHe raised the bow, another arrow already nocked on the string, his eyes cold as a judge's:"

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.33.title:0 "The King of Lotharingia"
EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.33.desc:0 "As Carle's last syllable fell, the bowstring snapped violently. The first arrow shot forth like thunder, piercing the nearest German's eye socket; the arrowhead flew out the back of the skull, spraying white and red matter, embedding a piece of cranial bone in a stone pillar, the man hanging there like a nailed bat.\n\nHe did not stop. His left hand moved swift as wind; bowstring trembled in rapid succession, arrows tracing blazing white trajectories. One man's throat was pierced, blood mist spraying onto nearby faces, hot as oil splattering from an iron pan; another took an arrow to the abdomen, intestines gushing from the wound, spilling to the ground, tripping him as he stepped on them; yet another had tendons in both knees severed by arrows, kneeling just as another arrow pierced through his chin into the mouth, bursting through the crown of his skull, pinning him to the ceiling.\n\nWithin a few breaths, over a dozen had become a mountain of corpses. Carle's steps were steady as a great beast's, each stride splashing a bloody blossom.\n\n'Kill him! If we don't kill him, none of us will live!' someone shouted. The remaining men swiftly acted—some prepared to charge bare-handed, those who could grabbed blunted swords, others seized any weapon they could find.\n\nSuddenly, Carle raised his bow, shooting out the ropes of the hall's only light sources—the four chandeliers—one after another. The chandeliers fell into the pools below; all flames extinguished instantly, plunging the entire hall into darkness.\n\nSome nobles panicked and fled, only to find the main doors already locked; others raised their blunted swords, charging Carle, hoping to fight desperately for a sliver of life. He dropped the bow, drawing two longswords—each a two-handed weapon, yet one in each hand sufficed—blades notched from long holy war but reflecting lethal light in the gloom. Sword light flashed; the two nearest had their upper torsos cleanly sheared off, remaining lower halves collapsing in the bloody water, exhaling their last breath. Another raised a weapon to counter; Carle backhanded his arm off, the blade following through into shoulder and neck, cleaving him open from collarbone to rib, steaming lungs tumbling into the air.\n\nCarle was like a lion king charging into a flock of sheep—his swordwork held no flourish, only weight, precision, and ruin. One was pinned to a wall by his blade, body twitching as blood streamed down stone crevices like a brook; another had his head seized, neck brutally twisted, cervical bones cracking clearly in the silence like thunder. A young rebel attempted a flanking attack; Carle caught his wrist backhandedly, drove a sword into his belly, then slowly angled upward until the man was split open from abdomen to collarbone, entrails pouring forth like filthy water, carrying a choking sweetness of blood.\n\nThe stench of blood permeated the hall; the air grew heavy as if congealed. The remaining rebels trembled, struggling to their feet from the floor. One German noble, stumbling, treading on fallen comrades' blood, slowly climbed the dais. Clenching his fist, pale yet resolute with entreaty, he raised his arm and cried out: 'Our King! You have slain our leader, severed the serpent's head. We are merely a rabble, we pose no threat—we beg you to spare us, let no more Lotharingian blood flow. Let us leave, we shall be utterly loyal to you!—'"

EDG_LOT_disaster_marriage.34.desc:0 "A deathly silence filled the hall, only his voice echoing, as if its reverberations were heard by countless souls in the abyss of time. Carle softly uttered a single word, his voice low and cold, like the first crack of melting ice: 'No.' Just behind that noble, darkness surged like a tide. Carle appeared soundlessly; the keen blade fell mercilessly upon the noble's neck. Crimson blood gushed like a fountain; under the violent strike, the head was severed, blood splattering in all directions as it flew off, striking the stone wall of the hall with a heavy thud, spraying dark red spots. In that instant of bloody spray, time seemed to freeze; a chilling wind swept through the hearts of those present.\n\nCarle's gaze was cold and severe, watching his remaining enemies in the darkness. His sword moved like thunder, cleaving the darkness ahead.\n\nThe sound of clashing blades rose and fell; sharp steel gleamed in the firelight, severing the lifelines of those who sought escape. Some roared, some wailed, but their voices quickly vanished beneath the shadow of death. One sword swept across a neck; another noble's head rolled to the ground, blood gushing like flames. Another blade pierced a heart, staining a robe red. More blood soaked the stone floor, forming a crimson lake.\n\nIn the end, fifty corpses paved a blood-red path; blood flowed from wounds, dyeing the cold, hard flagstones. Carle ascended step by step, treading upon the bodies of Germans, finally standing atop the dais. His cloak fluttered slowly in the glow of battle's embers, like a king's banner. He raised both arms, muscles taut yet releasing an incomparable force and liberation. In that moment, time seemed to halt; only the scent of blood and glory trembled in the air.\n\nCarle's gaze penetrated this blood-washed hall, surveying the kingship he had reforged with iron and blood like a judge.\n\nVoices constantly surfaced in his mind, clear and sacred, as if God's own voice.

The one opening the gates was Gabriel, followed by Queen Bernadette, then some Paladins, and recently freed French ministers who had been imprisoned by Wilhelm.\n\n'Father!' Gabriel rushed forward, throwing himself into Carle's embrace.\nBernadette approached slowly, unable to hold back her tears.\n'Carle.'\nCarle said nothing, extending his arms to enfold Bernadette.

Carle's cold figure, like a sharp blade, had cut through Wilhelm's throat in the darkness, yet unexpectedly withdrew the killing edge. He did not let blood continue to flow in the hall, nor spread hatred to those German nobles not yet defeated. 'Get out! Return to your own lands and never come back!' Carle roared, then turned to leave the hall. As he reached the main doors, a dagger plunged into the back of his neck—a German had found the dagger hidden beneath Wilhelm's coat and hurled it at Carle. Carle turned in rage, but he no longer had strength to grasp his sword, nor even to stand.\n\nThe next day, news spread within the Lotharingian court: the royal consort Carle had died in the lodge. The German nobles hacked young Prince Gabriel into pieces, smearing his blood and flesh throughout the lodge hall, then releasing dogs to lick the remains. As for Queen Bernadette, it was said she was locked in another hall of the lodge. The remaining ninety-nine Germans took turns—some even in groups—entering her room. Those entering the Queen's chamber were not only men, but also various clubs, blades, even excrement and urine. No one knew what Queen Bernadette endured, but when servants entered the room the next day, they found only broken hair, an unspeakable corpse, and a room full of blood.\n\nThough Wilhelm was dead, the Germans continued to control Aachen, installing a German as king. The French did not accept this—but it mattered little, for the Germans never intended to rule a unified nation. If Lotharingia fractured, had not the German aim been achieved?"

EDG_LOT_disaster_frank.1.desc:0 "When the edicts of the Lotharingian Emperor descended like winter frost, commanding Rhineland peasants to recite scripture in unfamiliar French, ordering Tuscan poets to sing with Parisian meter, the empire's cracks finally erupted into gushing blood. Alessandro de' Medici—the Lion of Florence—raised a bloodstained cross beneath the shadow of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, roaring: 'They don't just want us to speak French—they want our descendants to forget their ancestors!' As Lotharingian bishops approached with gilded holy oil, he snapped his staff, a sound louder than any hymn. 'Your blessings are poison,' he sneered at trembling clerics, 'like your French—sweet lies wrapping conqueror's blades!' In the Piazza della Signoria, he set fire to the Royal Language Academy's tomes; rising from the ashes was not smoke, but battle standards raised by thousands of peasants chanting Tuscan dialect. 'They want French to be lord of the Po?' He mounted his warhorse, pointing his sword toward Milan. 'Then I'll make Italian their death knell!'\n\nIn the depths of the northern Black Forest, Bernhard of Wittelsbach's wolf-howl echoed from every castle's crenelations: 'Parisian courtiers are already measuring wheat fields on both Rhine banks. What will be taken next—your daughters or your graves?' Alessandro never knelt. Bernhard's armor bore ancient runes—not Latin, but Germanic Futhark passed down by ancestors. When imperial tax officials read new levies in clumsy French, he cut out their tongues and stuffed them into the scrolls. 'Hear that?' He raised a bloody battle-axe to the assembled princes. 'This is what Paris wants—our lands deeded in their tongue, our laws twisted at their whim!' In the shadow of the Emperor's Cathedral, he let soldiers shatter stained glass with German war cries: 'The Rhine forever flows with German beer's scent, not French decadent wine!'\n\nWhen the two forces converged at the Alpine passes, rebel blades seemed to reflect both Tyrrhenian sunsets and North Sea dawns. Alessandro's banners bore Dante's verses; Bernhard's horns sounded Nibelungen melodies. What bound them was a thousand dialects expressing the same curse: 'Better our homeland be scorched earth than become a garden for foreign tongues!' Chroniclers trembled recording this rebellion—it bore no official name, but survivors' ballads were so sorrowful that later ages called it only—the Great Dirge."

[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s pen was sharper than his sword. His Language Edict was not ink on parchment, but a molten golden spoon forcing each noble to open their mouths and accept this scalding honor.\n\n'Speak French, or speak your last words,' the court poet de Barrague wryly noted in his diary. Soon, old Germanic counts in Strasbourg discussed wine vintages with Parisian accents; Milanese officials strained to suppress Italian tremolo when reading decrees—as if their mother tongue were some original sin requiring confession. German was labeled the barbarian tongue, its death seeming to herald that the very concept of Germany, like Vandals and Goths, was swept into history's dust. Italian died more respectably: it was enshrined in a glass case, displayed for viewing in Florentine salons.\n\nPerhaps centuries later, when future armies discovered a German-inscribed stele in Ulm, the accompanying scholar would disdainfully brush dust from its surface: 'Look—this is the linguistic fossil scorched to death by the French sun.' And [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s statue would forever stand in Place de la Croix de Lorraine, the codex in his hand not Latin, nor Carolingian fragments, but inscribed in the purest French with a single line: 'What I give you is not merely rule, but existence itself.'"

'This is not rebellion,' he whispered to silent officers. 'Rebellion belongs only to the defeated.'\n\nIn the candlelit cellar of Strasbourg, owners of twelve swords sat around a round table. Adrian removed the Prime Minister's golden chain, casting it upon the table: 'Chains leash dogs, but not fate.' The major-general from the Rhine Legion offered the legion's eagle standard; the secret letter from the Archbishop of Namur was hidden between Bible pages; even court poets sang new verses: the age of iron and blood needs hands uncorrupted by purple robes.\n\n'As the Emperor reviewed remnants before Reims Cathedral, ministers secretly loyal to Adrian intercepted all couriers.

Peasants were forced to pray in unfamiliar tongues in fields; poets' rhythms were forcibly rewritten to Aachen's meter.\n\nAlessandro was captured. Dragged into the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, before the altar he had sworn to defend, the victor ordered a stone basin filled with bloodwater. That bloodwater was a flood from rebel and civilian corpses, mixed with holy oil and ash, foul and scalding. He was plunged into it, struggling to shout 'Italy,' but bloodwater filled his lungs; his voice became a series of broken bubbles vanishing in crimson depths. He died in his faith's sanctuary, drowned in blood, a sacrifice to imperial triumph."

EDG_LOT_disaster_religion.1.desc:0 "Even before the funeral bells for Bernadette had fully faded from the stone walls of [Root.Capital.GetName], the voice of Martin Luther swept like a gale through German valleys and marketplaces, tearing the Church's mantle and scattering the old incense from countless souls. In German cities, valleys, and hills, Protestants emerged—abandoning altars, desecrating icons, casting ancestral faith into furnaces. They claimed to seek truth, but in truth rebelled against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] on the throne called 'the Most Christian King,' against the ironclad Catholic order of [Root.GetName]. They lit bonfires by night not to pray but to burn the Lord's cross; gathered in streets not to sing hymns but to curse the Virgin with crude words. German soil, once belonging to monks' bells and cathedral stained glass, now filled with clamor and blasphemy. Rebellion spread like plague; every bell tower might be toppled, every sacred painting shredded. They called themselves believers of the new faith, yet used scripture to conceal butcher's knives. Bavarian monasteries were looted, sacred vessels melted into coin; Catholic towns along the Rhine were burned to ash, even infants' cries buried under collapsed roofs. Some rebels hung priests' corpses on city gates to taunt [Root.GetName].\n\nThe court's suppression brooked no hesitation. Flames rose into night skies like fire offerings to God, soaring toward heaven, illuminating the cross's shadow. In Würzburg, Paladins used altars as execution blocks, silencing blasphemous hands beneath blades; in Nuremberg, the rebel town hall was set ablaze, fire licking flags bearing Protestant marks; at Rhine crossings, captured heretics were forced to kneel toward the cross in water before sinking into icy depths. Heretic markets were swept clean, along with laughter lurking in shadows; churches regained icons, stained glass restored saints' gazes. Blood flowed into rivers, rivers became baptismal fonts; corpses lay in snow, snowfields became altars. This was purification, a true Lent—not fasting, but offering blood instead of wine, blades instead of bread, dedicated to God.\n\nIn [Root.Capital.GetName]'s cathedral, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally lit long candles before the altar; firelight reflected the crown's gold and Lotharingia's prestige.\n\nThe bloody wind did not stop at Germany. In the southern Arles, Cathar beliefs quietly revived; they gathered in shadowy alleys, calling each other 'the pure elect,' vowing to expel all Roman symbols; in British mountains, ancient Celtic altars rose anew, Druid chants blending with winds, reaching fishing villages and forts; on North Sea shores, Dutch Calvinists plotted in harbors, merchants and preachers together planning a federation against Catholicism under lamplight."

German Protestants, Arlesian Cathars, and Greater Celtic rebels, waving faith as banners, sought to tear apart this ancient realm. Their cries echoed in morning mists, mingling hope and despair, as if foretelling a great calamity. Paladins charged into streets; each sword swing, each burst of flame, was a clash of order and chaos, a struggle between life and death. Streets were consumed by blaze; screams echoed among rubble; falling crowds spread like waves, carrying apocalyptic weight.\n\nUpon Arlesian ruins, Cathar believers struggled amidst wreckage, trying to resist the irresistible iron tide with faith. Lofty towers were engulfed in flames; walls cracked and collapsed under firelight. Paladins moved like beasts in night; each charge was judgment upon the living, lament for the dead. Longswords split night skies; silhouettes of the fallen stretched in sunset's last glow, becoming tragic silhouettes.\nIn northern Celtic villages, once serene valleys and woodlands were torn into blood-red wastelands by conflict between rebels and Paladins. Torches ignited thatched huts; shrill horns and human screams interwove into dirges. Greater Celtic priests shouted for freedom on ruins, but steel and flame silenced their voices instantly. Wind swept through ravaged village paths, lifting dust and ash, carrying the scent of blood like a death hymn.\nWithin Germany, once city squares, alleys, and courtyards became canvases of blood. Protestants, Cathars, and rebellious nobles fell in resistance; their corpses baked under scorching sun, ultimately crushed by Paladins' iron hooves and spears. On city walls, tattered banners drooped; wind whispered through rubble, narrating an epic of sorrow. Human wails echoed in valleys; smoke coiled over towns like ghosts; every street was inscribed with death's rhythm.\n\nAfter long nights and brutal slaughter, rebellion finally quelled. Surviving lands lay in silence; cities under setting sun stood like tombstones carved in blood and ash. Wind passed through ruins, carrying sobs and remnants, as if performing an endless elegy for dead believers and traitors alike. Every castle, every field, was enveloped in solemn tragedy, silently recounting a history woven of fire, blood, and despair."

Followers of the Great Celtic Church believe Celts are God's chosen people; islands and highlands are their holy land. After the outbreak of religious wars, villages, towns, and monasteries in Celtic regions became conduits for this faith; clerics on stone churches and cliff altars shouted for independence and autonomy, calling believers to break free from [Root.GetName]'s bonds.
