string_start_weimar:0 "The earliest known history of Weimar dates back to §Ythe year 899 AD§!. The name originates from §YOld Germanic§!, meaning §Y'Sacred Marshland'§!. Compared to other regions in Germany, to survive in this barren, swampy terrain, the local inhabitants clearly §Yplaced greater emphasis on agricultural production and commercial trade§!. Over the next four centuries, through continuous economic expansion and diplomacy, Weimar gradually gained control over the entire §YThuringia region§! and maintained close political ties with the §YBishopric of Meissen§! to the north.\n\n§YIn the year 1062 AD§!, Weimar formed an alliance with another trading town to the west, §YOlarmund§!, reaching its historical zenith. However, for such a small nation in Northern Germany that §Yneglected military preparedness§!, the good days of §YWeimar-Olarmund§! would not last long. §YIn 1346 AD§!, the Thuringian War erupted. The feeble army of §YWeimar-Olarmund§! was no match for the §Yforces of the House of Wettin§! and quickly fell entirely.\n\n§YContrary to the history we know§!, God played a trick on the people of Weimar at this moment. The §YCzechs§! to the east chose to militarily intervene in the Thuringian War, seizing Weimar-Olarmund and Meissen from the Wettins. Overjoyed, the people of Weimar initially believed Bohemia was God's savior, but reality differed drastically from their expectations.\n\nAfter expelling the local nobility, Bohemia turned Weimar into a §YRepublic§!, but all key positions were filled by individuals appointed by Bohemia. These Czech puppets, though not nobles, were indistinguishable from them. Backed by Czech noble patrons, they became Weimar's new privileged class. They operated above the law and, alongside the Catholic Church, continuously exploited and stole the fruits of the people's labor, making Weimar's rich richer and its poor poorer.\n\n§YAfter the Hussite Wars broke out§!, Bohemia intensified its exploitation of Weimar and Meissen, worsening the plight of the already impoverished common folk. §YIn 1433 AD§!, §YSigismund§! of Luxembourg was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Bohemia forced Weimar to sign the §YTreaty of Olarmund§!, demanding all Weimar peasants surrender their entire harvest beyond subsistence rations to fight the Hussites.\n\nThe long-oppressed people were furious. The exploitation by the Catholic Church, privileged bureaucrats, and Czech nobility had reached its peak; social tensions were ready to erupt. §YIn 1440 AD§!, the angry people of Weimar launched a §YPeasant Uprising§! in Thuringia and Meissen, targeting the nobility, the Catholic Church, and the privileged class.\n\nLed by peasant leader §YThomas of Meissen§!, the Weimar rebel army threw all of Thuringia into chaos, vowing to create a heaven on earth free from exploitation and oppression.\n\nHad this uprising occurred in the Black Forest further north, the rebels might have had a chance of success. Unfortunately, their revolt took place right at the doorstep of the Empire's emperor. §YIn 1443 AD§!, Bohemia easily crushed the rebellion. Five thousand peasants perished at the §YBattle of Mühlhausen§!, and Thomas himself was §Yexecuted§! by Sigismund.\n\nWeimar's peasant uprising flared up like a spark and died out just as quickly. The increasingly frail Emperor Sigismund, to quell public anger, announced the withdrawal of all Czech nobility from Weimar, giving the last-gasp peasants a precious opportunity.\n\nNow Bohemian influence in Weimar wanes, and the weakened Holy Roman Emperor proves the lofty noble lords are not invincible. Should Emperor Sigismund pass, his empire will crumble—this is the final hope for the Weimar Republic caught between great powers. Rumors say the executed Thomas did not die but received God's favor, now wandering the skies of Northern Germany. §YAs for the truth of these rumors, that is for you to witness.§!"
