EDG_BRA_mission_3_11_desc:0 "The Ninety-Five Theses, posted by Martin Luther on the door of the All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517, were a list of propositions for debate protesting the Roman Catholic Church's sale of indulgences. They are considered the starting point of the Protestant Reformation. In the theses, Luther refuted the practice of selling 'indulgences' and opposed the method of using money for absolution. Luther pointed out that the Pope did not have the power to remit sins; therefore, the claim that indulgences could absolve sins was erroneous. Luther not only questioned the efficacy of indulgences but also exposed their sinful essence—exploitation. Its significance lay in being the first public negation of the Catholic Church's doctrine that only through the Church and the Pope could sins be absolved, thus gaining widespread acceptance across social strata. Luther's action angered the Papacy, and as events unfolded, the Theses became the catalyst for the religious reform movements in England and France."
EDG_BRA_mission_3_12_desc:0 "Each of the Ninety-Five Theses was a powerful blow against the fallacies and malpractices of the Papacy. The condemnation of indulgences acted like a spark landing on a powder keg, immediately igniting a prairie fire. Peasants and commoners saw Luther's anti-Church theses as a signal for uprising, believing the time had come to settle accounts with all oppressors."
EDG_BRA_mission_3_13_desc:0 "In 1525, the Prussian Teutonic Order announced its secularization and adopted Lutheranism as the territorial religion. In 1526, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, Elector John of Saxony, along with princes from Lüneburg, Prussia, Magdeburg, and others, formed the Torgau League, the first alliance of princes sympathetic to Lutheranism. At the Imperial Diet of Speyer that same year, they rejected Archduke of Austria's proposal to implement the Edict of Worms and prohibit religious reform, passing decrees favorable to Lutheran affairs: decisions concerning faith were to be left to the individual principalities."
EDG_BRA_mission_2_13_desc:0 "Religious conflict within the Empire has become inevitable. We have formed the Offhausen League, a military alliance of Protestant princes. This alliance will resolutely adhere to the principle of opposing the Catholic forces led by the Emperor, fighting for the freedom and faith of all Protestants in the protracted religious wars to come."
EDG_BRA_mission_3_14_desc:0 "Protestant princes and cities immediately united in the face of challenges from the Catholic Church. Their representatives assembled in the mountainous town of Schmalkalden in southwestern Saxony and formed the Schmalkaldic League in February 1531. By this time, Lutheranism had spread throughout Germany. Among the states and cities that joined Protestantism, besides Saxony and Hesse, significant ones included Ansbach, Bayreuth, Anhalt, Mansfeld, Brunswick, Lüneburg, Schleswig, Holstein, East Frisia, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Prussia, parts of Silesia, and cities such as Magdeburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Reutlingen, Constance, Strasbourg, Hamburg, Lübeck, and Rostock. Geographically, the vast lands of Northern Germany north of the Main River and the extensive plains of Eastern Germany largely fell into Protestant hands, while Southern Germany and Austria remained strongholds of Catholic princes."
