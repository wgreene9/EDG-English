EDG_XTJ_1_desc:0 "In May 1333, Nitta Yoshisada, the 8th head of the Nitta clan, raised an army against the Ashikaga clan. After numerous battles, he ultimately joined forces with Kusunoki Masashige and others to defeat Ashikaga Takauji, establishing the Nitta clan as one of the foremost military houses for their meritorious service in overthrowing the shogunate."
EDG_XTJ_2_desc:0 "The Nitta clan descends from the Seiwa Genji line. Their ancestor was Yoshishige, eldest son of Minamoto no Yoshikuni (third son of Minamoto no Yoshiie), who later cultivated the lands around Mount Asama, establishing the Nitta estate and taking its name, thus founding the Nitta clan."
EDG_XTJ_3_desc:0 "After the Nanboku-chō period, the Nitta clan was dispatched to Kantō, receiving three provinces. Through years of governance, they essentially eradicated the remaining Northern Court Ashikaga forces, bringing the Kantō region under their direct control."
EDG_XTJ_4_desc:0 "The 'Esshū Laws', promulgated by the Nitta clan in 1403, was their first domain-wide legal document. It detailed tax categories in Esshū province and standardized punishments for various crimes. As a typical bunkoku-hō (domain law), it marked the Nitta clan's formal transformation into a Sengoku daimyō."
EDG_XTJ_5_desc:0 "With substantial investment from the Nitta clan, Nagaoka Castle primarily served as the training ground for the clan's internal forces. Soldiers trained at Nagaoka Castle were well-equipped, highly disciplined, and maintained excellent morale - earning them the nickname 'Iron Army' from those who fought against them."
EDG_XTJ_6_desc:0 "After the Nanboku-chō period, the new shogunate established by the Imperial Court appointed the Nitta clan as Protectors of Eastern Japan, granting them oversight of eastern affairs and responsibility for monitoring remaining Northern Court influence in the region. Over time, the Nitta clan grew into a powerful force in Kantō."
EDG_XTJ_7_desc:0 "Upon assuming clan leadership, Nitta Yoshiuke immediately initiated sweeping reforms across the domain. These included reorganization of household registries and redistribution of territories. Following these reforms, the Nitta clan significantly strengthened its control at the local level and substantially increased centralization of authority."

EDG_JCJ_7:0 "Toshiuji's Centralization"
EDG_JCJ_1_desc:0 "After the Nanboku-chō period, the Yūki clan was granted Mutsu Province - a traditionally remote region. While development was constrained, this effectively distanced the Yūki family from the complex political situations in Kinai and Kantō."
EDG_JCJ_2_desc:0 "Mutsu Province remained severely underdeveloped in 14th-15th century Japan. After successfully taking control from Northern Court samurai forces, the Yūki clan continuously engaged in reclamation activities on wastelands, actively attracting numerous migrants from Kinai and Kantō - whether political exiles or petty thieves could find refuge in Ōshū."
EDG_JCJ_3_desc:0 "Benefiting from Mutsu's advantageous geographical position, the Yūki clan easily conducted cross-sea trade with Ezo. Numerous Ezo products continuously flowed from Mutsu into Honshū, and even Shikoku and Kyushu regions."
EDG_JCJ_4_desc:0 "After being granted Mutsu Province, the Yūki clan was soon appointed by the Imperial Court as Ōshū Tandai - the plenipotentiary governor of Mutsu. With official appointment documents legitimizing their authority, the Yūki clan could better control local powers in Mutsu and utilize them for their own purposes."
EDG_JCJ_5_desc:0 "As the shogunal authority gradually declined from the 15th century, major powers began growing restless. The Yūki clan was no exception. Using the pretext of attacking Ezo across the sea under the name of 'Expel Barbarians Mobilization', they massively recruited local Mutsu residents into their private army. However, everyone understood that the Ezo across the sea posed no real threat - this was merely an excuse for southern expansion."
EDG_JCJ_6_desc:0 "The Tsugaru Strait, as the vital passage connecting Wajin territories to mainland Honshū, teemed with various merchants. Starting in 1389, the Yūki clan began establishing a navy, interfering with Tsugaru Strait trade under the pretext of 'coastal defense patrol'. All merchants passing through the strait were required to pay a 'maritime patrol fee'."
EDG_JCJ_7_desc:0 "In 1433, Yūki Toshiuji initiated reforms to the local governance structure. He extensively stripped local chieftains of their jurisdictional rights, transferring authority to his own retainers. The Yūki clan's political centralization gradually became apparent."

EDG_ZSJ_6:0 "Scion of Noble House"
EDG_ZSJ_7:0 "Dewa Sanzan"
EDG_ZSJ_1_desc:0 "After the 1368 Battle of Urushigawa, the Mogami clan essentially eliminated the Southern Court-loyal Sagae clan forces in Dewa. Following the Southern Court's victory, due to the Mogami clan's remote location from the central Honshū authority and their underdeveloped status, they fortuitously escaped the purge of Northern Court sympathizers after the Southern Court's triumph."
EDG_ZSJ_2_desc:0 "After the Urushigawa Battle, the Mogami clan was appointed as the Northern Court's Ushū Tandai. When the Southern Court achieved victory, the Mogami clan naturally lost this title. However, as shogunal authority declined and urgently needed new agents to control various regions, the Mogami clan was reappointed as Ushū Tandai in 1436. That the shogunate's authority didn't actually increase was another matter altogether."
EDG_ZSJ_3_desc:0 "The Tendō clan represents the Mogami's largest branch family in Ushū. The two clans alternated between separation and union, sometimes conflicting, sometimes allying. Although they constantly competed covertly, when the Mogami faced genuine crisis, the Tendō clan - as part of their extended family - would still step forward to assist."
EDG_ZSJ_4_desc:0 "The 'Twenty Articles of Ushū', promulgated after the Mogami clan's reappointment as Ushū Tandai in 1436, served as their natural legal document and became one of the more famous Sengoku period bunkoku-hō. It detailed retainer promotion methods, established permanent official positions, and standardized local taxation, marking the initial establishment of the Mogami clan's legal system."
EDG_ZSJ_5_desc:0 "The Mogami clan maintained an exceptionally large number of branch families, with seventeen major branches. This extensive branch system enhanced grassroots governance capabilities in Dewa Province and strengthened the Mogami clan's control over local territories."
EDG_ZSJ_6_desc:0 "The Mogami clan descended from the prestigious Shiba clan - a main branch of the Northern Court's Ashikaga shogunal family. Although during the Southern Court's political dominance, the Mogami identity couldn't secure much political advantage compared to other daimyō, their Ashikaga lineage still attracted significant attention from Northern Court traditionalists."
EDG_ZSJ_7_desc:0 "Dewa Sanzan comprises the three sacred mountains: Haguro-san, Yudono-san, and Gassan. By the 15th century, the local shrines had existed for seven to eight hundred years. Tradition held that only those who completed ascetic training on Gassan and Haguro-san could achieve Buddhahood here. Consequently, numerous devout Buddhists made pilgrimages to these sites annually."

EDG_GFN_1_desc:0 "The turmoil of the Northern and Southern Courts and Ashikaga Takauji's rebellion posed significant challenges to the Emperor's restoration of authority. Since the Genpei War, samurai power had become thoroughly entrenched in Japan. Even the descendants of Amaterasu had to operate within the new rules reshaped by the warrior class. While reconstructing the foundations of rule, the Imperial Court inevitably needed to reconcile the court nobility with the military houses."
EDG_GFN_2_desc:0 "Upon Emperor Go-Daigo's restoration, he and his advisors profoundly understood that without adequate economic and military foundations, noble bloodline and Amaterasu's divine authority alone were insufficient to govern this island nation. In the eyes of the restored court, directly controlled manors represented crucial economic foundations - without rice and resources, they would remain perpetually constrained."
EDG_GFN_3_desc:0 "After Emperor Go-Daigo's restoration, having crushed the samurai rebels led by Ashikaga Takauji, the Emperor and court enjoyed unprecedented prestige. To reshape the ruling order, the court issued the 'Sōbujirei' nationwide, demanding all military houses submit to the Emperor and cease all armed conflicts among themselves."
EDG_GFN_4_desc:0 "Mount Yoshino, south of Kyoto, served as both a famous summer retreat and strategic high ground. Moreover, it was where Prince Ōtomo and warrior monks had once fought. After Prince Ōtomo ascended as Emperor Go-Kameyama, he oversaw construction of Yoshino Palace - built entirely as a fortress. Subsequently, all retired emperors would reside here, remotely governing Kyoto affairs from this tranquil sanctuary that provided an ideal stage for imperial authority."
EDG_GFN_5_desc:0 "Emperor Go-Daigo's restoration was inseparable from warrior monk support. Prince Moriyoshi, former Tendai sect head who became Emperor Go-Kameyama, further strengthened this relationship. The Emperor placed imperial princes in temples, directly infiltrating religious institutions, while accomplished monks frequently served as close advisors and strategists - though the unorthodox Ikkō-ī remained excluded."
EDG_GFN_6_desc:0 "Although the Imperial Shogunate's direct control was limited to the Kinai region, this didn't mean the court abandoned claims over other territories. In autumn 1352, the court first established a governor in Settsu Province at Sakai Port. Within five years, remote provincial offices designed to collect commercial taxes at key transportation hubs sprang up like mushrooms."
EDG_GFN_7_desc:0 "'His Imperial Majesty, descendant of Amaterasu, Emperor Jimmu and his heirs - eternal as imperial authority itself, he is Takamagahara's projection upon earth, the unbroken line equal to sun and moon in longevity.'"

EDG_MHE_1_desc:0 "After the Southern Court's complete victory, the Nawa clan was transferred from Inaba and Hōki to become Governors of Izumo. Though newcomers to the region, their immense prestige at court enabled them to establish an effective administration."
EDG_MHE_2_desc:0 "The Nawa clan contributed indispensably to both the establishment of the Kenbu regime and its ultimate triumph, rendering tremendous service to the Imperial Court. The family consequently achieved great renown and occupied a prominent position in court affairs."
EDG_MHE_3_desc:0 "Izumo Grand Shrine, one of Japan's oldest Shinto shrines, attracts endless streams of worshippers and has become the San'in region's most celebrated religious sanctuary. This sacred site clearly brought the local ruling Nawa clan not only economic benefits but also enhanced prestige."
EDG_MHE_4_desc:0 "As the right hand of the Imperial Shogunate, the Nawa family consistently held the position of Grand Minister of State. Although this had gradually evolved into a titular honor, it undoubtedly remained a distinguished privilege."
EDG_MHE_5_desc:0 "The 'Fifteen Articles of Nawa' was the first domain law promulgated by the Nawa clan, symbolizing their formal emergence as a Sengoku daimyō. This legislation consolidated the Nawa clan's internal governance and laid solid foundations for their expansion."
EDG_MHE_6_desc:0 "During the late Kamakura period, our ancestors accumulated substantial wealth through maritime trade, ultimately becoming a powerful local clan in Hōki Province. This also provided the foundation for our later political ascendancy. Today, we continue to uphold our mercantile traditions by engaging with distant nations."
EDG_MHE_7_desc:0 "At the Battle of Chikugogawa, we defeated the Northern Court forces, clearing the path for the Kenbu regime's entry into Kyushu. It can be said this is a battle we will forever remember and cherish."

EDG_NNM_1_desc:0 "While common villagers might not recognize Emperor Go-Daigo's name, none haven't heard tales of Kusunoki Masashige, the Great Kusunoki. As a Kinai noble clan, Kusunoki Masashige contributed immensely to the Emperor's emancipation from samurai constraints and restoration of imperial authority, receiving governorships of Izumi and Settsu provinces to become the foremost daimyō in the capital region. The fourth family head was additionally appointed Governor of Sagami, constructing Odawara Castle primarily to check the persistently rebellious Hōjō clan for the Emperor."
EDG_NNM_2_desc:0 "Sakai Port boasts ancient history, with artifacts related to foreign trade found in 1500-year-old tomb excavations. Even before Japan's official port openings, Sakai served as a vital harbor for trade with China and Korea. Under Kusunoki management, Sakai Port has become the realm's commercial center."
EDG_NNM_3_desc:0 "Torai-jin refers to foreigners who migrated to Japan from China, Korea, and elsewhere during ancient times. Most came for political, commercial, or cultural reasons, with some becoming court officials, wealthy merchants, or cultural leaders. When the Yuan Dynasty descended into civil strife, numerous Koreans and Chinese crossed the seas to Naniwa, gradually forming Torai-jin communities."
EDG_NNM_4_desc:0 "During the Nanboku-chō period, a military school emerged tracing its lineage to Kusunoki Masashige's strategies and tactics - the renowned "Kawachi Wise General." This evolved into an early modern military science tradition. Among Sengoku commanders, some already treated war chronicles like Taiheiki and Nantaiheiki as guides for governance and strategy. Entering the new era, scholars revisited the brilliant strategies of Masashige and his clan, adding original commentary to systematize this as military science, creating the Kusunoki-ryū school that appeared across various regions."
EDG_NNM_5_desc:0 "Ōsaka's terrain forms a plateau with undulating elevations, earning it the name "Plateau of the Realm." This topography also facilitated urban transportation, as the surrounding hills provided natural transportation barriers, making travel between Ōsaka and neighboring cities more convenient."
EDG_NNM_6_desc:0 "The Kusunoki clan's victories made their Kikusui (chrysanthemum water) banner widely influential in Japanese culture and arts. In traditional martial arts like bujutsu, kendō, and kyūdō, the Kikusui banner often symbolizes samurai spirit and tradition, representing warrior ethos, courage, and loyalty as integral components of Japanese culture."
EDG_NNM_7_desc:0 "Whether the Kusunoki's home castle of Ōsaka or eastern Odawara Castle, both rank among Japan's foremost impregnable fortresses. This owes not only to master builders' craftsmanship but also to the Kusunoki clan's continuous support and investment."

EDG_YIT_1_desc:0 "The Ichijō family, descendants of the Northern Fujiwara clan, represent one of the Five Regent Houses embodying supreme honor - historically only these five families' heads could attain the regent position. However, after losing political struggles in Kyoto, the Ichijō relocated their entire clan to their Tosa Hata manor, being appointed as Tosa shugo. While seemingly defeated in Kyoto's political arena, this didn't signify their complete withdrawal from influence."
EDG_YIT_2_desc:0 "Since arriving in Shikoku, through continuous cultivation, the Ichijō successfully rooted Kyoto's culture in Tosa. Local Tosa nobles took pride in emulating Ichijō etiquette, considering invitations to waka gatherings or Noh performances supreme honors. The Ichijō's main castle earned the nickname Little Kyoto."
EDG_YIT_3_desc:0 "Although Kyoto nobles training retainers within the Imperial Shogunate was no secret, the Ichijō's military preparations outside Kyoto astonished their court counterparts. In Tosa, they were described as court nobles inside compound walls, warrior nobles outside. To survive in the samurai world, even the Ichijō had to adapt appropriately."
EDG_YIT_4_desc:0 "The Ichijō weren't the only prestigious family coming to Tosa. As the Kinai region descended into renewed chaos, a branch of the Saionji family - one of the Nine Noble Houses - also migrated to western Shikoku. Fortunately, the Saionji didn't challenge Ichijō's local dominance, naturally becoming important retainers and making indelible contributions to Tosa's development."
EDG_YIT_5_desc:0 "Tosa Bay, washed by the Kuroshio Current, provided natural trading grounds. Chinese and Southeast Asian vessels transiting through Ryukyu via the current easily reached Tosa. The Ichijō's open trade attitude welcomed smugglers from Wu, Yue, and Min regions, who established trading posts at Nakamura Castle."
EDG_YIT_6_desc:0 "Tosa Province never formed Japan's core territory - its mountainous, forested terrain made it a remote wilderness far from Kyoto. After the Ichijō's arrival, they worked to unite various local lords and daimyō under their banner. Six families - Motoyama, Kira, Aki, Tsuno, Kōsokabe, Ōhira, and Chōsokabe - allied with the Ichijō as federation leaders, collectively called the Seven Lords of Tosa."
EDG_YIT_7_desc:0 "No other daimyō possessed the Ichijō's illustrious lineage and Junior Second Rank authority. The Ichijō masterfully blended court culture with warrior substance."

EDG_AKM_1_desc:0 "The Akamatsu clan is said to descend from Emperor Murakami. As legitimate imperial descendants, the Akamatsu naturally commanded considerable prestige among Japan's warrior nobility."
EDG_AKM_2_desc:0 "At the Battle of Hakone, we suffered catastrophic defeat against the Nitta forces, leaving our regime severely weakened. However, from that moment we recognized our backwardness and initiated comprehensive military reforms to wash away this disgrace."
EDG_AKM_3_desc:0 "We initially supported Emperor Go-Daigo's Southern Court government, but circumstances forced our shift to the Northern Court. Though the Northern Court ultimately failed, we maintained connections within both Southern Court and former Northern Court factions."
EDG_AKM_4_desc:0 "Despite choosing the wrong side in the conflict, the Kamakura shogunate needed a family positioned near the Imperial Shogunate to counterbalance its influence. Our strategic territorial placement proved ideal, leading the Hōjō to grant us shugo titles over Harima, Tajima, and Bizen provinces."
EDG_AKM_5_desc:0 "While possessing three extensive provinces, unlike other shugo who relied on local nobles for governance, we placed our territories under direct rule by several main family scions. This approach forged stronger bonds between localities and our central authority."
EDG_AKM_6_desc:0 "As former vassals of the Muromachi shogunate, we maintain intricate connections with the Ashikaga regime despite its ultimate failure."
EDG_AKM_7_desc:0 "As Imperial Shogunate and shogunal control over regions weakened, our vassals grew restless. However, under our daimyō's astute leadership, numerous local rebellions were crushed, preserving our regime amid the rising tide of ge-kokujō."
