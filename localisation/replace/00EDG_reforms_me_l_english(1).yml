EDG_Militarism_government_desc:0 "This is a reform only available to military states. For the past few centuries, feudal conscription has dominated military history. However, with the progress of the times, the potential of army professionalization has grown increasingly significant, as the quality of the army can, to some extent, greatly compensate for its quantity."

EDG_Saints_nobles_reform:0 "Noble Religious Duties"
EDG_Saints_nobles_reform_desc:0 "A large portion of the clergy in our nation consists of nobles, which is both the reality and by design. Nobles without inheritance rights or a place to go can seek a path by joining the church. This ensures that church lands and wealth remain under noble control rather than being managed by clergy of commoner origin. Having gained such extensive rights from both state and religion, reinforcing the nobles' obligation to propagate the faith is an inevitable requirement for societal development."
EDG_Austrian_Empire_govenment_reform:0 "Austrian Imperial Government"
EDG_Austrian_Empire_govenment_reform_desc:0 "The Austrian Empire is an undisputed great power in Europe and one of the world's major powers. Under the impact of revolution, liberalism, and national equality, anti-Habsburg activities across its territories have become increasingly active. The Austrian imperial house has always been concerned that revolutionary waves might endanger its ruling authority, actively intervening in the affairs of other European nations to suppress revolutions. On the other hand, successive Austrian emperors have been devout Catholics. As a result, the Papacy granted the Holy Roman Emperor a veto in papal elections, a power later transferred to the Austrian Emperor until it was abolished by the College of Cardinals in 1914."

EDG_Integration_of_military_and_government_reform_desc:0 "This is a reform only available to military states. There has long been a strong voice within our country advocating for militarization.

EDG_Sun_King_reform:0 "The State of the Sun King"
EDG_Sun_King_reform_desc:0 "The great Sun King reinterpreted the concept of 'monarchy' in Europe through his words and actions, sparking a wave of strengthening monarchical absolutism across the continent. Strengthening monarchical absolutism also had positive significance in Europe at that time, as it helped further eliminate feudal fragmentation by local lords and laid the groundwork for the formation of nation-states."
EDG_Caste_System_reform:0 "Strengthening the Caste System"
EDG_Caste_System_reform_desc:0 "The caste system, centered around the ruling class, divides society into many endogamous groups based on occupation, known as castes. Each caste is further subdivided into numerous sub-castes based on region of residence. These sub-castes are then divided into settlement castes according to different residential communities, which are finally broken down into clans practicing exogamy. This intricate, interlocking structure integrates into a social system spread across the entire Indian subcontinent. Deeply intertwined with Hinduism and the Indian people, the caste system will continue to contribute to our rule."
EDG_Duma_reform:0 "Assembly of the Land (Zemsky Sobor)"
EDG_Duma_reform_desc:0 "In the early years of Ivan IV's reign, domestic class conflicts were acute, the separatist forces of the princes and boyar nobility remained strong, and the tsarist regime was highly unstable. Ivan IV relied on service nobles and urban townspeople to suppress popular uprisings while continuously contending with the boyar aristocracy. To adjust relations within the ruling class and facilitate his rule over the entire country, at the end of February 1549, Ivan IV convened a joint conference in Moscow attended by boyars, service nobles, high-ranking clergy, and senior government officials. The conference decided to compile a new legal code to replace the Code of 1497 (the Code of Ivan III) and announced reforms aimed at consolidating imperial power. This was the first 'Assembly of the Land' (Zemsky Sobor), or estates-representative assembly, in Russian history. Its convening marked the establishment of an estates-representative monarchy in Russia. Thereafter, major state affairs were discussed and decided by the Assembly of the Land, attended by representatives of three estates: nobility, clergy, and urban townspeople. The nobility played a leading role in the assembly. The duration and agenda of the assemblies were determined by the tsar. While representatives of state peasants occasionally participated, the majority of the population—serfs bound by contracts and debt—were excluded."

EDG_zemsky_sobor:0 "Old Assembly of the Land"
EDG_zemsky_sobor_desc:0 "Since ancient times, the monarchical authority in Volhynia has appeared weak, with the boyars seizing state power. Our Assembly of the Land bears the same name as the one established by Ivan the Great, yet in practice, it differs significantly. Our assembly serves as a platform for powerful nobles to demand concessions from the monarch. Only the most formidable rulers can rein in these arrogant nobles, and a strong monarch will inevitably push the nation toward reform, though this is certain to cause turmoil."
EDG_zemsky_sobor_new:0 "Reformed Assembly of the Land"
EDG_zemsky_sobor_new_desc:0 "Once, the monarchical authority in Volhynia appeared weak since ancient times, with the boyars seizing state power. But now, we have completed national reforms, establishing an estates-based monarchy. The Assembly of the Land has become a tool of the monarch rather than a shackle, assisting us in building a new Slavic state on the lands of Eastern Europe."
EDG_Decision_on_standby_service_reform:0 "Standby Service Decree"
EDG_Decision_on_standby_service_reform_desc:0 "From 1549 to 1560, reforms were implemented in administration, law, finance, military, religion, and other areas at both central and local levels. Ivan IV's government strove to consolidate autocratic rule and strengthen state centralization. The core of its military reforms included perfecting the military command system, restricting the appointment of officers based on lineage, establishing a standing army, reorganizing the duties of local Russian forces, and adjusting border garrison and stationed service. These reforms laid the foundation for the Russian regular army. During his reign, the first military code—'The Boyar Council Decree on Stationed and Garrison Service'—was formulated. Ivan IV's reforms, particularly the military reforms, propelled Russia toward greatness."
EDG_Sofia_Court_reform:0 "Sofia Court Reforms"
EDG_Sofia_Court_reform_desc:0 "When Princess Sofia married into Moscow, she brought with her a large collection of books that were rescued from Constantinople just before the fall of the Byzantine Empire. On one hand, these books played a significant role in Russia's cultural development; on the other, the Grand Duchy of Moscow's inheritance and advancement of Byzantine culture proved irreplaceable. In this sense, the view of Moscow as the 'Third Rome' holds some basis. Following Sofia's arrival, the court system of the Grand Duchy of Moscow was reformed according to Byzantine imperial standards. From then on, Moscow's regulations and ceremonies gradually became comprehensive, forming a complete system. The various ceremonies held at the court were required to be conducted with strict decorum, making them more solemn, grand, and reflective of a great power's demeanor."

EDG_Code_of_Ivan_reform:0 "Code of Ivan III"
EDG_Code_of_Ivan_reform_desc:0 "Ivan III promulgated a legal code (Sudebnik), historically known as the 'Code of Ivan III,' to consolidate state power under centralized rule. It established the governmental institutions of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and laid the legal foundation for ending feudal fragmentation. This code designated the Byzantine double-headed eagle as Russia's national emblem and engraved its image onto the Russian state seal."

EDG_Czar_special_control_reform:0 "Tsar's Oprichnina"
EDG_Czar_special_control_reform_desc:0 "The Oprichnina was an extraordinary system implemented by Russian Tsar Ivan IV (the Terrible) from 1565 to 1572 to crush the feudal separatist forces of the great nobility and boyars and consolidate the centralized Russian state. The setbacks in the Livonian War and the betrayal by the boyars in 1564 prompted Ivan IV to announce the implementation of the Oprichnina in January 1565. The entire territory was divided into two parts: the Oprichnina (special realm) and the Zemshchina (landed realm)."

EDG_Basque_sovereignty_reform:0 "Basque Sovereignty"
EDG_Basque_sovereignty_reform_desc:0 "The prosperous and stable Kingdom of Navarre implemented a system of municipal autonomy rare in the world at that time.

EDG_Bolyar_Alliance:0 "Boyar Alliance"
EDG_Bolyar_Alliance_desc:0 "The boyars within our nation are the most significant landowners.

The boyars exercise complete control over their hereditary estates, and the monarch has limited power to interfere."

EDG_Military_Aircraft_Commission:0 "Military Aircraft Commission"
EDG_Military_Aircraft_Commission_desc:0 "The Military Aircraft Commission is a military advisory body established within our government. While not the statutory highest military authority, its members are the nation's most important generals, making the commission the de facto supreme military institution.

EDG_plt_monarchy:0 "Vseslav's Throne Hall"
EDG_plt_monarchy_desc:0 "The Principality of Polotsk was a state established by the East Slavs within the Rus' lands. Initially, it appears to have been ruled by incoming Norsemen. Around 980, Vladimir Sviatoslavich, the Novgorodian prince of the Rurik dynasty, conquered the region during his struggle for the throne of Kiev and forced a Norse princess into marriage. Their descendants became the successive princes of Polotsk, including the great Vseslav, who campaigned extensively, once sacked Novgorod, and purged domestic reactionary forces. He established a powerful guard army fully accountable to the military. This guard was raised through a conscription of one man from every ten households, serving not only as a formidable force in Polotsk's external wars but also as a crucial unit for wealth extraction and land distribution. The influence of the Polotsk Guard will be immense, granting us access to government reforms typically available only to militarized states."

EDG_ARA_Militarization_monarchy:0 "Aragonese Militarization"
EDG_ARA_Militarization_monarchy_desc:0 "The highlands of northeastern Iberia were a paradise for bandits. Before order was established, isolated villages were defenseless against raiders.

EDG_azo_monarchy:0 "Divan"
EDG_azo_monarchy_desc:0 "Our state is composed of various Beyliks. The highest state institution is the Divan Council, whose authority even surpasses that of the monarch, serving to provide counsel on major state affairs. Members eligible to attend the Divan include tribal chiefs and clergy from various regions. These local leaders view the territories of their Beyliks as their own property, inherited from ancestors as legitimate and traditional as the monarch themselves. The monarch holds almost no influence or power within the Beyliks; the monarch's officials cannot even perform basic functions like tax collection or law enforcement within Beylik territories."

EDG_CAS_Militarization_monarchy:0 "Iberian Military Governance"
EDG_CAS_Militarization_monarchy_desc:0 "The triumphant advance of the Reconquista has brought us the Promised Land for Christians, and the conquerors' blades—the Order of Calatrava and other newly risen wartime elites—have gradually elevated their status in society. As the conquered lands expand, these new lords naturally extend the military governance system to the estates and territories granted to them, forming a Christian-style military administration. If the king is our head, then the army is our skeleton."

EDG_GAL_republic:0 "Aristocratic Territorial Federation"
EDG_GAL_republic_desc:0 "Our state is a republic established by the nobility, but it is a federation formed by the union of multiple territories. The supreme authority is the National Assembly composed of great noble leaders, where factional struggles are intense. The nationally elected leader is more competent, yet any potential for dictatorship raises doubts among the people about the state."

EDG_Norman_Monarchy:0 "Norman Monarchy"
EDG_Norman_Monarchy_desc:0 "The Normans swiftly imitated what they observed, a trait evident in every land they settled. However, their imitation was far from uncreative and certainly did not constitute the entirety of their achievements. A more accurate explanation for Norman success is their boundless confidence and exceptional ability to establish organizations suited to their purposes in newly acquired territories. Thus, their control over Apulia and Sicily was based on their belief in their military superiority, the strategic use of castles and ports, and the introduction of feudalism to govern the relationships between counts or kings and their more important vassals. In administration, however, they adopted the highly advanced and largely bureaucratic methods of the Byzantine Greeks and Muslims. The Normans introduced a Norman-flavored feudal system to southern Italy, along with their concepts of strongman governance and fiscal organization. Yet they also adopted many of the existing local institutions and customs. Norman rule also brought many innovations, such as establishing the Treasury, implementing the itinerant justice system, shifting to trial by jury, creating a royal guard loyal to the monarch, and strengthening the management of state territories."

EDG_Denomination:0 "Autocratic Taifa"
EDG_Denomination_desc:0 "Taifa refers to the numerous Muslim states in southern Iberia. Most of these small realms were short-lived, governing independently and warring amongst themselves. They often sought aid from Christian states to oppose rival Muslim kings or turned to North African kingdoms for help against Christian monarchs. The fickle nature of these Taifa states made them prime targets for the growing Christian reconquest forces."

EDG_Sigismund_congres:0 "Hungarian Magnate Diet"
EDG_Sigismund_congres_desc:0 "Emperor Sigismund was frequently absent from Hungary, entrusting state affairs to a few trusted proxy nobles. While this ensured his authority and revenue in Hungary, his proxies were often ineffective in resolving civil issues, frequently inciting popular discontent. The rise of the urban middle class at the time greatly amplified such dissatisfaction, granting the national diet (with urban representatives) greater governance responsibilities. Although the regional power of the magnates and oligarchs could not be broken, they were required to provide mercenaries or commutation payments to the state, effectively increasing central authority. This development was closely tied to Sigismund's political support for the lesser nobility and his proactive policies promoting urban growth, marking one of his most positive and effective governance achievements."

EDG_ottoman_empire_government:0 "Ottoman Imperial Government"
EDG_ottoman_empire_government_desc:0 "Over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire developed an advanced state apparatus known as the Ottoman Imperial bureaucracy. It featured a highly centralized government with the Sultan as the supreme ruler, effectively governing localities, people, and officials. Titles such as Vizier and Aga denoted official ranks. The military was a crucial pillar in maintaining the hierarchical system. The Ottoman Sultan was the empire's regent, effectively embodying the government. The Imperial Harem was a significant power center within the Ottoman court, presided over by the Valide Sultan (Queen Mother). She held absolute authority within the harem and occupied a revered position. The Ottoman Empire had numerous vassal states of varying sizes. These vassals were required to pay taxes to the Sultan and provide military support during wars. Upon reestablishing the Ottoman Empire, we will enter a prolonged period of strength, which can compensate for our governmental shortcomings. However, once this period of strength wanes, the inherent flaws of the government will gradually become exposed."

EDG_Ireland_Alliance_desc:0 "In the 12th century, King Henry II of England invaded Ireland and successfully ruled the entire island, proclaiming himself Lord of Ireland. He strengthened the feudal system in Ireland, giving it its first central institutions, and ultimately passed the title to Richard the Lionheart. After Richard's death, Ireland was inherited by his nephew, Arthur. However, following Arthur's murder by John, Ireland descended into chaos, and the Plantagenet dynasty completely lost control over Ireland. An Irish general claiming descent from Cormac mac Airt, Patrick Art, seized control of the Lordship of Ireland and declared himself High King. Patrick compromised with the feudal lords across Ireland, granting significant autonomy to local nobility in exchange for their support. He also vigorously sought papal backing, promising to reform the corrupt state of the Irish Church, which secured his opportunity for coronation as king."

EDG_Ireland_monarchy:0 "Irish Autocratic Monarchy"
EDG_Ireland_monarchy_desc:0 "The feudal order established in Ireland by Patrick Art granted extensive local autonomy, greatly limiting the monarch's power.

While the Hussite Wars raged in Bohemia, a group of lesser Polish nobles in Sandomierz also absorbed Hussite ideas, becoming convinced that Hus's views represented the truth for Christendom. After the death of Władysław III, the already unstable Poland effectively split into three states, one of which was Sandomierz. Through bloody conflict, the Hussite lesser nobility of Sandomierz ultimately defeated the local Catholic magnates, seized state power, and established a republic based on Hus's doctrines and the traditions of the Polish Sejm. The supreme authority of this state is the fanatical Purification Committee."

EDG_French_feudal_system:0 "French Feudal System"
EDG_French_feudal_system_desc:0 "In 987, the Carolingian dynasty of West Francia died out. The French nobility refused to support the weak Carolingian lords within the country or accept a powerful Carolingian monarch from a neighboring kingdom. Ultimately, Hugues Capet, Duke of the Franks, was elected King of the Franks by the nobility, founding the Capetian dynasty. Historians view this as the beginning of the Kingdom of France. However, from Hugues Capet to Louis VII, the kings still styled themselves as Kings of the Franks. Philip Augustus was the first monarch to use the title King of France. The Kingdom of France long practiced the feudal system, failing to achieve centralization. The great vassals within the country enjoyed extensive autonomy, some even surpassing the monarch in power, yet they still nominally acknowledged the King of France as their sovereign. This was a norm under the French feudal system."

EDG_French_hierarchical_monarchy:0 "French Estates-based Monarchy"
EDG_French_hierarchical_monarchy_desc:0 "An estates-based monarchy is a form of governance where royal power is exercised through an assembly of estates, with the nobility and burgher classes participating in government and sharing power to a certain extent. This was one of the key features of Western European 'feudalism.' During the period of estates-based monarchy, judicial and military powers gradually centralized, while the assembly of estates primarily controlled the approval and allocation of state taxes. The interests and demands of the burgher class began to receive attention. Compared to the political chaos and fragmentation of the early Middle Ages, the estates-based monarchy represented historical progress, fostering further socio-economic development. The English Parliament convened in 1265 and the French Estates-General held in 1302 marked the initial formation of estates-based monarchies in England and France. After the French king successfully integrated the domestic feudal system, the French estates-based monarchy was firmly established."

By the mid-9th century, Castile had expanded but remained a collection of small, scattered counties, whose rulers were appointed by the kingdoms of Asturias and León. However, Castile later became the dominant force within the Asturias-León-Castile system, ruling over the Kingdom of Asturias-León-Castile until the death of Ferdinand III, when the kingdom dissolved. Although León was effectively controlled by Asturias, Castile retained the title of King of León, held the Crown of León, and its claim to the Kingdom of León was recognized by most nations."

EDG_qadi_authority_reform_desc:0 "A Qadi is an Islamic religious title, historically translated as 'Gazi,' 'Hadi,' 'Ghazi,' or 'Kazi.' Derived from Arabic, it means 'executor of Islamic law,' commonly referred to as a 'religious judge.' This official adjudicates civil, commercial, criminal, and other disputes among Muslim parties based on Islamic law. Qadi judicial authority generally falls into two categories: limited jurisdiction and unlimited jurisdiction. The former only permits adjudication in specific areas (such as marriage, family, inheritance, etc.) or within a designated jurisdiction, while the latter allows handling all types of cases—protecting all lawful actions and penalizing all unlawful ones. Since Qadis enforce 'the limits set by Allah,' only erudite Islamic scholars proficient in scriptures, hadith, and jurisprudence—possessing noble character, integrity, impartiality, sound judgment, and devout faith—are qualified for this role. The responsibilities of a Qadi include adjudicating lawsuits, mediating civil disputes, managing 'waqf' (religious endowments), safeguarding orphans' property, acting as guardians for the legally incapacitated, punishing violators of religious law, and appointing local judicial deputies."

EDG_timariot_domains_reform_desc:0 "The Timar system involved the state granting a portion of state-owned land to meritorious soldiers as compensation for military service. It originated from the Arabic Iqta system of the Umayyad Caliphate and the Byzantine Pronoia system, resembling the Western European fief system in nature but with differences. While Western military fiefs easily became unconditional feudal private property, Timar holdings long retained their conditional nature as land tenure tied to military service. The state exercised strict supervision over these territories. Lords were required to allocate the vast majority of their land to peasants for hereditary cultivation, with arbitrary confiscation prohibited; the land they managed themselves could not exceed the peasants' allotments; except for a strictly defined small portion, the holdings were non-hereditary, and even the hereditary portion remained conditional on military service; the legitimacy of taxes collected by lords and their amounts were subject to oversight by Qadis. These regulations not only restricted the unlimited expansion of lordly lands, allowing the state to periodically reclaim and redistribute portions, but also somewhat adjusted the relationship between peasants and feudal lords. In the empire's early period, lords primarily enriched themselves through war spoils and did not view land as their main income source. They typically limited themselves to collecting rents, acting as political overlords. The cavalry provided by the Timar system was a crucial pillar of the empire's military strength. It spared the state from bearing the majority of military expenses and ensured rapid army mobilization."

EDG_Haseki_reform_desc:0 "The Imperial Harem was a significant power center within the Ottoman court, overseen by the Valide Sultan (Queen Mother). She held absolute authority within the harem and occupied a revered position. At times, the Valide Sultan would intervene in state affairs, using her influence to diminish the Sultan's power. From the early 16th century to the 17th century, the Valide Sultan wielded substantial state authority, a period known as the Sultanate of Women. The harem had its own internal structure and a clear hierarchy. Second only to the Valide Sultan was the Haseki Sultan, the mother of the Sultan's eldest son, who was likely to become the next Valide Sultan. The Sultan also had four wives, known as Haseki Kadins, followed by eight favorites (Ikbals), then other concubines (Gözdes), and lastly the consorts of officials. This vast and sophisticated harem institution provided the empire's rulers with greater possibilities."

EDG_Mahmud_reform_desc:0 "Mahmud II implemented a series of reforms following the decline of the Turks. While eliminating the Janissary corps, he also curbed religious influence and suppressed the Bektashi dervish order, which had close ties to the Janissaries, thereby clearing a preliminary path for reform. Over the next decade or so, the Sultan introduced a series of reform measures: abolishing the outdated military fief (timar) system and reclaiming most fief lands for the state; ending the practice of confiscating criminals' property; establishing ministries modeled on European governments, such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance, with the title of Grand Vizier temporarily changed to Prime Minister; creating a postal system; conducting a nationwide census; founding military academies; issuing official Turkish-language newspapers; and giving some attention to economic issues by setting up committees for agriculture, industry, and commerce. To coordinate reform planning, the Sultan established the Supreme Judicial Council and recalled Mustafa Reshid Pasha, the ambassador to Britain, to draft reform decrees. Mahmud II's reforms served as a prelude to the Tanzimat, laying the groundwork for it."

EDG_Tanqimate_reform_desc:0 "Tanzimat was a reform movement initiated by reformists within the Turkish feudal ruling class to consolidate imperial rule, also known as the 'Reforms of Benevolence.' Objectively, it exhibited capitalist tendencies and was large in scale, covering numerous aspects. It involved reorganizing and strengthening the Supreme Judicial Council established during Mahmud II's time, making it the de facto body leading the reforms. This council was responsible for drafting reform plans, relevant laws, and directives for provincial governors; it could draw conclusions based on governors' reports and administrative complaints; it also adjudicated cases of treason and misconduct by senior officials. Simultaneously, Reshid Pasha and others actively implemented administrative, financial, and other reforms."

EDG_divan_reform_desc:0 "In the early days of the Ottoman Empire, the Sultans were assisted by an informal advisory body composed of nobles and officials. Originating from this body, the Divan, or State Council, emerged as a formal governmental institution, often referred to as the Divan-i Hümayun or Imperial Council. Initially, the Divan served as a court with judicial and appellate functions, fulfilling one of the most critical duties of Near Eastern rulers—dispensing justice. At the same time, the Divan was the highest governmental body and, during wartime, acted as the supreme command headquarters. By the reign of Mehmed II, the Sultans began personally presiding over council meetings, which were typically held near the gate of the Sultan's palace. Hence, terms like 'Kapi' (meaning 'gate') and 'Bâb-i Âli' (meaning 'High Gate') came to refer to the Ottoman imperial government. However, in the 150 years following its establishment, wars were almost constant, so the council convened wherever the Sultan was located. We will now strengthen this institution to enhance the Sultan's boundless authority."

It is one of the earliest forms of commercial partnership, distinct from family-run operations. Under this contract, one party provides capital but does not participate in business activities, while the other utilizes their own equipment and conditions to conduct operations. Profits are distributed according to the amount of capital contributed. The capital provider bears limited liability for operational losses based on their contribution, while the operator bears unlimited liability. This form of joint operation originated in the cities along the Mediterranean coast in medieval Europe. Initially prevalent in maritime trade, capitalists who sought profits without taking personal risks would provide funds, while seafarers transported and sold goods overseas. Profits were shared based on capital contributions. In case of losses, the seafarer bore unlimited liability, while the capitalist bore liability only within the scope of their investment. Later, this partnership form gradually extended to overland trade and eventually evolved into silent partnerships and limited partnerships."

Below the central authority are provinces governed by governors appointed by the Shah. These governors, often capable military commanders, sustain themselves and their provincial administrations through land revenues from their provinces but must remit a fixed proportion of total revenue to the state treasury.

He vigorously overhauled the military, addressing its lax discipline and lack of combat effectiveness: strictly prohibiting commanders at all levels from embezzling the pay of junior officers and soldiers; establishing arms factories, significantly enhancing Persia's military capabilities; reducing the burden on peasants by setting fixed tribute amounts and limiting the arbitrary taxes and forced labor imposed by provincial governors and khans. Since historically oppressed peasants were the main force opposing feudal dynastic rule, appeasing them was crucial for social stability; vigorously reforming finances to increase state revenue; punishing corrupt officials; abolishing the privilege of royal nobles to collect funds and grain from localities. State revenue improved considerably, and local burdens were somewhat alleviated; strengthening centralization by curbing the power of local governors and khans; emphasizing education, establishing the first higher education institution; sending students to Western European countries; permitting the creation of newspapers; encouraging the development of domestic and foreign trade, and supporting the establishment of modern factories. The series of reforms implemented by Nezam led to signs of a revival in Persia: central authority was strengthened, financial conditions improved, peasant burdens were reduced, merchants and industrialists benefited, society tended toward stability, and thus, his measures garnered support from the majority."

However, this new Ghulam corps differed significantly from its predecessors. As the political power of the Qizilbash increased and disputes with this Turkmen group intensified, Abbas established a new military organization for Safavid Iran as a counterbalance—the Ghulam.

EDG_Spanish_cavalry_desc:0 "The Spanish faced Muslims skilled in light cavalry warfare, swift and elusive. Consequently, the armies of the Spanish kingdoms, influenced by Muslim tactics, incorporated many light cavalry and light infantry, with a significant proportion of lightly equipped troops. They often fought with minimal armor, using javelins, demonstrating high mobility and adeptness in mountain warfare, which was unique in Western Europe at the time. This tactical style was vividly displayed at the Battle of Nájera in 1367, which profoundly reflected the combat characteristics of medieval Spanish armies: skilled in light troops and mountain warfare, highly mobile, but also prone to being scattered, lacking strict discipline, and struggling against heavily armored forces."

EDG_Indian_Academy_desc:0 "The West Indian Academy is the general term for the Royal High Councils of the West Indies. It was the highest authority of the Spanish Kingdom overseeing administrative, judicial, and legislative affairs in the Spanish American colonies. It originated in 1493 with the appointment of Queen Isabella's chaplain, Fonseca, as the deputy supervisor of Seville Cathedral, assisting Christopher Columbus in preparing for his second voyage and reporting to the king on matters related to the occupation of the West Indies. Initially established in 1511, it was formally constituted on August 1, 1524, with the approval of King Charles I of Spain. From 1542, it took a permanent form, headquartered in Madrid and directly under the king's jurisdiction. It consisted of a president, a chief justice, eight councilors, a chief prosecutor, and several other high-ranking officials. It held the power to appoint administrative officials and clergy in the Spanish American colonies, oversee financial expenditures, review colonial exploration activities, handle relevant appeal cases, and formulate various laws and regulations. In 1680, it compiled and published the 'Laws of the Indies.' After 1790, it was stripped of many powers and became an advisory body to the king. As an official institution, it ended in April 1812 and was formally abolished in 1834."

EDG_Valladolid_Decree_desc:0 "Influenced by Europe's first standing army from the Middle Ages—the Hungarian Black Army—and the standing army established by neighboring France—the Compagnies d'ordonnance—Spain issued the Decree of Valladolid in 1494. It stipulated that one man would be drafted from every twelve males aged 12 to 45, with the selected serving in military service either domestically or abroad. Of course, due to various factors, the actual enforcement of this decree was quite limited. Nonetheless, these military reforms undoubtedly laid the foundation for the strength of the Spanish regiments in the 15th century."

EDG_Isabella_Reform_desc:0 "Isabella dedicated her life to establishing an absolute monarchy. In 1480, she convened the Cortes in Toledo to comprehensively reform the parliamentary system. Following the reforms, the Cortes saw its powers significantly curtailed; it could only discuss proposals put forward by the Crown, losing its legislative and fiscal authority. It retained only the following rights: announcing and notifying the royal heir; maintaining contact with localities, such as allocating funds for local projects; and allowing representatives to submit petitions on local affairs during sessions. Representatives received some compensation from the Crown in the form of salaries and grants. The Cortes would only be convened when the king deemed it necessary. Through these parliamentary reforms, Isabella weakened the Cortes' power, strengthened royal authority, and consolidated the Crown's dominance."

EDG_Isabella_Reform_2_desc:0 "Isabella also established her own cabinet, which was primarily divided into five departments. The first department specialized in handling affairs between the Kingdom of Castile and rulers of other countries, as well as the Pope; its decisions were binding. Its members mainly included important figures, popular royal advisors, and royal secretaries, and when approval from both monarchs was required, both were included. The second department was solely responsible for judicial matters. Both these departments operated within the Royal Council. The third department, composed of knights and lawyers, specifically managed commercial interactions with Aragon, Catalonia, Sicily, and Valencia. The fourth department consisted of members of the Holy Brotherhood. The final department included Contadores (accountants), city mayors, and officials managing financial and royal property records. These individuals were responsible for assessing the state's annual revenue to plan the following year's agricultural activities, while also recording state expenditures. All five departments were controlled by Isabella's close confidants. In the past, the nobility held significant positions in the Cortes, but that era had passed. Isabella placed greater trust in her own cabinet, which completely replaced the Cortes. Through parliamentary reform and the establishment of her cabinet, Isabella fully controlled the Cortes, turning it into a tool to consolidate her rule. This strengthened centralization and laid the groundwork for later conscription and tax collection during the Reconquista."

EDG_Holy_Brotherhood_Reform_desc:0 "The Catholic Monarchs established a new model of authoritarian monarchy, implementing multiple measures to strengthen royal authority, particularly in Castile. When Isabella ascended the throne of Castile, domestic order was chaotic, with rampant banditry and nobles resorting to war to settle disputes. Castile created a local police agency directly managed by the king to maintain public order, known as the 'Holy Brotherhood.' In 1476, the 'Santa Hermandad,' originally a protective alliance of important cities in Castile, was reorganized into a local police and militia organization, subject to the oversight of the Royal Council. It soon replaced the functions of the weakening Estates-General."

Emir Ibrahim was a bloodthirsty tyrant who took pleasure in watching prisoners stripped of layer after layer of skin before him, enjoying the spectacle while drinking and reveling. Worse still, Ibrahim Ya'qub imposed continuous heavy exactions on the Lebanese region, causing immense suffering among the local populace. Muhammad al-Hariri was a Lebanese officer born among the common people, deeply aware of their hardships. In his youth, he traveled to the Republic of Catalonia, gradually developing a yearning for republican systems and a disdain for autocratic monarchy. He believed republicanism was the best form of government, the only one that could make a government accountable to the people. On a quiet night, Muhammad al-Hariri launched a coup, imprisoned Ibrahim, and founded the Republic of Lebanon."

The Greeks established a fragile Republic of Ankara and imposed a dictatorship on the local Turks. The young Turkish officer Mustafa Kemal seized power in 1442, transforming the Republic of Ankara into a state under Turkish Muslim dictatorship. While Mustafa did not approve of the Greeks, he recognized the political system they created and the nationalist ideology they promoted. Combining this with his emphasis on the military, he reformed the old Greek state structure, establishing a 'Constitutional Court' with the Turkish army at its core as the highest state institution. This turned the nascent Republic of Ankara into a military republic advocating national dictatorship."

In contrast to the Aghas within the court, military commanders were known as external or military Aghas. They represented the Sultan's executive authority, while the Qadis selected from the Ulama represented the Sultan's judicial authority. Under increasing centralization, the provincial divisions within the Ottoman Empire were largely based on military considerations. The entire empire was divided into two halves: Anatolia and Rumelia, each governed by a Beylerbey (Governor-General), both holding the rank of two-tailed Pasha. Anatolia and Rumelia were further subdivided into districts, each managed by a military commander called a Sanjak Bey. Each Sanjak Bey received a banner known as a 'Sanjak,' symbolizing the Sultan's authority. As a one-tailed Pasha, the Sanjak Bey was responsible for summoning and managing the Sultan's armed forces within his jurisdiction, maintaining public order, and ensuring the timely collection of taxes."

EDG_French_High_Court_Reform_desc:0 "The Paris High Court was the supreme court of the Kingdom of France and responsible for promulgating royal decrees. The Chamber of Accounts managed the state's public finances, while the Épargne managed the royal household's revenues and expenditures. The Chancellery handled official documents, and the Secretariat of State managed secretarial affairs within the court government. The Privy Council, formed from specially sworn members of the King's Council, was tasked with handling daily state affairs. Local administration varied between the king's old domains and new territories, managed respectively by bailliage courts and sénéchaussée courts. The king often dispatched itinerant investigating magistrates. Thus, the bureaucratic apparatus under the absolute monarchy began to take systematic and comprehensive shape."

EDG_Villekotley_Decree_desc:0 "Francis I's significant judicial reforms expanded the king's judicial authority. The Decree of Villekotley issued in 1539 required that all judicial documents in every provincial court across the nation be written in French, no longer in Latin or dialects. Additionally, civil cases involving laypersons previously tried by ecclesiastical courts were transferred to royal courts. Francis I concentrated the supreme power of governing the state in the King's Council, with major state events decided by the king and a few close confidants. Regarding the right of 'remonstrance' before registering royal decrees—highly valued by the high courts—Francis I paid little heed; he retained full authority to reject any amendments proposed by the high courts, believing that legislative power belonged solely to him. In 1527, the President of the Paris High Court declared to the king at a session: 'You are above the law; neither laws nor commands can compel you, as there is no power that can force you to do anything.' It was Francis I who first ended royal documents with the phrase 'For such is our pleasure,' later adopted as the standard wording for all subsequent imperial decrees, fully demonstrating that the king's power was absolute and everything depended on his personal will."

EDG_pontifical_Legate_desc:0 "A Papal Legate is the general term for representatives dispatched by the Roman Pope or the Holy See abroad to carry out religious or diplomatic missions.

The first three are sent to countries with diplomatic relations with the Holy See; Apostolic Representatives are sent to countries without formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Papal Legates enjoy special privileges in Catholic nations. Strengthening ties with Papal Legates and influencing Cardinals and the Pope through them can enhance our influence."

EDG_Bologna_religious_agreement_desc:0 "The Bologna Religious Agreement stipulated that high ecclesiastical positions would be nominated by the king and approved by the Pope; if the Pope did not approve, the king could propose another candidate within three months, after which the Pope would make the appointment. Simultaneously, France renounced the principle established by the Council of Basel regarding the superiority of church councils over papal authority, allowing the Pope to receive the first year's revenue from newly appointed bishops (the annates). This agreement resolved conflicts between the Pope and the French Church, granting the king control over high-ranking clergy."

EDG_Nante_edict_desc:0 "The edict guaranteed that no actions taken during the Huguenot Wars would be prosecuted.

EDG_Little_Poller_pardon_desc:0 "The Edict of Little Pol allowed officials to inherit state positions hereditarily upon paying the annual fee for the venal office.

EDG_France_conference_desc:0 "Administratively, Henry IV focused on strengthening central authority.

To enhance control over the provinces, he dispatched 'intendants' to handle violent incidents, ensure tax collection, and investigate grievances that caused public discontent."

EDG_France_Trade_Commission_desc:0 "Henry IV's emphasis on commerce and industry was no less than his focus on agriculture. He established a 'Trade Commission' and appointed Laffemas to lead it. Laffemas vigorously supported manufacturing workshops, encouraging innovation and invention. To protect French goods from being edged out by foreign products and to prevent the outflow of large amounts of currency due to imports, Henry, following Laffemas's advice, advocated for mercantilist policies and protective tariffs, and sought to establish national industries. For instance, previously France had to import Italian silk products. To develop its own silk industry, the state encouraged mulberry cultivation and sericulture, resulting in high-quality French silk products that eventually pushed the Italian silk industry to the brink of bankruptcy. Other handicrafts, such as fine lace, refined leather, and carpets, developed to varying degrees across the country. Henry's abolition of internal tolls invigorated trade among different regions within France."

The most significant manifestation of 'cultural nationalization' was the creation of a series of national cultural institutions, bringing literature, art, science, and other cultural fields under state control. This approach, on one hand, separated writers and artists from private patrons to prevent them from serving as pamphlet writers during religious-political conflicts like the 'Fronde,' helping to eliminate disputes and maintain ideological unity within the kingdom. On the other hand, it harnessed their talents to glorify the monarchy. Louis XIV extensively adopted Richelieu's cultural control strategies.

By recruiting some vagrants and the unemployed into the military, it provided employment for a segment of the homeless while using these individuals to stabilize or suppress others. Simultaneously, impoverished knights gained opportunities to join the mercenary forces to serve the king. Thus, mercenaries enhanced the king's power and weakened the nobility, not only by establishing a formidable armed force capable of enforcing the king's will but also by providing employment for the lesser nobility."

She viewed Parliament as a tool for her rule, believing its role was not to create new laws or waste time on speeches but to allocate funds to fill the treasury. She prohibited Parliament from discussing her policies, restricted its actions, and even expelled members who dared to confront her. To showcase the majesty of the 'earthly God,' she loved extravagant displays, grand banquets, and luxurious attire, yet sought to reduce court expenses by shifting these costs onto ministers and nobles.

These privileges granted Jews autonomy in their distinct communities, independent legal systems, and they were only bound by royal laws concerning Jews and Christians. Among the provisions for Jewish privileges, the most interesting was the permission to purchase stolen goods.

In disputes over succession rights, the assemblies frequently intervened to force consensus and established committees to arbitrate contentious points.\nBroadly, assembly members comprised four major estates: the magnates, who held extensive lands and the legal right to punish wrongdoers; the nobility, with slightly less power and land than the magnates; and representatives of the Church and towns. Each province had its own distinct characteristics. In mid-15th century Carinthia, the assembly included only two noble representatives, while other territories typically had twelve. In Tyrol, the peasant estate was permitted to participate. In Habsburg Lorraine, only townspeople and the lesser nobility could send representatives to the assembly, and so on. Many burghers and peasants ascended to the nobility by purchasing noble properties. Sometimes, multiple provinces convened joint assemblies.

With the rich gold and silver mines of Tyrol as backing, the central treasury could use future coinage revenue as collateral to obtain cash from Augsburg bankers like Fugger and Welser. These high-interest loans temporarily alleviated Maximilian's financial pressures. Given Innsbruck's significant political influence at the time, Maximilian ordered the expansion of a palace there. On one hand, he erected a 'Coat of Arms Tower' adorned with various heraldic emblems, representing the empire's numerous territories in a hierarchical and orderly manner. On the other hand, he oversaw the construction of a loggia overlooking Innsbruck's main square, where Maximilian could comfortably watch various sports competitions and equestrian performances.

Starting from the late 15th century, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian, faced with imperial financial shortages, modeled a new armed force after Swiss mercenaries to achieve his political goals. For nearly half a century from the late 15th century to the 1530s, these soldiers learned and developed new infantry tactics while continuing the Germanic tradition of formidable combat prowess. They once dominated Western European battlefields, becoming a force eagerly sought by European monarchs in the first half of the 16th century. They also earned a reputation as the most peculiarly dressed army in human history. When they marched through the Central European countryside in their bizarre and flamboyant slashed uniforms, carrying pikes and zweihänders, it was a spectacular sight. Their rise, glory, and decline were driven by the objective laws of military development, yet also contained many intriguing stories. A German mercenary regiment typically comprised ten companies.

According to contemporary records, Maximilian could deploy 105 cannons, including iron and bronze guns of various sizes. The Innsbruck arsenal he established became one of Europe's most renowned artillery factories, and the cannons produced there were once considered the finest in all of Western Europe.\nGregor Löffler made significant contributions to the development of the Innsbruck arsenal. In 1513, following in his father Peter's footsteps, he began serving Maximilian. His son, Hans Christoph, later became a leading European gun founder. Löffler was the first master gunsmith to produce weapons on an industrial scale and cast many monumental statues for Maximilian.\nIn addition to the central arsenal in Innsbruck, Maximilian established a series of arsenals to protect his borders: against the Italians at Sigmunds-kron and Trent; against the Swiss at Lindau; against the French at Breisach; against the Hungarians at Vienna; and against the Turks and Venetians at Graz, Hohensalzburg, Laibach, and Gorizia.

To ease class conflicts between peasants and landowners and increase population, the monarchy's government established a 'Reclamation Commission' primarily overseeing the extent of labor services landlords imposed on peasants. In 1775, 1777, and 1778, the government successively issued 'Labor Service Ordinances,' abolishing some provisions of peasant dependency on landlords, setting limits on labor services and rent payments in lieu of service, restricting noble exploitation of peasants, and somewhat alleviating their burdens.

This initiated comprehensive reforms of central and local governing institutions. In 1746, Haugwitz took charge of the reforms. At the central level, the monarchy's government established the 'Directorium in publicis et cameralibus' in 1749, with Haugwitz as its chief minister. Subsequently, during the interval between the end of the War of Austrian Succession and the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, the Directorium's power continuously expanded, even establishing a military affairs and decision-making body—the Court War Council—in 1756. Additionally, it included the Court, State, and House Archives responsible for important documents and certificates, and the Court Deputation for External Affairs managing Banat, Transylvania, and Illyria.

It concluded in 1648 with the signing of the Peace of Westphalia. The treaty granted vast territories to Sweden, France, and their allies; recognized the independence of the Netherlands and Switzerland; confirmed the sovereignty of German princes, strengthened the power of the Imperial Diet, and weakened the emperor's authority. The war and the treaty severely undermined Habsburg dominance, deepened fragmentation within Germany, caused massive population loss, severely damaged agriculture, led to long-term economic decline, and paved the way for French hegemony in Europe. Spain's power declined, while Sweden's strength greatly increased, making it a Nordic power. In religious matters, the treaty stipulated that everyone—including princes and their subjects—had religious freedom, provided they were Catholics, Lutherans, or Reformed Christians (Anabaptists, viewed by many as subversives, were excluded). All ecclesiastical properties held by denominations in 1624 were restored. All those who rebelled against their lords during the Thirty Years' War were granted amnesty—except within the Habsburg hereditary lands. An agreement was reached among Protestant groups: if a lord converted from one Protestant denomination to another, his subjects could not be forced to convert. Thus, the fundamental outcome of the treaty was reconciliation among Protestant factions and a clear demarcation between Protestantism and Catholicism."

For this purpose, the monarchy's government established an 'Immigration Commission,' primarily responsible for settling Protestants, landless peasants, and the homeless (some voluntarily migrating) in sparsely populated regions. At the time, areas within the monarchy needing immigrants fell into several categories: regions originally densely populated, such as Galicia and Transylvania, whose populations decreased due to war, famine, and plague; areas inherently sparsely populated like Lodomeria and Banat, requiring extensive colonization and development; border regions, especially near the Ottoman Empire, where the government needed to increase population to strengthen frontier defense; and finally, settling Germans in places like Hungary to dilute or reduce social unrest. In Austria, immigrants mainly engaged in agriculture, forestry, and mining. However, the immigration policies implemented by Maria Theresa's government significantly increased the monarchy's population, with some regions seeing a tenfold growth. For example, the population of Timișoara in the Banat region rose from 25,000 in 1711 to about 300,000 by 1780. In some areas, it also strongly promoted cultural development, such as a temporary flourishing of Jewish culture in Bukovina, Ukraine."

Maria Theresa, not wanting to fall behind, carried out a series of reforms under this banner. To implement these reforms, she appointed a group of talented ministers who shared her vision. Their emergence and loyalty were key to the success of her rule. Early in her reign, Maria Theresa first appointed Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz to reform internal affairs. Meanwhile, Count Johann Karl von Chotek rebuilt Austria's economy. Subsequently, the rising State Chancellor, Kaunitz, primarily managed Austrian foreign affairs. Although Kaunitz's role focused on diplomacy and his major activities occurred in the later stages of reform, Maria Theresa greatly admired his abilities and formed a close friendship with him, granting him significant influence across government departments. At the time, officials would consult his opinion whenever they encountered difficulties or problems."

Caravan guides were highly paid Berbers, familiar with Saharan conditions and able to ensure the caravan's safety when passing through other nomadic tribes.

Their ideas gained significant traction in Lombardy. While philosophers could not usurp the Visconti family's throne, the duke himself did not mind portraying himself as a philosopher. In 1440, the first 'Philosopher Council' was convened in Lombardy, presided over by the duke himself, with participants including scholars from the Milan Academy and notable figures from various autonomous cities, backed by urban guilds and the merchant class they represented. Meanwhile, since 1414, Filippo had nearly fully restored his father's status. The once opposing alliance of Modena, Ferrara, Montferrat, and Bologna had submitted, and the Republic of Verona became Lombardy's puppet. The Lombard duke's numerous feudal vassals in northern Italy made him a powerful political force that the emperor could not ignore.

EDG_legacy_of_the_safavid_reform_desc:0 "The Safavid Order was the foundation of the Safavid family. Its members, called Khalifas, mainly came from various Qizilbash tribes, some even being tribal emirs themselves. Unlike the Twelver Shi'ite Ulama, Khalifas did not spend time studying the Quran and jurisprudence; they only received specific religious training. Besides the Sheikh himself, only Khalifas had the authority to grant the red hat to others, a symbol of membership in the Safavid Order. Each Qizilbash tribe had a Khalifa responsible for managing order affairs, including proselytizing, conducting rituals, and collecting tithes. Khalifas held immense influence over Qizilbash tribes, and even some tribes outside Iran followed the Safavid Order's commands. Through the order's bonds, all Qizilbash tribes pledged loyalty to the Safavid Sheikh as their spiritual leader. In contrast, order members placed less emphasis on the identity of the King of Kings of Iran. Ismail I attempted to integrate the order into the ruling system of the nascent state, but the results were unsatisfactory. If the monarch was strong, they could bind the Safavid Order to Iran's war chariot. When monarchical power waned, these individuals would mercilessly abandon the state for their own interests. Abbas could not completely abolish the Safavid Order; he could only strengthen control by placing his confidants in various Khalifa positions. To weaken the Safavid Order's religious influence, Abbas vigorously supported Twelver Shi'ism, not only donating large amounts of personal property as waqf but also leading by example, making pilgrimages on foot to various Shi'ite holy sites. With the Shah's political and economic assistance, the Ulama rapidly developed into a new political group. At that time, most Ulama still came from outside Iran, lacking a foundation, so they had to rely on royal authority. They did their utmost to uphold Abbas's legitimacy, combining some Sufi ideas to form the new Isfahan school. Twelver Shi'ism thus gained significant promotion, truly becoming Iran's sole orthodox faith."

Ministers of various departments held real power under the prime minister's leadership, rendering the nobility's power body, the 'Council of State,' nominal. As state financial, diplomatic, and military affairs grew increasingly complex, Richelieu also established two institutions: the Privy Council and the Financial Council.

This prevented traditional feudal forces from being dispersed and acting independently, instead making them a solid foundation in royal strategic planning.\nMercenaries were regulated, with the Empress and the Crown Treasury jointly signing strict employment contracts specifying pay, combat obligations, and reward-punishment mechanisms. Mercenaries were no longer freely roaming bands but controllable forces quickly integrated into regular operational systems, providing mobility and professional combat power during wartime.\nThe standing army was also significantly expanded and professionally trained. Soldiers were directly recruited by the Crown, underwent rigorous training, and maintained strict discipline. They bore the defense of core national interests, served as the main assault force in crucial battles, and undertook key combat tasks under unified military command. The establishment of the standing army gave the kingdom a core force that could be mobilized at any time, rich in combat experience, compensating for the mobility and combat deficiencies of feudal levies and mercenaries."
EDG_LOT_Paladin_participation_desc:0 "The term 'Paladin' originates from 'Palatinus,' meaning 'belonging to the Palatine Hill.' This Latin word in ancient Roman times referred to high-ranking nobles associated with the Palatine Hill, where the Roman imperial palace was located, so 'Palatinus' commonly denoted courtiers serving the Roman emperor and handling military and administrative affairs. Entering the Middle Ages, Charlemagne's twelve most distinguished knights were called the 'Twelve Peers,' meaning 'twelve close attendants,' indicating they were trusted confidants serving the emperor. By the late Carolingian period, especially within the Kingdom of Lotharingia, the number of 'Paladins' continuously expanded, no longer limited to twelve nor synonymous with powerful ministers, evolving into an organization similar to a knightly order. The title of 'Paladin' was conferred by the Carolingian monarch and required ecclesiastical approval, making Paladins both military nobles and clergy—though debates over whether Paladins should uphold celibacy never ceased. Selection criteria for Paladins were stringent: recipients had to be nobles, undergo rigorous military training and religious study, and maintain loyalty to the royal house—precisely why Paladins became a powerful and reliable force within our country."

EDG_LOT_Tax_Bureau_desc:0 "The Tax Bureau is granted powers to regulate markets and supervise foreign trade, ensuring orderly development of the kingdom's commercial activities while maintaining domestic price stability and balancing urban-rural economic relations. The bureau comprises several departments: Tax Administration, Treasury Management, Trade Supervision, and Auditing, each with clear responsibilities and division of labor, enabling the kingdom's fiscal system to operate like clockwork."
EDG_LOT_Frankism_desc:0 "Frankism is a political and cultural current whose core idea is that the European continent should be unified under the leadership of the heirs of the Frankish Empire. This thought is rooted in the political traditions of the Charlemagne era, emphasizing that Frankish royal authority holds not only secular ruling power but also the sacred mission of upholding Christian order. Supporters of Frankism believe that Europe's fragmentation leads to noble fragmentation and frequent wars. If unified governance by heirs of the Frankish Empire were restored, order could be reestablished, central power consolidated, and Christian values and cultural unity promoted. They emphasize historical continuity, viewing the Carolingian Empire as an ideal governance model and hoping to recreate its political structure and influence in modern Europe."
EDG_LOT_Crown_of_Lotharingia_desc:0 "We advocate strong centralization, supporting unified currency and legal systems, and integrating dispersed kingdoms and duchies through military and diplomatic means. Additionally, cultural unification is valued, including promoting Latin education, ecclesiastical institutions, and liturgical norms to strengthen overall European cohesion."
