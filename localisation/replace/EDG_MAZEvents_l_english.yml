EDG_flavor_KRA.1.desc:0 "Since Władysław I unified Poland, the risk of significant fragmentation and separatist rule within the country has remained. His successor, Casimir III, was a brilliant monarch, but he died young after ascending the throne, unable to complete the reforms aimed at curbing the independence-seeking tendencies of the great nobility. Subsequent Polish monarchs also failed in this endeavor.\n\nAfter Władysław III fell in battle at Varna, the Polish throne was left vacant once more as he was unmarried and childless. The only remaining heir was a posthumous son in Austria, merely four years old. If the conflicts among the domestic nobility could be reconciled, perhaps they would elect the Grand Duke of Lithuania as the new king, but Poland now faced even greater divisions.\n\nAs the Hussite Wars expanded, the ideas of Jan Hus spread to southern Poland. Many lesser nobles in Lesser Poland converted to Hussitism, believing it to be the truth people should embrace. After the death of Władysław III, they exploited the power vacuum to overthrow the local magnates, seized control of Lesser Poland, and established a noble republic adhering to Hussitism, with its highest state body named the 'Purification Committee.'\n\nDuke Siemowit III of Greater Poland had long-standing ties with Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. He understood that the Polish kings had been trying to centralize power over the past century, while the autonomy of the Holy Roman Empire's princes was increasingly expanding. Therefore, he aspired to become a West Slavic imperial prince like Bohemia, thus avoiding threats from the Teutonic Order and better facilitating the infiltration of his influence into the Pomerania region. Consequently, Siemowit III refused to submit to the distant court in Krakow and achieved de facto independence.\n\nThe split between northern and southern Poland also fueled separatist tendencies in the Duchy of Mazovia. Thus, the central court in Krakow effectively lost control over most of the country, and the title of King of Poland became an empty one. The throne in Krakow remained nominally vacant; the ruler of Greater Poland had no desire to become the Duke of Krakow; the state based in Sandomierz was a republic. It seemed only the Piast ruler of Mazovia could become the new 'King of Poland.'\n\nIf the Duke of Mazovia is elected as the new nominal 'King of Poland,' Krakow would unite with Mazovia to become the most powerful force in the fractured Polish lands, taking the first step towards the reunification of the Kingdom of Poland.\n\nOf course, this is not the only option. Everyone has their own thoughts and choices."

EDG_MAZEvents.0.name:0 "A Second Union"
EDG_MAZEvents.0.desc:0 "From 1385, when Queen Jadwiga of Poland and Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania signed the agreement establishing the Union of Krewo, until the death of Władysław III at the Battle of Varna, the ties between Poland and Lithuania remained very close. Although relations cooled to an icy low after the death of Vytautas and the two parted ways in 1432, this does not preclude the possibility of a future reunion.\n\nThe Ruthenian civil war in the east is nearing its end, and the internal conflict in northeastern Rus' has concluded swiftly. Faced with the threat of the Rus' people, Poland and Lithuania should unite once again to confront the infidels and various other threats, as they have done in the past."

EDG_MAZEvents.1.desc:0 "In 1385, Vytautas participated in the signing of the Union of Krewo with Poland and was baptized again in 1386 according to the Catholic rite, receiving the baptismal name Alexander. This treaty confirmed the marriage of Jogaila to Queen Jadwiga of Poland and Jogaila's status as King of Poland, also marking the emergence of the Jagiellonian branch of the Gediminid dynasty. After a civil war, Vytautas finally became the regent of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and relations between Poland and Lithuania reached their peak at this time.\n\nHowever, over time, the bonds began to loosen. The Battle of Kiev in 1395 brought relations to a freezing point, fortunately mitigated by Jadwiga's mediation. But after Jadwiga's death in 1399, cracks reappeared in the Polish-Lithuanian union. Although the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 provided some degree of respite for the deteriorating relations, the negative impact of the Battle of Kiev persisted, with no one able to repair it.\n\nUltimately, after many twists and turns, following Vytautas's death, the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania should have reverted to Jogaila for renewed rule. However, the Gediminid branch of Vytautas had long lost patience with Poland. The year after Vytautas's death, they allied with the Radziwiłł family to rise in rebellion and declare independence, crowning Kęstutaitis I of the Gediminids as King of Lithuania in 1431. Upon hearing news of Lithuania's independence, Jogaila, with the support of the Polish nobility, prepared to suppress Lithuania but died on his march to Vilnius. He had witnessed the Polish-Lithuanian union and also its division. After Władysław III was crowned King of Poland, he quickly made peace with Kęstutaitis I and recognized Lithuania's independence. The 46-year union between Poland and Lithuania, established by the Union of Krewo in 1386, finally came to an end.\n\nAlthough the Kingdom of Poland fragmented after the death of Władysław III at Varna, the Duke of Mazovia once again took up the Polish crown. A proposal for union was sent to Vilnius, hoping the two nations could set aside past grievances and restore the union of 1385 to jointly counter the growing ambition and threat of the Rus'."

Influenced by the Renaissance, he sought to establish a new city in his lands in Lublin, planned to be built within his territory, designed from the perspective of facilitating trade and private settlement.\n\nAlthough this city construction plan was proposed by a private individual, if the royal court is willing to extend its assistance, the construction will proceed more smoothly. By gaining its support, a new city will also be obtained to promote the development of Lublin."
