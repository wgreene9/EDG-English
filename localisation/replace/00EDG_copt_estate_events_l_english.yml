EDG_copt_estate_events.1.t:0 "Development of the Copts"
EDG_copt_estate_events.1.d:0 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] have lived on the land of Egypt since ancient times. We had to incorporate them into our government to achieve control over the fertile region of Egypt. Of course, the authority of $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or $ESTATE_CHURCH$ is built upon faith and military strength. Compared to these two, the Copts must labor diligently, expanding their enterprises with wealth as their stake. Recently, however, their endeavors have been progressing very smoothly. Although the [Root.GetCoptsName] lack lofty social status, commerce is, in many respects, the pillar of our national economy. Through their control of currency, the [Root.GetCoptsName] have gradually become a force within our country."
EDG_copt_estate_events.1.a:0 "The influence of the [Root.GetCoptsName] is expanding."

EDG_copt_estate_events.2.t:0 "Emirs Plunder the [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt_estate_events.2.d:0 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] are concerned about the immense influence $ESTATE_NOBLES$ wield within our country. They claim that many lower-ranking nobles disregard state laws, abusing their power to impose unreasonable taxes on land and tolls on traveling merchants. Some are even accused of attacking merchants, seizing wealth through robbery and extortion.\nThe [Root.GetCoptsName], represented by [Root.GetAdjective], now state that our nation's economic development is hindered by these malpractices. Meanwhile, $ESTATE_NOBLES$ argue they are merely exercising their rightful road privileges. Some nobles are also willing to share this income with the state."
EDG_copt_estate_events.2.a:0 "Very well, they are merely exercising their rights."
EDG_copt_estate_events.2.b:0 "We must put a stop to these misdeeds!"

EDG_copt_estate_events.3.t:0 "Decline of the Copts"
EDG_copt_estate_events.3.d:0 "Although the [Root.GetCoptsName] control the wealth of the Nile and numerous guilds in the cities, they lack the ancient privileges and lineage of other factions. Therefore, the status and influence of the [Root.GetCoptsName] are rarely as secure as those of the blue-blooded aristocracy. Many Coptic merchants still face bankruptcy and loss of former power during economic downturns. Recently, unfortunate finances and misguided political ambitions have caused the [Root.GetCoptsName] of [Root.GetName] to lose power and influence; they have forfeited their once-great sway in the cities of Egypt and other regions."
EDG_copt_estate_events.3.a:0 "For the [Root.GetCoptsName], this is as ordinary as sunset."

EDG_copt_estate_events.4.t:1 "[growing_city.GetCapitalName] Demands Privileges"
EDG_copt_estate_events.4.d:1 "In Egypt, the [Root.GetCoptsName] have long been inseparable from administration, commerce, and economy. They occupy vast tracts of land along the Nile and control numerous guilds and workshops in many cities.\nThe [Root.GetCoptsName] of [growing_city.GetCapitalName] recently paid a visit to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], requesting privileges and exemptions from normal taxes to foster the city's development. The [Root.GetCoptsName] promised that if we grant their request, they will ensure the local economy develops rapidly, allowing us to actually acquire more wealth."
EDG_copt_estate_events.4.a:0 "We have always trusted the [Root.GetCoptsName]."
EDG_copt_estate_events.4.b:0 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] have always been cunning."

EDG_copt_estate_events.5.t:0 "Nile River Flooding"
EDG_copt_estate_events.5.d:0 "For a long time, the Nile River valley has been a continuous expanse of cotton fields and fragrant rice paddies. Sandwiched between the Sahara and Arabian deserts, the winding Nile resembles a green corridor, brimming with boundless vitality. However, the Nile is capricious. Although Egyptians have gradually mastered its patterns over thousands of years of history, it always unpredictably causes floods and droughts. And the Nile's fickleness invariably brings famine to Egypt.\nRecently, the Nile has again brought disaster, causing crop failures in the Nile Delta, followed by a food crisis. This famine has rapidly drained the granaries of many major cities in our country. From Cairo to Alexandria, countless victims starve to death daily. For Egypt, this is no longer considered novel, as inevitable as the Nile's flow into the Mediterranean, yet it has still led to domestic unrest.\nStarving common folk blame the traders. Muslims, suffering from hunger, violently attack Coptic merchants on the streets, believing these merchants are profiteering from the opportunity. On the other hand, the [Root.GetCoptsName] argue this is the inevitable result of supply shortages and that there simply isn't enough bread circulating in the market."
EDG_copt_estate_events.5.a:0 "Force merchants to lower prices."
EDG_copt_estate_events.5.b:0 "We should not intervene in these matters."
EDG_copt_estate_events.5.c:0 "We must buy all available bread and distribute it to the people."

EDG_copt_estate_events.6.t:0 "Concurrent Authorities"
EDG_copt_estate_events.6.d:1 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] are not the sole power in the cities. $ESTATE_CHURCH$ arrived later but holds more sway for Muslims. And whenever city councils convene, the [Root.GetCoptsName] often clash with $ESTATE_CHURCH$ due to disagreements.\nThe increasing frequency of such conflicts has led $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to openly flout the rules previously agreed upon by the [Root.GetCoptsName] in their cities. Consequently, numerous representatives from cities controlled by the [Root.GetCoptsName] have come urgently demanding we address this situation."
EDG_copt_estate_events.6.a:0 "Support the [Root.GetCoptsName]."
EDG_copt_estate_events.6.b:0 "Support $ESTATE_CHURCH$."

EDG_copt_estate_events.7.t:0 "Expand [Root.GetCoptsName] Privileges"
EDG_copt_estate_events.7.d:0 "When the [Root.GetCoptsName] consider their importance in state affairs, they feel they are excessively taxed and regulated. Under the Dhimmi system, the [Root.GetCoptsName] are required to pay an additional poll tax, and even their churches are subjected to extra levies, restrictions from which Muslims are free. Therefore, the [Root.GetCoptsName] have proposed to us that we should reduce the taxes demanded of them, and even lower tolls, levies, and various tariffs."
EDG_copt_estate_events.7.a:0 "The Dhimmi system should be more lenient."
EDG_copt_estate_events.7.b:0 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] need to recognize their place!"

EDG_copt_estate_events.8.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Discontent with Trade Policy"
EDG_copt_estate_events.8.d:0 "Due to the restrictive trade policies we have enacted against other nations, the interests of prominent merchant groups have been damaged. The [Root.GetCoptsName] estate, which supports these major families, requests that we at least relax the trade embargos to compensate for their loss of income."
EDG_copt_estate_events.8.a:0 "We must support the [Root.GetCoptsName]."
EDG_copt_estate_events.8.b:0 "Our nation's commercial policy will not change due to [Root.GetCoptsName] intervention."

EDG_copt_estate_events.9.t:0 "Cottage Industry"
EDG_copt_estate_events.9.d:1 "Economic development is always full of competition, and this is especially true for Egypt's many artisans. The [Root.GetCoptsName], who have lived along the banks of the Nile for thousands of years, have long mastered ancient and stable production techniques, giving rise to a greedy merchant class. Wealthy Coptic merchants are attempting to bypass guild restrictions by outsourcing production to cottage industries outside the cities. In fact, this outsourcing system is a highly profitable strategy, but it has angered the guild craftsmen within the cities. They feel their ancient rights are being violated, and their carefully regulated prices are under attack. The [Root.GetCoptsName] believe they certainly have the right to eradicate external competition, but the guild craftsmen of [Root.GetAdjective] are now petitioning the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to protect their privileges."
EDG_copt_estate_events.9.a:0 "We cannot halt this progress."
EDG_copt_estate_events.9.b:0 "We must protect the guilds' privileges."

EDG_copt_estate_events.10.t:0 "Social Mobility"
EDG_copt_estate_events.10.d:0 "The growing power of the [Root.GetCoptsName] has prompted individuals from this estate to seek livelihoods in places traditionally dominated by other groups or classes. Even children from middle- and lower-class Coptic families, receiving good education and matching ambitions, are gradually catching up in ability to the old privileged classes. Consequently, they are displacing the privileged, increasingly occupying positions such as government officials, lawyers, and administrators. The [Root.GetCoptsName] still feel overly constrained by the privileges of the previous era, while those privileged classes are deeply weary of this 'unnatural' social mobility.\nUnless we do something, we may lose the support of the privileged classes; but if we withdraw our support from the [Root.GetCoptsName] now, it could have a severe impact on our relationship with them."
EDG_copt_estate_events.10.a:0 "We cannot hinder the development of the emerging class."
EDG_copt_estate_events.10.b:0 "We must protect the vested rights of the privileged classes."

EDG_copt_estate_events.11.t:0 "Cities of the [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt_estate_events.11.d:0 "With the expansion of [Root.GetAdjective], the [Root.GetCoptsName] are no longer confined to the Nile but have arrived on new lands. Our cooperative policies with the [Root.GetCoptsName] have successfully yielded economic results in many areas. A large number of [Root.GetCoptsName] have flooded into recently conquered cities, dominating the local economies. These cities, led by the [Root.GetCoptsName], are flourishing, and our influence in international trade is rapidly growing."
EDG_copt_estate_events.11.a:0 "Excellent."

EDG_copt_estate_events.12.t:0 "Trade Risks"
EDG_copt_estate_events.12.d:0 "Long-distance trade requires seeking profit amidst danger; weather and pirates are no less a threat than those on land. Usually, the [Root.GetCoptsName] can handle a series of accidents and protect themselves and their goods in their own way. However, recently, a large number of merchants are facing the risk of bankruptcy. Perhaps we should provide them with some economic compensation to get their businesses back on track."
EDG_copt_estate_events.12.a:0 "Compensate those merchants."
EDG_copt_estate_events.12.b:0 "They should understand the risks."

EDG_copt_estate_events.13.t:0 "Urbanization"
EDG_copt_estate_events.13.d:0 "The increasing prosperity of the [Root.GetCoptsName] estate is attracting more and more rural people into cities that originally had low population proportions. Some cities are developing rapidly, but this is accompanied by issues like poor sanitation and overcrowding, which pose difficulties and even disasters for the [Root.GetCoptsName]. The poor live outside the city walls, and squalid suburbs have seen outbreaks of disease.\nThe [Root.GetCoptsName] find this situation intolerable and demand the state provide further resource assistance and strengthen management beyond the city walls. Only by doing so can urbanization bring positive effects."
EDG_copt_estate_events.13.a:0 "Try to improve the urban conditions."
EDG_copt_estate_events.13.b:0 "It's not a big deal; the [Root.GetCoptsName] can handle it themselves."

EDG_copt_estate_events.14.t:0 "Economic Policy"
EDG_copt_estate_events.14.d:0 "As the power of the [Root.GetCoptsName] grows, their demands for reduced government control and lower taxes are becoming more frequent. Many believe our nation's commercial policies are outdated and oppressive, and if this continues, tolls and taxes will decrease as a result."
EDG_copt_estate_events.14.a:0 "Weaken mercantilism."
EDG_copt_estate_events.14.b:0 "Refuse to change trade policies."

EDG_copt_estate_events.15.t:0 "Protests Among the [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt_estate_events.15.d:0 "The deteriorating relations between the state and the [Root.GetCoptsName] have reached a breaking point, to the extent that in major cities, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is fundamentally distrusted. Every state initiative is suspected of aiming to curb the power of the [Root.GetCoptsName], and tax evasion has become commonplace.\nNow, some guilds have begun large-scale strikes, demanding greater autonomy and freedom."
EDG_copt_estate_events.15.a:0 "Preposterous!"
EDG_copt_estate_events.15.b:0 "Accept their demands."

EDG_copt_estate_events.16.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Rebellion in [Root.GetName]"
EDG_copt_estate_events.16.d:0 "Terrified by the loss of their rights and interests, the [Root.GetCoptsName] in the province of [Root.GetName] have taken up arms against us!"
EDG_copt_estate_events.16.a:0 "Very well."

EDG_copt_estate_events.17.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Wavering Loyalty"
EDG_copt_estate_events.17.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. The once very warm relationship with the [Root.GetCoptsName] has grown increasingly cold. We must quickly establish a new agreement with the leaders of the [Root.GetCoptsName] to maintain their loyalty."
EDG_copt_estate_events.17.a:0 "Agreed."



EDG_copt2_estate_events.1.t:0 "An Overzealous Qadi"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.1.d:0 "A Qadi (Islamic judge) in one of our major cities has been using his influence to interpret Islamic law and the decrees issued by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], albeit rather zealously. Not content with maintaining the status quo in predominantly non-Muslim cities, he has been actively attempting to force unbelievers to convert while systematically closing their places of worship.\nRecently, after a forcibly converted [Root.GetCoptsName] committed suicide, large numbers of [Root.GetCoptsName] are now collectively leaving the city to settle in more welcoming places. Moreover, even $ESTATE_CHURCH$ largely seems to find these actions too extreme and may consider taking steps to stop this increasingly aggressive Qadi."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.1.a:0 "Support this Qadi."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.1.b:0 "We must maintain cooperation with the [Root.GetCoptsName]."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.2.t:0 "Demand to Reduce Taxes on the [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.2.d:0 "As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was proceeding to the royal mosque for the weekly procession, a large crowd of [Root.GetCoptsName] gathered in front of the building, blocking the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s path. They demanded a reduction in certain discriminatory taxes against non-Muslims, such as taxes on temples or pilgrimages."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.2.a:0 "Trample over them!"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.2.b:0 "Exempt those taxes!"

EDG_copt2_estate_events.3.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Officials"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.3.d:0 "Over the past few years, the [Root.GetCoptsName] in our country have become increasingly influential, though not everyone likes this. Even in our more important trade guilds, the presence of these [Root.GetCoptsName] is frequently seen. Many of them serve as administrative officials in our provinces or are allowed to retain their honorary titles."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.3.a:0 "Very well."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.4.t:0 "Decline of the [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.4.d:0 "Although the [Root.GetCoptsName] community is an important part of our society, they have recently been severely disadvantaged by other estates. They are frequently required to fulfill various government duties, forced to pay discriminatory taxes, and often face malicious obstruction in business from Muslim merchants."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.4.a:0 "Very well."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.5.t:0 "The [Root.GetCoptsName] and $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.5.d:0 "Many Muslim $ESTATE_NOBLES$ denounce and complain that our government is not equal or just but rather favors infidels. With the support of $ESTATE_CHURCH$, they now claim that our nation is violating established Islamic traditions and customs. We must ensure infidels are kept away from politically influential positions.\nIn a province dominated by the [Root.GetCoptsName], the local Copts and merchants fully funded the construction of a brand-new sanctuary. This has only intensified the situation. $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and $ESTATE_NOBLES$ are demanding we demolish this sanctuary and drive the [Root.GetCoptsName] back to their proper place."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.5.a:0 "We must heed the opinion of $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.5.b:0 "Support the [Root.GetCoptsName]."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.6.t:0 "Administrators with [Root.GetCoptsName] Background"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.6.d:0 "Traditionally, the [Root.GetCoptsName] have been excluded from high-level administrative positions, which are instead filled by devout Muslim scribes. However, the [Root.GetCoptsName] have lived on this land for thousands of years, and their understanding of administrative structures should not be overlooked. Our governmental institutions have developed so rapidly that a large number of positions have become vacant, offering many talented individuals from the [Root.GetCoptsName] estate opportunities to showcase their abilities. Although some may consider this an unorthodox move, recruiting them could bring us many benefits."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.6.a:0 "Let's make good use of these [Root.GetCoptsName]."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.6.b:0 "We cannot risk their assimilation capabilities."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.7.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Bandits"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.7.d:0 "As relations between the state and the [Root.GetCoptsName] deteriorate sharply, trust has completely collapsed in some areas. Tax collectors spread rumors that a convoy transporting tax money even vanished within Dhimmi territory. In some cities, [Root.GetCoptsName] leaders are even engaging in fierce confrontations with the clergy and inciting opposition against us. Not only are they concealing everything within the city walls, but the [Root.GetCoptsName] are also questioning our nation's governance capabilities."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.7.a:0 "Damnable infidel liars!"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.7.b:0 "Make concessions to ease the situation."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.8.t:0 "Wealthy [Root.GetCoptsName]"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.8.d:0 "In the lands of [Root.GetName], the [Root.GetCoptsName] wield immense influence. They control vast tracts of land in Egypt and many emerging industrial and commercial cities. A large portion of social wealth remains in the hands of the [Root.GetCoptsName], and no laws prohibit them from participating in investments or lending."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.8.a:0 "Persuade these [Root.GetCoptsName] to invest in the fiscal recovery plan."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.8.b:0 "We cannot make ourselves dependent on infidels."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.9.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Uprising in [Root.GetName]"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.9.d:0 "Desperate over the loss of their privileges, the Dhimmis of [Root.GetName] have taken up arms against us!"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.9.a:0 "Very well."

EDG_copt2_estate_events.10.t:0 "[Root.GetCoptsName] Wavering Loyalty"
EDG_copt2_estate_events.10.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers increase and some of their leaders age, the once-friendly relationship between the [Root.GetCoptsName] and us has grown cold. We need to reach an agreement with the current [Root.GetCoptsName] leaders to ensure their loyalty."
EDG_copt2_estate_events.10.a:0 "Agreed."
