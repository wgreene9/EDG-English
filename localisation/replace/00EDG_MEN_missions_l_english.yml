EDG_MEN_1_2_title:0 "Regroup and Rebuild"
EDG_MEN_1_2_desc:0 "Before the Ottomans and Bulgarians attack, there is little time left to prepare. For that elusive dream of Rome, Ilyas III, after years of wasted time, is determined to regroup and rebuild."

EDG_MEN_1_3_title:0 "Learn from Our Friends"
EDG_MEN_1_3_desc:0 "Those willing to fight for the revival of Rome are our allies. Befriend them and jointly build a defensive line against Rome's enemies."

EDG_MEN_1_5_title:0 "Economic Development"
EDG_MEN_1_5_desc:0 "After 1204, successive emperors turned our markets into prized assets for Latin merchants, granting them various privileges and even exempting them from the 'Kommerkion'—the 10% tariff on goods arriving in Constantinople. These measures have had lasting detrimental effects, destroying our merchants' trust and leaving them at a disadvantage in competition. We must reclaim those markets."

EDG_MEN_1_7_title:0 "Commercial Relations"
EDG_MEN_1_7_desc:0 "Rome has regained control of Eastern trade; thus, we must ensure the trade routes remain unobstructed. Greedy barbarians always covet these lands; we need new trade partners."

EDG_MEN_2_2_desc:0 "On the same side of the Aegean, [318.GetName] is home to a group of Greeks who claim to have been abandoned. We share similar circumstances. They possess excellent maritime skills and ideals close to ours, but we must tell them—Rome is not dead!"

EDG_MEN_2_4_title:0 "Trade with a Sword"
EDG_MEN_2_4_desc:0 "The Akhi Brotherhood does not shun trading with infidels. Exploited for their trade value by the Ottomans for years, their longstanding grievances make them a sharp blade we can wield against the Ottoman states."

EDG_MEN_2_6_title:0 "Blinded by Mercy"
EDG_MEN_2_6_desc:0 "The Bulgarians have no respect for Rome. They covet Konstantiniyye, audaciously seeking to usurp the Basileus's throne. We shall emulate Emperor Basil II, punishing these rebels and burying their ambitions."

EDG_MEN_3_1_title:0 "Awakening from a Dream"
EDG_MEN_3_1_desc:0 "Ilyas III has ruled Mentese for over thirty years, yet Mentese has always remained confined to a corner of Anatolia. A visitor from Constantinople might bring about new changes."

EDG_MEN_3_5_title:0 "A Poor Steed's Perseverance"
EDG_MEN_3_5_desc:0 "The ambitions of the ruler of Rumelia are known to all, and he indeed possesses strength matching those ambitions. Powerful like a steed, while we are but nags. Though not advantaged, we can still fight them with all our might. A fine steed cannot cover ten paces in one leap; a poor steed, persisting for ten stages, achieves success through perseverance!"
EDG_MEN_mission_3_5_tt:0 "§GEvent Preview:§!\n@MHM Rumelia will be annexed by us. Both we and the Basileus will receive a certain amount of gold and monarch points."

EDG_MEN_4_4_title:0 "Negotiating with a Tiger"
EDG_MEN_4_4_desc:0 "The return of Morea allows Roman influence to smoothly extend westward. However, expecting the Latins to willingly withdraw from the Aegean is wishful thinking. It's time to take action and drive them out."

EDG_MEN_4_8_title:0 "Sea Fire"
EDG_MEN_4_8_desc:0 "Greek fire is one of Rome's most significant innovations, known by various names among the Greeks. It refers to an incendiary substance that could be projected onto enemy ships and ignited, similar to an early flamethrower.

EDG_MEN_5_5_title:0 "Naval Endeavor"
EDG_MEN_5_5_desc:0 "The decline of the Dromon, the dominance of the Latin Galea, and Rome's reliance on naval support from various Latin republics have all combined to render Rome's maritime power barely existent.
