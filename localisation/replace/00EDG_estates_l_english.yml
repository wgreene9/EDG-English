The immense wealth accumulated through Mediterranean trade made it not only economically feasible for Italian states to recruit 'professional soldiers,' but it also freed the citizens of city-states from military obligations, allowing them to fully exploit their comparative advantages in trade, commerce, craftsmanship, and finance. While armies composed of militias and knights did achieve victories, their mobilization was slow, service time was limited, and military quality was uneven. Mercenaries, however, could be deployed at any time and possessed rich combat experience. Militias often struggled against the charge of heavy cavalry, whereas mercenary infantry, with their practical experience and good coordination, proved capable of defeating heavy cavalry."

#Paladins
estate_edg_paladin:0 "Paladins"
estate_edg_paladin_desc:0 "Paladin, whose root is derived from 'Palatinus,' meaning 'of the Palatine Hill' in Latin. This Latin word in ancient Roman times referred to high officials and nobles associated with the Palatine Hill. As this hill was the site of the Roman imperial palace, 'Palatinus' was also commonly used to denote courtiers who served the Roman Emperor and handled his military and administrative affairs. Entering the Middle Ages, Charlemagne's twelve most distinguished knights were called the 'Twelve Peers,' signifying 'twelve close attendants,' indicating they were the emperor's trusted confidants. In the later Carolingian period, especially within the Kingdom of Lotharingia, the number of 'Paladins' expanded, no longer limited to twelve or synonymous with powerful ministers. It evolved into an organization akin to a knightly order. The status of 'Paladin' was conferred by the Carolingian monarch and required ecclesiastical recognition, making Paladins both military nobility and clergy—though debates over whether Paladins should uphold celibacy never ceased. The selection criteria for Paladins were stringent; recipients of the Paladin title had to be nobles, having undergone rigorous military training and religious study, and remain loyal to the crown—precisely why Paladins have become a powerful and reliable force within our country."
