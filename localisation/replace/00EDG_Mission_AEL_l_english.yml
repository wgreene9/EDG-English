EDG_AEL_mission_1_2_desc:0 "Our great Kingdom of Arles has endured for over two centuries since the failure of the false crusade by the lackeys of the false pope. However, our nation shall never rest content here. Before proceeding further, we have much work to do. Stabilizing the country's political situation is a necessary preparation for future actions."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_3_title:0 "The Council of Aix"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_3_desc:0 "As the number of True Believers gradually increases, it is necessary for us to further standardize and manage our faithful. We must convene our first council—the Eighth Ecumenical Council of the Orthodox Faith—in our holy city of Aix to discuss ecclesiastical affairs and establish doctrinal order."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_4_title:0 "Greater Provençalism"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_4_desc:0 "Greater Provençalism envisions a powerful state encompassing Southern France and Northeastern Iberia. We can unite with our Cathar brethren in Catalonia, who share our language and uphold our doctrine, making them our natural allies. For the sake of our mission, we should establish deeper relations with them. Greater Provence must be bound closely together."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_5_title:0 "Integrate Valencia"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_5_desc:0 "Our crusade has achieved initial victories in Iberia, and our True Faith is gradually spreading in the hearts of the Iberian people. Without a doubt, in time, Iberia will ultimately return to the leadership of the True Faith and be embraced once more by God."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_7_title:0 "The Iberian Flame"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_7_desc:0 "Since the Battle of Covadonga in 718, the flames of war in Iberia have never been extinguished. Followers of the false god and the wicked Muslims have battled incessantly across this land. Now, under the leadership of our wise king and enlightened church, we can proudly declare that the wars of Iberia have drawn to a close. We have ended the conflagration of the peninsula."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_10_title:0 "Iron Curtain of Blessedness" # The Iron Curtain of Blessedness
EDG_AEL_mission_1_10_desc:0 "From Lisbon in Iberia to Burgundy in France, an iron curtain has descended across Western Europe. Behind this line lie the capitals of the ancient states of the West. London, Paris, Rome—all these cities and their inhabitants are encompassed within the grace of the All-Blessed God. Not only have they embraced our True Faith in one way or another, but all their people have willingly gathered under the banner of our Church."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_12_title:0 "Narbonne Wine"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_12_desc:0 "In the past, only the wines of Burgundy and Champagne were renowned throughout the world. Yet our King of Arles has shown the world that with devout faith and a spirit of determined struggle, Southern France can also produce fine wine. Today, the wine of Narbonne is sold far and wide across Europe, even gracing the tables of the distant Kievan Rus'."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_13_title:0 "Bordeaux Winery"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_13_desc:0 "Bordeaux, currently the world's largest wine-producing region. Its pleasant climate yields exquisite wine quality. As grapes from across the nation are sent to Bordeaux for processing, it is necessary for us to establish a winery to centrally manage Bordeaux's wine affairs."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_14_title:0 "Mediterranean Wine Empire"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_14_desc:0 "With the flourishing wine industries of Southern France and Northern Italy, our nation has essentially monopolized wine production across the entire Mediterranean region. Without a doubt, our country has become the wine empire of the Mediterranean."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_16_title:0 "Arlesian Officer Corps"
EDG_AEL_mission_1_16_desc:0 "At the founding of Arles, its troops consisted largely of local peasants and basic militia. While it is true that our True Faith inspired high morale and fierce combativeness in these peasants, a lack of organization and unified command still posed challenges. However, as our military development progresses and the officer corps is gradually perfected, these problems will be readily resolved."

EDG_AEL_mission_1_18_title:0 "Ordonnance Cavalry" # The Ordonnance Cavalry
EDG_AEL_mission_1_18_desc:0 "Cavalry is crucial within a nation's armed forces. Elite cavalry can effortlessly breach enemy formations, sow panic, and inflict massive casualties. In 1283, the King of Arles authorized the establishment of the Ordonnance Cavalry. This unit became renowned for its military discipline and loyalty solely to the Emperor. Its reputation spread across the European continent, striking fear into the hearts of its foes."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_1_title:0 "Stabilize the Kingdom"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_1_desc:0 "Our great Kingdom of Arles has endured for over two centuries since the failure of the false crusade by the lackeys of the false pope. However, our nation shall never rest content here. Before proceeding further, we have much work to do. Stabilizing the country's political situation is a necessary preparation for future actions."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_3_title:0 "Pacify the Vassals"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_3_desc:0 "Some vassals of the kingdom, emboldened by foreign powers, have become restless and seek to slip from our grasp. It is time to offer some 'sweet dates' to calm their ambitions. This will ensure that our future missionary efforts proceed without a hitch."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_4_title:0 "Armed Mission"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_4_desc:0 "We have never wished to use force, yet we will never renounce it. For over two hundred years, the heretics have schemed ceaselessly, attempting to subjugate us with horse and sword. Now, it is time for them to taste our wrath. It is time to launch our Crusade!"

EDG_AEL_mission_2_5_title:0 "Abolish Francia"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_5_desc:0 "The northern kingdom has clung to a precarious existence for over two hundred years after the failure of their false crusade. Now, it is time for us to end this once and for all. We shall settle the grievances of the previous crusade with a new one—but this time, our iron hooves shall trample across the enemy's lands."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_6_title:0 "Unify West Francia"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_6_desc:0 "As our territories gradually expand, we have restored the glory of old. Without a doubt, we can now claim that we have inherited the legacy of West Francia. It is time for the people of West Francia to unite under a single banner."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_7_title:0 "Religion in West Francia" # The State Religion of West Francia
EDG_AEL_mission_2_7_desc:0 "With the gradual shift in the faith of our people, our True Faith has gained increasing support and allegiance. We must rightfully proclaim Catharism as our state religion. The true faith deserves to be proclaimed and spread."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_8_title:0 "Restore Middle Francia"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_8_desc:0 "Let us look again upon our realm, from Friesland in the north to Lombardy in the south. Everywhere, the hymns of prayer to our true God are sung. There is no doubt: we can proclaim to the world that we are the legitimate successors of the Kingdom of Middle Francia."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_9_title:0 "King of All Franks"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_9_desc:0 "Francia—a name both familiar and strange. It is the one in bedtime stories parents tell their children; it is the one children vie to role-play in their games of knights; it is the one hanging on the outer walls of ruined castles. We have always read the chronicles, dreaming of Francia's glorious past, of the clarity and prosperity under the rule of Charlemagne. But now, we need not dream of the future; we need only live in the present. We know that Francia, our Francia, has returned."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_10_title:0 "Rule Britannia"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_10_desc:0 "Since the fall of the Roman Empire, the people of Britain have been separated from the European mainland. Now, under the leadership of our great Church, the British people have embraced the continent once more. Their devotion to the True Faith signifies that we have truly integrated Britain's blood and bone into our own being, that the people of Britain stand wholeheartedly with us."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_11_title:0 "The Trading Port of Toulon"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_11_desc:0 "Situated on the northern shore of the Mediterranean, the port of Toulon is a vital harbor in the French region. Since the Cathar armies formally assumed control of Toulon, the port has grown increasingly prosperous alongside the expansion of our faith. Now, dockworkers labor busily day after day, and tens of thousands of sailing ships come and go in the harbor—a scene of flourishing vitality."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_13_title:0 "The French Wine Guild" # The Southern French Wine Guild
EDG_AEL_mission_2_13_desc:0 "With the establishment of the unified wine organization, the 'Southern French Wine Guild,' wine production in our country has become increasingly standardized. Bottle after bottle of wine is produced, and the wine industry of Southern France is thriving."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_15_title:0 "Large-Scale Agriculture" # Large-Scale Farm Production
EDG_AEL_mission_2_15_desc:0 "As our territories are gradually consolidated, it is necessary to integrate small-scale subsistence farms to improve the efficiency of our agricultural production. With the widespread adoption of large-scale farming, our grain output and the specialization level of our food industry have seen a significant increase."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_17_title:0 "Military Privy Council"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_17_desc:0 "To achieve better military expansion, we must undertake sound military reforms. We should establish a Military Privy Council, employ numerous military advisors to provide professional strategic counsel, and elevate the training standards of our troops."

EDG_AEL_mission_2_19_title:0 "Form the Royal Army"
EDG_AEL_mission_2_19_desc:0 "Our forces have long relied on a conscription system. The quality of troops obtained this way is subpar, and their equipment is lacking. We should form a standing, direct Royal Army. On one hand, this will help us restrain the princes; on the other, it will better serve our campaigns of conquest."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_2_title:0 "Gospel on the Other Shore" # Preach the Gospel on the Other Shore
EDG_AEL_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The followers of the false god would never imagine that we have already driven a wedge into the southern edge of their illegitimate territories. When the time is right, the True Believers in Capua will utterly expel the forces of the false god from their lands, and our reach shall extend even farther."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_3_title:0 "Newly Born Brethren"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_3_desc:0 "As more and more brethren convert to the True Faith, our belief grows ever stronger. It is time for the brothers of Arles to take action and bathe in the holy light of God."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_5_title:0 "The Lombard Iron Crown"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_5_desc:0 "Lombardy—a fine choice for a crusade. It is an Imperial Elector, yet close enough to us. When our iron hooves trample across the territory of the Lombard Kingdom and we seize their Iron Crown, it will surely deliver a great shock to the false Emperor. It will also let the followers of the false god know—we are coming, are you ready?"

EDG_AEL_mission_3_7_title:0 "King of Italy"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_7_desc:0 "Our territories in Northern Italy are like a sharp dagger, thrust deep into the lands ruled by the Empire and the false Pope. Now, it is time to crown ourselves King of Italy. We shall unify all of Northern Italy, pushing right up to the Pope's doorstep."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_11_title:0 "The Rhône Estuary"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_11_desc:0 "The Rhône River, the mother river that has nourished Southern France for millennia. From the first Gallic tribe establishing a settlement along the Rhône to the new royal court of Aix in the rising Kingdom of Arles, the river has carried history, flowing southward. Today, a modern river transport network has been established along the entire Rhône."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_12_title:0 "The Court of Aix"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_12_desc:0 "Nearly two hundred years have passed since the royal court of Aix was established amidst storm and strife. In these two centuries of turbulent change, the world has been utterly transformed. Yet, however complex and chaotic the world's changes, our royal court has remained steadfast, unmoved by wind and wave, seated firmly in its position."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_14_title:0 "Royal Trade Office"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_14_desc:0 "Given the continuous development of our nation's economy and trade, we should establish a unified institution to centrally manage trade affairs and resolve trade disputes. We must approve the creation of the Royal Trade Office for standardized administration."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_15_title:0 "Arles National Bank"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_15_desc:0 "As our nation's finance and trade gradually develop, it is necessary for us to systematically and institutionally incorporate our banking sector into a regulatory framework. To this end, we should establish the Arles National Bank to manage the nation's financial affairs."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_16_title:0 "Frankish Finances" # Frankish Financial System
EDG_AEL_mission_3_16_desc:0 "With our trade hegemony in Europe gradually established, our merchants are found along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and even the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Merchant ships dot the seas like islands, forming a vital lifeline for our nation. The Frankish trade and financial system has now supplanted that of Venice, Genoa, and others, nourishing the very flesh and bone of all Europe."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_18_title:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_18_desc:0 "After successive Cathar kings steadily centralized power, the Kingdom of Arles in the 15th century established a highly efficient system of absolute monarchy. The King could understand the full state of the nation through multiple channels, and if anomalies arose, could easily mobilize large armies to deal with them centrally."

EDG_AEL_mission_3_20_title:0 "L'État, c'est moi"
EDG_AEL_mission_3_20_desc:0 "God save the King! God save Arles! Our King, our eternal savior! Our King, our benevolent sage! Our King, our pure believer! Our King, our great leader!"

EDG_AEL_mission_4_1_title:0 "Consolidate the Faith"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_1_desc:0 "Although our nation has largely converted to the True Faith, there remain some stubborn holdouts who secretly cling to their false beliefs, hoping for the return of their false king and false pope. We should continue to support our newly established pontificate to further the people's enlightenment."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_3_title:0 "The Church of Avignon"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_3_desc:0 "Since the 13th century, Avignon has gradually developed into another religious center of our nation alongside Aix. With the ongoing restoration and expansion of the Church of Avignon, it has attracted an increasing number of pilgrims. The scale of the Avignon church is now incomparable to its original state."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_4_title:0 "Peaceful Mission"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_4_desc:0 "We believe not everyone is stubbornly set in their ways. We also hope that some may join our ranks. After years of development, our Church has captured the world's attention. Now is the time to engage with those of vision; the True Faith must be spread."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_5_title:0 "Infiltrate the Empire" # Infiltrate the Holy Roman Empire
EDG_AEL_mission_4_5_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Emperor's control over the Empire has become nominal. Perhaps this is a fine opportunity for us. When the Emperor sees some princes covertly or openly converting to our faith, powerless to stop them, his expression will surely be quite a sight."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_6_title:0 "Defender of the Faith"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_6_desc:0 "The great King, the great Pope, and the great Church protect every subject bathed in the True Faith. We have shown the world the unprecedented unity of our order, and we have shown the world the true glory of God. Without a doubt, the defender of our faith is our great King."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_7_title:0 "End Catholic Authority" # Dismantle Catholic Authority
EDG_AEL_mission_4_7_desc:0 "Since the First Council, the Bishop of Rome has gradually usurped a status not rightfully his. The so-called Pope in Rome is merely a skin the Bishop of Rome has draped over himself. As our faith expands, it is time to tear away the disguise of the false pope."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_8_title:0 "Dissolve the Roman Curia"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_8_desc:0 "How long has the Roman Curia existed? It seems so long that we have lost track of time. It appears as if it were there at the world's creation, as if the world should operate this way, as if the Church should revere Rome as its master—so natural. We shall tell the world that nothing is born this way, nothing is inherently destined to be so. Rome's special status is not what it should have, nor does it have the right to retain it. The Bishop of Rome and the Roman Church shall return to their proper place."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_9_title:0 "The Cathar Empire"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_9_desc:0 "As our faith gradually infiltrates, more and more princes are beginning to embrace Catharism. The Imperial Emperor likely can no longer stem our tide. Without a doubt, the Holy Roman Empire will become the world's first empire to adopt Catharism as its official faith. This will be a monumental victory for us."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_10_title:0 "The Supreme Gospel"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_10_desc:0 "Looking back, the seed of Catharism sprouted in Southern France. Through countless trials and tribulations, it finally, after immense hardship, shattered the malicious attempts of the false god and his evil followers to besiege us. Subsequently, we spread the glory of the All-Blessed God across the entire continent. With the so-called 'Roman Catholic Church' retreating step by step across Europe, by the Lord's grace, our faith now truly rules over all of Western Europe. We are bathed in the supreme gospel."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_11_title:0 "The Savoy Guilds"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_11_desc:0 "The factory production in the Savoy region has long been at the forefront within our nation. As our regime grows increasingly prosperous, Savoy has effectively become the industrial heart of our country. The guilds of Savoy are flourishing; the sounds of hammers, chainsaws, and picks in both Upper and Lower Savoy not only sustain our entire national military but also provide the people with high-quality products."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_13_title:0 "The Genoa Office"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_13_desc:0 "Since the days of the Republic of Genoa, Genoa has always been the most prosperous area in the Mediterranean. With our stabilization of the situation in Genoa, it is necessary for us to establish a unified office here to manage local trade affairs."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_15_title:0 "Modern Management" # Modern Industrial Management
EDG_AEL_mission_4_15_desc:0 "As large-scale factory production flourishes across our nation, we have gradually established an efficient system of modern industrial management. Our nation's level of industrialization now significantly leads the world."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_17_title:0 "The Royal Cabinet"
EDG_AEL_mission_4_17_desc:0 "Our great King has come to realize that relying solely on individual decision-making, even for the wisest monarch, can lead to errors. Therefore, we should establish the Royal Cabinet system, employing advisors to assess national policies, thereby better waging our holy war."

EDG_AEL_mission_4_19_title:0 "Silver Absolutism" # The Silver Absolutist System
EDG_AEL_mission_4_19_desc:0 "Due to the weak control of the French King over the southern French lords in the pre-French era, and the chaotic fragmentation of Southern France following the Albigensian Crusade, the Kingdom of Arles experienced severe turmoil before and for a period after its establishment. As monarchical power continuously strengthened and central authority expanded, we established an effective absolutist system, which some statesmen have named the 'Silver Absolutist System.'"

EDG_AEL_mission_5_2_title:0 "The Holy Land of Aix"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_2_desc:0 "After over two hundred years of development, by the immense grace of the Supreme God, Aix has gradually prospered. Day and night, countless True Believers, from Ireland to Cathay, come to Aix to embrace the true theology. Without a doubt, we can proudly declare that Aix is now in no way inferior to the stronghold of the false god's followers—Rome."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_3_title:0 "Aix Cathedral"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_3_desc:0 "As the unquestionable religious center of the nation, the churches of Aix are ceaselessly flooded with a continuous stream of the faithful day and night. As time progresses, the churches of Aix grow ever more prosperous. New columns, beams, statues, and shrines are constructed piece by piece. Aix Cathedral has undoubtedly grown into the largest church in our realm."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_4_title:0 "Win Over the Rector"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_4_desc:0 "Shortly after the conclusion of the false crusade, Piedmont converted to the True Faith and established a deep friendship with our nation. We should strengthen our relations with Piedmont by inviting their local clergy to our country to collaborate hand in hand for further missionary work."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_5_title:0 "Tame the Nobility" # Tame the Religious Nobility
EDG_AEL_mission_5_5_desc:0 "Although we have gradually undertaken purification and cleansing within the Church, there are still a significant number of religious nobles within the country. We can no longer allow their actions to go unchecked; they must be placed entirely under the control of the Church."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_7_title:0 "Strengthen Church Control"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_7_desc:0 "Before our great army reaches Rome, we must ensure that everything is absolutely secure. To this end, we must increase the clergy's loyalty to our nation. Only after ensuring a firm grip on the Church can we proceed with our next steps."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_10_title:0 "The Secular and Religious" # Leaders of the Secular and Religious Worlds
EDG_AEL_mission_5_10_desc:0 "We are already the leaders of the Cathar world and the secular Cathar Holy Roman Emperor. It is an inevitable requirement to permanently hold the positions of both religious leader and secular lord in our hands."
 
EDG_AEL_mission_5_12_title:0 "Montpellier Textile Industry"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_12_desc:0 "Ever since our kingdom was established over a century ago, our kings have planned to extensively develop the textile industry in Montpellier. Today, weavers from almost the entire nation labor in Montpellier, with bolts of cloth being transported to distant lands."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_13_title:0 "Milan Textile Workshop"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_13_desc:0 "As our rule in Northern Italy grows increasingly stable, it is necessary for us to consolidate the textile industry there. Milan is an excellent choice: it is economically prosperous with a developed textile sector, making it an ideal location to establish a large textile manufactory."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_14_title:0 "The Nation Upon the Loom"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_14_desc:0 "Now, if a noblewoman possesses a garment made of Arlesian cloth, she will be the most radiant one at the banquet. Arlesian textiles have become a household name. The textile industry of our nation has gained recognition from all countries. We are the undisputed kingdom of the textile industry."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_16_title:0 "The Shadow Under the Crown" # The Shadow Beneath the Crown
EDG_AEL_mission_5_16_desc:0 "Although our state has been established for nearly two centuries, effective centralization has yet to be achieved. We should gradually reclaim the territories held by various estates to consolidate royal authority and enhance our control over the regions."

EDG_AEL_mission_5_18_title:0 "Establish the Secretariat"
EDG_AEL_mission_5_18_desc:0 "As the number of our advisors and secretaries gradually increases, we should establish a unified department to manage them. A Secretariat would effectively help us oversee the secretaries and better consolidate the advisors' recommendations for the King's reference."
