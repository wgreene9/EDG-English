Dry red wines made from Pinot Noir possess an elusive character, yet they share some common traits and characteristics across different regions. The most representative are the premium Pinot Noir wines from Burgundy, France, renowned for their complexity, multi-layered profiles, refined smoothness, and aging potential. Layers of aromas gradually unfold, revealing elegant notes of violet and rose, alongside fruity scents of strawberry and cherry, complemented by captivating hints of baking, oak, tobacco, and even autumnal leaves. The wines are not deeply colored and are suitable for extended aging. As they mature, they evolve, developing spicy, animal, and leather aromas. 'Aromatic yet not showy, rich yet not cloying, with a silky-smooth texture' best describes the finest Pinot Noir wines, making those from Burgundy among the world's most luxurious and expensive wines.

Unlike ordinary crowns, each grape variety officially recognized by the royal family is represented by a gemstone selected to match the hue of its grapes. These gems are meticulously cut and polished into transparent forms and set into the crown. This unparalleled crown represents the pinnacle of craftsmanship and symbolizes absolute authority over grape and wine culture. Every vineyard within our realm and beyond aspires to have their newly cultivated grape varieties featured on this crown, as it signifies not only recognition of the grape variety but also the prestige that accompanies such an honor."
BUR_3:0 "New Grapes!"
BUR_3_desc:0 "Typically, vineyards across the land independently develop new grape varieties and wine-making techniques. However, the drawbacks of this approach are evident. We must directly intervene in the royal vineyards under our governance, encouraging crossbreeding and cultivation of various grape varieties, and fostering exchanges of expertise among winemakers from different regions. This will enable us to discover more grape varieties and refine wine-making techniques more swiftly and effectively!"
BUR_4:0 "Knights of the Grape"
BUR_4_desc:0 "To revive the fading culture of chivalry and enhance the kingdom's military strength, each grape variety officially recognized by the royal family is permitted to establish a knightly order named after that variety. These orders are to be developed in the grape's region of origin. Unlike traditional knights, these orders pledge direct allegiance to the owner of the Prismatic Crown. Moreover, their chivalric code includes viticulture and winemaking as essential skills. Thus, in addition to fulfilling military duties, these knights participate in vineyard management, and the orders may recruit members from local vineyards."
BUR_5:0 "Wine Festival Culture"
BUR_5_desc:0 "A celebration without wine is as dull as a celebration without wine! A celebration without wine is no celebration at all! To select superior grape varieties and wines, a grand feast and festival are held every few years. Attendees include not only the upper nobility but also a large number of middle and lower classes. The nobility will taste and choose the most outstanding grape varieties, while a diverse selection of wines from various regions is made available for sampling. Furthermore, such events have inspired spontaneous celebratory customs in cities and villages across the land. Although their scale pales in comparison to royally organized events, they remain the vital pillar sustaining and spreading wine festival culture among the common people."
BUR_6:0 "Royal Saltworks"
BUR_6_desc:0 "Beyond grapes, the production of salt—this 'white gold'—is one of our most important trade commodities. The saltworks at Salins-les-Bains in Franche-Comté have a history spanning centuries. However, as the drawbacks of traditional solar evaporation methods become increasingly apparent, the royal court has decided to regulate production in the region. By renovating the existing saltworks, we will design a semi-circular, early-modern industrial saltworks and adopt boiling methods to expand and standardize salt production."
BUR_7:0 "Irrigation Upgrades"
BUR_7_desc:0 "With advances in technology, grape cultivation methods are also evolving, aiming to increase efficiency while enhancing grape quality. Typically, this is a concern for individual vineyards. However, as they rely heavily on traditional experience, scientific progress must not be constrained by existing practices. Establishing a dedicated academy to study these issues will help vineyards across the land solve problems and consolidate existing knowledge, thereby significantly improving the viticultural standards of all vineyards."

According to related records, the drama of Loire Valley wine history began at the dawn of the Middle Ages (5th century AD), with the first recorded mention of vineyards in the Touraine region around 582 AD. Many of the wines from its sub-regions gained great fame starting in the Middle Ages, with royalty and religious figures playing an indispensable role. Count Henry II of Anjou is one such royal figure who cannot be overlooked. He became King of England in 1154, and under his patronage, Anjou wines were grandly introduced to the court, earning the deep affection of various royal family members.

EDG_Chateau_Rhone:0 "Rhône Valley Wine Estate"
EDG_Chateau_Rhone_desc:0 "The Rhône Valley wine region is distributed in a long, narrow strip along the Rhône River valley, stretching about 200 kilometers from north to south. Due to differences in climate and soil conditions, it can be divided into two major areas: the Northern Rhône and the Southern Rhône. The Northern Rhône region has a continental climate, where dry and cold northern winds accelerate grape ripening. Its vineyards are mostly located on steep riverbank slopes, shaped like terraces. In the Southern Rhône region, the climate is Mediterranean, with abundant sunshine, ample rainfall, and also dry, cold strong winds. When the Romans invaded France in the 1st century BC, they brought winemaking techniques. Discovering the Rhône Valley as an excellent place for growing grapes, they cultivated it into vineyards, thus beginning the history of French wine. Later, during the papal disputes, the Pope came to Avignon in the Rhône Valley to take refuge. To meet the Pope's demand for wine, local winemaking techniques made a significant leap forward."
EDG_Chateau_Champagne:0 "Champagne Wine Estate"
EDG_Chateau_Champagne_desc:0 "The Champagne region is located east of Paris, France, around the city of Reims, including parts of the Marne, Aisne, and Aube departments. Champagne is the birthplace of Champagne wine. According to French law, only sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region can be called 'Champagne,' while similar wines from other regions are referred to as 'sparkling wine.' Vineyards have existed in the Champagne region since the beginning of the Common Era. Although the vineyard area has continuously shrunk, its characteristics were recognized early, and it was among the first to receive protection under the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC). Compared to Bordeaux's 2,000 hours and Burgundy's 1,900 hours of annual sunshine, Champagne has a very short sunshine duration: only 1,650 hours per year. The temperature here is low, with an annual average of just 10.5°C, and winters are very cold. Grapevines require an environment of at least 9°C to ripen grapes. With such a low average temperature, it is common to encounter winters where no harvest is possible. However, Champagne still possesses two favorable conditions: moderate and regular rainfall, and excellent soil—primarily composed of chalky substances left by the retreat of the sea 70 million years ago. Chalk soil is valuable for regulating soil moisture content. During dry seasons, it retains water, while in seasons of ample rainfall, it absorbs large amounts of water. Thus, the roots of grapevines can absorb moisture from the ground year-round."

EDG_Chateau_Mosel_desc:0 "The Mosel is one of Germany's northernmost wine regions, located at 50°N latitude with a cool climate, making it particularly suitable for growing Pinot Noir. The cool climate requires a longer growing and ripening period for the grapes here, allowing them to develop complex and intense aromas. Most vineyards in the river valley face south, enabling the vines to absorb more sunlight and aiding grape ripening. Rainfall here is low, and the steep slopes of the vineyards provide excellent drainage. The soil has low moisture content, contributing to the production of concentrated wines. The river also moderates the climate, preventing excessively cold winters and overly hot summers. However, most vineyards are located on steep slopes, which increases the cost of viticulture."

Rheinhessen wines are known for their soft, gentle, and distinctive character, making them easily recognizable compared to other German wines. Due to the mild climate, the grapes here do not have to struggle against harsh conditions, which can sometimes result in less distinctiveness. Nevertheless, these wines are beloved for their rich aromas and crisp, refreshing flavors. Most are made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, which produce wines that are soft, juicy, and fruity. Another widely used grape variety is Silvaner, which yields full-bodied and robust wines."

Viticulture in the Baden region has a very long history. After the Ice Age, wild grapevines began to grow in this area. In the 2nd century AD, grape cultivation spread northward from Lake Constance and reached its peak in the 16th century. The wines of that time were described as 'bright in color, robust in taste, and highly beneficial to health...' Annual per capita consumption was about 140 liters, and the wines were transported downstream via the Rhine River. Today, Germany's annual per capita wine consumption is 32 bottles, while in the Baden region, it is 53 bottles—the highest per capita consumption in all of Germany—demonstrating the people's enthusiasm for wine in this area."

EDG_St_Cyprian_Cathedral_desc:0 "St. Cyprian's Cathedral was constructed in 1305, three years after the founding of the Tunisian Order of St. Cyprian. Funds were raised through donations organized by local bishops across European countries, with the hope of building a grand cathedral to commemorate the patron saint, St. Cyprian, and the success of the Children's Crusade of 1221. Due to maritime route challenges, the construction process was slow. Fortunately, Tunisia's abundant local marble resources allowed for largely local sourcing of materials. The initial construction phase was planned for completion before 1400. However, the rise of the Sahada Dynasty in 1380 placed immense pressure on the Crusaders, causing repeated delays in the building plans. The dome was finally completed in 1437.\n\nThe cathedral's architectural style is primarily Gothic, popular at the time, but also incorporates Tunisian local elements. Its main framework is built from marble, with an exterior painted pure white. The interior hall is 24 meters wide and 67 meters long, with the central vault reaching a maximum height of 20 meters. Only two spires stand at the entrance, with the tallest spire reaching 57 meters. The cathedral's interior is entirely constructed of white marble. Compared to other churches of the same period, its interior decoration is notably sparse, mainly displaying relics from the Children's Crusade era for pilgrims to venerate. The side windows do not use traditional Gothic stained glass but rather simple single-pane glass to reduce construction costs.\n\nThe cathedral is still undergoing further expansion. Although St. Cyprian's Cathedral may appear relatively plain, rough, and unsophisticated compared to many small and medium-sized European churches, its fusion of Gothic and North African architectural styles gives it distinctive merits among churches. Furthermore, it remains, to this day, the largest Catholic cathedral in North Africa, providing spiritual inspiration to the young people who eagerly travel from various regions to Tunisia to join the Crusades."

EDG_Church_of_Crusade:0 "Church of the Crusade"
EDG_Church_of_Crusade_desc:0 "After Count Raymond II of Toulouse defeated the First Albigensian Crusade and achieved victory, Catharism spread like wildfire throughout Occitania. Considering strategic interests in Italy and to strengthen control over Provence, Count Raymond II ordered the construction of a new church in Forcalquier. Named after the crusade, it was intended to commemorate the crushing of the First Albigensian Crusade.\n\nAlthough Cathar doctrine advocated destroying churches rather than building them, there were ways to persuade the populace. One method was quite unusual: the church was initially designed not for preaching or commemoration but as a fortification. It followed the concept of 'inner courtyard, outer fortress,' meaning the interior housed a small monastery and church, while the exterior featured castle-like defensive structures, both serving their functions simultaneously. Therefore, the military significance of the Church of the Crusade as a fortress far outweighed its commemorative role as a church. Construction officially began in 1210.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of the Second Albigensian Crusade interrupted the church's construction. At the start of the war, only the main chapel of the Church of the Crusade was completed, while the outer walls had not even been started. The arriving French army thoroughly looted the church without any hindrance. It was not until 1260, after being crowned King of Arles, that Raymond I immediately began repairing, constructing, and expanding the Church of the Crusade, attempting to create the next Carcassonne Castle on the Alpine border.\n\nThe church was completed in 1443. The final scale of the Church of the Crusade was nearly twice its original size: the interior main church was completely rebuilt, equipped with several monasteries and various auxiliary facilities, achieving self-sufficiency through nearby villages. Additionally, leveraging the Lure Mountain, the outer walls were reconstructed, and the fortifications were repeatedly expanded outward. Although in terms of overall scale, design compromises due to geographical factors, and other aspects, its military function still fell short of Carcassonne Castle, its role in preaching and dissemination was by no means insignificant.\n\nThe victories in the two Albigensian Crusades allowed Catharism to spread widely into the Piedmont region of southern Italy. The Church of the Crusade, serving as a bridge connecting Occitania and Piedmont, became one of the most important strongholds in the Cathar world, whether for missionary activities or military operations. As the Piedmont region fully aligned with Catharism, although the Church of the Crusade was no longer the bridgehead into Italy, it remained a crucial hub active in various missionary endeavors."

EDG_Mainz_StMartins_Cathedral_desc:0 "Since its construction began in 975 AD, Mainz Cathedral has consistently been built according to plan. Although it has undergone multiple stylistic changes, new sections were primarily added, with minimal alterations to the original structure. The cathedral is the seat of the Catholic Diocese of Mainz and is dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It holds significant historical and artistic importance as a masterpiece born of Christian faith in Europe. The fortunes of the powerful successive Archbishops of Mainz have fluctuated over time, and the cathedral's fate has similarly been eventful."

EDG_Frankfurt_Cathedral:0 "Imperial Dome of Saint Bartholomew" # Frankfurt Cathedral (Imperial Cathedral)
EDG_Frankfurt_Cathedral_desc:0 "Frankfurt Cathedral, located east of the Römerberg (Roman Square), is a Gothic-style building. Constructed between the 13th and 15th centuries in the Gothic style, it is also known as the Imperial Cathedral (Kaiserdom) and the Coronation Church. The cathedral treasury displays the magnificent robes worn by archbishops during coronation ceremonies. A staircase of 332 steps leads to the top of the tower, which offers a panoramic view of the entire city. The main tower is a splendid 15th-century Gothic spire, standing 95 meters tall. The election hall on the cathedral's south side was once the place where emperors were elected. Interestingly, the cathedral has never had an archbishop."

EDG_Speyer_Cathedral:0 "Speyer Cathedral"
EDG_Speyer_Cathedral_desc:0 "Speyer Cathedral was initially constructed in 1030, during the reign of Conrad II. It was later renovated towards the end of the 11th century. The main components of the cathedral are the great hall, four corner towers, and two vaulted ceilings. It is one of the most renowned Romanesque buildings from the Holy Roman Empire era, with its architectural style clearly influenced by both Eastern and Western architectural cultures. Speyer Cathedral is the largest Romanesque-style church in Europe and one of the principal monuments from the Holy Roman Empire period.\n\nWhen first built, Speyer Cathedral served as the private church and burial site for the Salian dynasty (a Frankish tribe inhabiting the Netherlands in the 4th century) nobility. It was considered one of the most magnificent religious buildings in the Western world. Beneath the church lies a crypt, completed around 1030, few of its kind and structure in the world can rival it. Today, the crypt is an excellent tourist attraction, housing the tombs of numerous medieval kings and queens (at least eight), including Emperor Conrad II. These burials took place between 1039 and 1309. Conrad II was initially buried elsewhere for the first two years after his death, as the crypt had not yet been fully completed at the time.\n\nThe stone color of the cathedral is remarkably eye-catching: a mix of goose-yellow and various shades of red interwoven together. Combined with the cathedral's grand architectural form, it stands as a marvel in the history of world architecture."

EDG_Royal_Palace_of_Amsterdam_desc:0 "The Royal Palace of Amsterdam is situated on Dam Square in the heart of Amsterdam. Completed in 1648 and designed by Jacob van Campen, the building was originally intended to serve as Amsterdam's city hall.\n\nThe palace rests on a foundation supported by 13,659 wooden pilings. One of these pilings was once extracted and tested for its load-bearing capacity, confirming that the entire structure faces no risk of subsidence. These foundation pilings, driven into the ground between 1648 and 1655, are considered one of the eight wonders of architectural history. Initially functioning as the city hall and court of law, the palace was once the political and economic center of the city and the entire Dutch Republic. Its location—the Dam—was also the city's most important square and a favored subject for painters. Today, it remains vibrant and full of life."

EDG_Leipzig_University:0 "University of Leipzig"
EDG_Leipzig_University_desc:0 "In Europe, apart from the already existing universities, most newly founded universities in the 13th century were initiated and established by the Pope. Entering the 14th century, monarchs across Europe began establishing their own universities, though they still required papal approval, leading to a rapid increase in the number of European universities. The Western Schism of 1378-1417 had a profound impact on Europe's political landscape and the distribution of universities. Due to the schism, teachers and students from various parts of Europe who had previously gathered in Paris distinctly sided with the pope supported by their respective regions. Sharp ethnic divisions and conflicts over religious beliefs caused a large-scale exodus of German teachers and students from the University of Paris back to their homeland, which in turn spurred the emergence of numerous universities within Germany. With strong papal support in German-speaking regions, a movement to establish new universities arose in the latter half of the 14th century, with these new institutions receiving papal charters.\n\nIn 1409, a similar split occurred at Charles University in Prague, causing many teachers and students in Prague to return to Germany. Against this backdrop, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen from the House of Wettin, later Elector Frederick I of Saxony, and his brother, Margrave William II of Meissen, founded the University of Leipzig in 1409. The university's Faculty of Arts accommodated the returning teachers and students from Prague. The University of Leipzig received substantial funding from local rulers, gained recognition from Pope Alexander V on September 9 of the same year, and was formally established on December 2. Subsequently, the Faculty of Medicine (1415) and the Faculty of Law (1446) were established."
