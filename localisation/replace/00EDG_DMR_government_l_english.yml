EDG_DMR_domria_government_1:0 "Land of the Gypsies"
EDG_DMR_domria_government_1_desc:0 "We have wandered across the world, facing discrimination everywhere. Elegant literati speak of our free-spirited lives, but does such freedom not also require the sustenance of daily necessities? Yet never before has any nation, any government, been able to offer us that support, to become our backbone. But now it is different. Our great Roma, or Gypsies, have finally united under a single banner."

EDG_DMR_gone_2:0 "Laissez-Faire Governance"
EDG_DMR_gone_2_desc:0 "The nation we have built is one where the ruling ethnic group is vastly outnumbered by the ruled populations. Therefore, we absolutely must not resort to violent means of suppression or forceful promotion of our policies. Governing according to local customs is perhaps the best choice."

EDG_DMR_ground_poetry_3:0 "Poetry of the Earth"
EDG_DMR_ground_poetry_3_desc:0 "Though we have no formal education, our poetry surpasses that of any scholar. Though our people have no written script, our literature rivals that of any nation. Beneath the beauty and grandeur of art, all beings equally bathe in the ocean of poetry."

EDG_DMR_tank_4:0 "Great Wagon Chariots"
EDG_DMR_tank_4_desc:0 "The wagons we use for daily migration are sturdy and stable, with vast interior space and well-arranged compartments. Thus, we can refit them into war chariots, providing formidable mobility and cover for launching overwhelming firepower assaults."

EDG_DMR_religion_6:0 "Gospel of All Wisdom"
EDG_DMR_religion_6_desc:0 "Ages have passed since the Prophet's birth, and the countless Gospels he spread for the Lord have long been distorted by various powers. Yet, fortunately, the great Bogomil priest has returned the Lord's truth to the world. As one of his followers today, it is our duty to take up the torch of its propagation. Let those shameful, oath-breaking heretics suffer the punishment of eating stone!"

EDG_DMR_parliament_7:0 "Two-Wheel Parliament"
EDG_DMR_parliament_7_desc:0 "'I steer the wheel of history, gazing back at the ruts left behind.'"
