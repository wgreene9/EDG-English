EDG_HAB_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Legend traces the lineage of the House of Habsburg back to the mysterious Etichonid family, Counts of Alsace, and further to the Frankish Merovingian kings, with their mythical ancestor being a five-horned bull from the 5th century. Historical records first mention Habsburg activities in the late 10th century in the Upper Rhine and Alsace regions—today's Franco-German border and the Swiss canton of Aargau. This territory lay within the Duchy of Swabia and the Holy Roman Empire, divided into autonomous counties granted to various counts. The first historically documented member of the Habsburgs was a minor count named Kanzelin (also known as Lanzelin), whose lands centered around a small fortress at Altenburg near the town of Brugg in Aargau. Initially, the Habsburgs were just one among many feudal lordly families in Swiss Aargau. Through gradual expansion, we eventually rose to become one of the Empire's great princes, no longer content with being merely a count within the Empire."

EDG_HAB_mission_1_2_title:0 "The Swabian Federation"
EDG_HAB_mission_1_2_desc:0 "In the beginning, the Habsburgs were merely one ordinary feudal family among many in the Swiss canton of Aargau. Historians attribute their rise to political maneuvering. At the start of the 12th century, they supported Emperor Lothair III (1125-1137) against the Hohenstaufen, receiving in return extensive lands in Upper Alsace and the prestigious title of count. By the mid-12th century, the Habsburgs shifted allegiance to the Hohenstaufen. In 1167, Werner II, loyal to Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I "Barbarossa" and grandson of Count Werner the Elder, died in battle near Rome. His son Albert "the Rich" and grandson Rudolf "the Old" (also known as Rudolf "the Good," died 1232) served Philip of Swabia and Frederick of Hohenstaufen respectively. Rudolf even funded Frederick's campaigns, helping him ascend to the imperial throne in 1211 as Emperor Frederick II. In return, Rudolf was granted marriage ties to the Hohenstaufen and vast territories in the southwest of the Holy Roman Empire, with Frederick II becoming godfather to Rudolf's grandson. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, they busily intermarried with feudal families in present-day Switzerland and southwestern Germany. Whenever royal in-laws died out, the Habsburgs legitimately claimed these "inherited gifts." Through such means, they acquired all or parts of the lands of the Lenzburg, Pfirt, and Kyburg families, achieving unprecedented territorial expansion in the southwest of the Empire and gradually becoming a major nobility in Swabia. The task of rebuilding the Duchy of Swabia thus fell upon the Habsburg dynasty."

EDG_HAB_mission_1_5_desc:0 "Sigismund was Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Luxembourg. Born in Nuremberg, he was the son of Charles IV. He was Elector of Brandenburg, elected King of the Romans in 1411, and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1433. He was also King of Hungary and Croatia, and King of Bohemia. Considered highly educated, he spoke multiple languages including Hungarian, German, Latin, French, and Italian, and was fond of knightly tournaments including jousting. He worked to end the Western Schism, convening the Council of Constance in Germany from 1414 to 1418, which elected Pope Martin V and resolved the schism. However, during the council, the execution of Czech theologian Jan Hus sparked the prolonged Hussite Wars in Bohemia, which troubled Sigismund in his later years. Now, the great Emperor Sigismund has died without heirs. According to his arrangements, the throne was to pass to his son-in-law, Albert II of Habsburg, but Albert died in war against the Turks. The successor now appears to be his posthumous child, though the latter is clearly unable to fully inherit Sigismund's empire... Indeed, no one can."

In 1513, following in his father Peter's footsteps, he began serving Maximilian. His son, Hans Christoph, later became a leading European gun-founder. Löffler was the first master gunsmith to produce weapons on an industrial scale and cast many monumental statues for Maximilian. Beyond the central arsenal in Innsbruck, Maximilian established a series of arsenals to protect his borders: in Sigmundskron and Trent against the Italians; in Lindau against the Swiss; in Breisach against the French; in Vienna against the Hungarians; and in Graz, Hochosterwitz, Laibach (Ljubljana), and Görz against the Turks and Venetians. The Löffler craft holds an important place in military history. It significantly improved the reliability of cannons and allowed them to adapt to more battlefield conditions. By widely applying this new artillery manufacturing technique, we can produce high-quality artillery units, facilitating our expansion."

According to contemporary records, Maximilian could deploy 105 cannons of various sizes, made of both iron and bronze. The Innsbruck Arsenal he created was one of Europe's most famous artillery factories, and the cannons it produced were once considered the finest in all of Western Europe. With the progress of our nation's productivity and the gradual spread of large-scale factory production, we have widely established various arsenals across the Empire to supply the latest military equipment to the front lines.

Less well-known is that he also implemented financial reforms within the Habsburg monarchy. He centralized fiscal authority, consolidating the empire's financial management. Under his influence, the Habsburgs' financial situation improved significantly. Maximilian's choice of Innsbruck as the treasury's location spoke volumes. Backed by Tyrol's rich gold and silver deposits, the central treasury could use future minting revenues as collateral to obtain cash from the bankers of Augsburg, like the Fuggers and the Welsers. These high-interest loans temporarily alleviated Maximilian's fiscal pressures. Given Innsbruck's significant political influence at the time, Maximilian ordered the expansion of a palace there. On one hand, he erected a "Helblinghaus" adorned with various coats of arms representing the empire's orderly and hierarchical territories. On the other, he oversaw the construction of a loggia overlooking Innsbruck's main square, where he could comfortably watch sports tournaments and equestrian displays.

The following year, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz presented her with a political reform plan, mainly consisting of: a ten-year plan to weaken the power of the estate nobility; the establishment of a supreme court; and the separation of judiciary and administration.

Empress Theresa astutely recognized this and gradually weakened the Diet's privileges, thereby greatly strengthening royal centralization. War consumed nearly half of Maria Theresa's reign. Fiscal reforms, marked by measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, laid a solid foundation for her successful military campaigns. Upon the advice of the shrewd Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, she increased taxes and bound the Diets with ten-year agreements, saving considerable time wasted on annual negotiations. Furthermore, she abolished many fiscal privileges previously held by the Diets. When the estate powers complained, the Empress responded firmly. To the chattering Carniolan Diet on the issue of taxes, she decreed, "The Crown expressly demands the immediate approval of the following sums." Similarly, in 1775, when promulgating a constitution for her annexed Polish-Lithuanian territories—now grandly named the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria—she stripped the Diet of all authority over taxation.

On the other, he oversaw the construction of a loggia overlooking Innsbruck's main square, where he could comfortably watch sports tournaments and equestrian displays. Today, the loggia's famous "Golden Roof," with its opulent gilded copper tiles, still proudly overlooks Innsbruck's main square, a testament to history."

EDG_HAB_mission_4_26_desc:0 "During his reign, Ferdinand I established the Imperial Privy Council to effectively manage the Habsburg monarchy's numerous fiefdoms scattered across Europe. The administration through the Privy Council significantly enhanced control over the various fiefdoms, further strengthening the power of the Habsburg dynasty. Due to his frequent absences, Ferdinand delegated the governance of Hungary and Bohemia to regency councils. The main duties of these councils included hearing appeals from lower courts and handling various petitions. Consequently, the Privy Council became the sole department responsible for coordinating overall governmental operations. Founded in 1527, the Privy Council consisted of no more than twelve advisors who accompanied Ferdinand on his travels and inspections."

EDG_HAB_mission_4_30_desc:0 "If a nation's constitutional governance is guaranteed and the duties of its ministers are clearly defined, then tracing the origins of public affairs is not difficult. Conversely, if a nation's policies are unfair and ministers can only offer advice in secret, then, on the surface, all decisions appear to be made by the monarch alone, making it impossible for people to discern whether the advisor's actions or the monarch's actions are predominant. With the high prosperity of our nation's economy, politics, and culture, along with the gradual centralization of authority, Habsburg-style enlightened absolutism has been established. All the people bask in the glory of the Emperor, the Habsburg economy flourishes, and the nation's strength steadily increases."

EDG_HAB_mission_5_1_desc:0 "In 1411, Duke Albert (1397-1439) rose to power and took over the Duchy of Austria. The Habsburg family, struggling in the darkness, finally received the favor of Fortuna. Albert was a devout and active church reformer, a capable ruler, and a valiant warrior, widely regarded as a mentor and friend. However, beneath his amiable exterior lay a cruel, illiterate, and despotic tyrant. In 1420, he brazenly abolished the Habsburg tradition of protecting Austrian Jews, subjecting them to brutal persecution so severe it drew the disapproval of the new Pope. Albert was solely intent on plundering the Jews' savings to fund King Sigismund's campaign against the Hussite heresy in Bohemia. After gaining control of Moravia, Albert's persecution of the Jews intensified. His political actions fostered resentment towards the Habsburg dynasty among Jews both at home and abroad, posing significant challenges to many of the dynasty's commercial activities and territorial governance. Re-examining our policies towards the Jews is an essential step for the dynasty's rise."

EDG_HAB_mission_5_2_desc:0 "Charles the Fat briefly reunified all the territories once ruled by Charlemagne and was crowned Emperor by Pope John VIII in 881. However, his rule was very weak, and the empire's unity was largely superficial. In 887, Charles the Fat was deposed and replaced by his nephew, Arnulf, Duke of Carinthia. Charles the Fat's downfall marked the end of the history of a unified Frankish state. Although the empire fragmented, the various splintered Carolingian dynasties eventually died out, yet Lotharingia persists on the continent of Western Europe. However, Lotharingia's political structure has always been very loose. It appears vast, but internally harbors many feudal lords disloyal to the royal court. The Germans among them are eager to break away from the Kingdom of Lotharingia, which has consistently sought to weaken their power, and instead turn to the Empire with its higher degree of decentralization. Numerous other contradictions have also plunged the kingdom into the dilemma of fragmentation multiple times throughout history. Lotharingia is already a centipede that refuses to die, but the ancient rule of the Carolingian dynasty will be ended by us."

With Southern France occupied by the Cathars, who refuse to recognize the French King's authority, the Capetian dynasty is already precarious, waiting only for the Habsburgs' iron fist to completely eliminate French power."

EDG_HAB_mission_5_11_title:0 "Chronicle of the 95 Lords" # Chronicle of the Ninety-Five Lords
EDG_HAB_mission_5_11_desc:0 "Genealogical romances were a special literary genre popular in late medieval Europe. Their creators attempted to weave familiar mythical figures like mermaids, Amazon warriors, giants, and dragons into the lineages of contemporary nobility and royalty. The ‘Chronicle of the Ninety-Five Lords,’ which incorporates biblical stories, imperial history, Austrian lore, and even fanciful heraldry and imaginative biographies, stands as a masterpiece of this genre. The fifty surviving manuscripts from the 15th century attest to its enduring literary appeal, and its content was passed down through generations with increasingly embellished details by later authors. Some authors added legends like that of Norix, a son of Hercules who founded Austria, and claimed that Caesar built the city of Vienna (where he supposedly stayed for a biennium, hence the name). They even included forged letters from Caesar and Nero. Others ambitiously compiled a ‘World Chronicle’ merging the four traditional empires (Assyrian, Persian, Greek-Macedonian, and Roman) with the brilliant achievements of Habsburg rulers. With our control over Austria, our economic and political center has gradually shifted from Württemberg to Austria. To strengthen the legitimacy of our rule, we should compile a ‘history’ for our territories. Although this ‘history’ may be more fiction than fact, it will suffice to glorify the magnificent achievements of our dynasty."

EDG_HAB_mission_5_12_desc:0 "With the Emperor's control over the Imperial domains, our grip on the Empire is steadily strengthening. Imperial patronage of culture has ignited a new cultural flourishing, and Vienna has truly become a city of scholars and art. Through personal sponsorship, the Emperor has sparked a new wave of cultural fervor within the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian's reign radiated strong personal charisma and an undeniable presence. Where he could not physically be, portraits served to embody the subjects' imagination of their Emperor. Thousands of surviving portraits have made the resolute visage of Maximilian a familiar image of a ruler across Europe. Artists summoned to the court used exaggerated strokes to depict his likeness and achievements. Led by Albrecht Dürer and Albrecht Altdorfer, engravers created two grand series of woodcuts for Maximilian, named The Triumphal Procession and The Triumphal Arch, to extol his noble lineage and glorious deeds. These prints, produced on continuous rolls of wallpaper, were dispatched to hundreds of territories and cities, adorning the palaces and council halls of feudal lords. Maximilian also kept a host of court poets and writers to compose verses in his praise. He crowned the Renaissance scholar Conrad Celtis as poet laureate and appointed him dean of the Faculty of Poetry and Mathematics at the University of Vienna. Celtis returned the favor by lauding Maximilian as a great hunter and warrior, comparing him to ancient heroes of German history. Besides Celtis, Maximilian bestowed the laurel upon nearly forty poets, creating a rush of people eager to sing praises of his rule."

EDG_HAB_mission_5_13_title:0 "A.E.I.O.U"
EDG_HAB_mission_5_13_desc:0 "The enigmatic five-letter motto 'AEIOU,' the heraldic relief on the western wall of St. George's Church, and the burgeoning chronicle literature of the Middle Ages all point to the same theme: Austria is more than a mere geographical concept. This land and its inherent rulers are destined to be creators of extraordinary achievements and witnesses to great history. Indeed, Austria is not just a territory; it is a comprehensive community of shared destiny, embodying empire, mission, tradition, and fate. While the names of a dynasty's primary domains often determine the titles of its main rulers—such as the House of Brandenburg or the House of Saxony—Austria is an exception. Beyond its geography, it carries the enduring faith and unceasing hope of an ancient family. For later Habsburg princes who traveled to Burgundy or Spain to claim their thrones, their identity remained that of the House of Austria, even when separated from their distant homeland by vast expanses. The meaning of Austria for the Habsburgs exists not only in the physical present but is also rooted in the memories of the past. Now that we have finally become the Holy Roman Emperor and stabilized the realm, we can proudly declare ourselves the world's sole, divinely blessed, unique Emperor of the Roman Empire, the sole legitimate heir to Rome's glory. The Habsburg dynasty shall inherit and magnify the splendor of Rome."
