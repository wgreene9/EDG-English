EDG_HER_mission.1.t:0 "The Nightingale in a Gilded Cage"
EDG_HER_mission.1.d:0 "Whether it be that incompetent king, his ambitious brother, or the rumored precocious Princess Margaret, the House of Plantagenet has no chance of resurgence under our combined efforts. Driven out like stray dogs, they have lost the possibility of contending for supremacy in Britain. The fate of this land is now ours to decide."
EDG_HER_mission.1.a:0 "Grant the House of Plantagenet a final measure of dignity"
EDG_HER_mission.1.b:0 "Britain has no welcome for you, spawn of the French!"

EDG_HER_mission_1_TT:0 "Adds 1 development to all Mercian culture provinces"
EDG_HER_mission.2.t:0 "Dance with the Dragon"
EDG_HER_mission.2.d:0 "We fought for so long on either side of Offa's Dyke, yet the Vikings and Normans turned our strife into a mockery. Now we are allies who can trust one another, and the long dyke built by King Offa should not be a barrier to friendship.\n\nThe White Dragon of the East and the Red Dragon of the West need not vie for supremacy any longer; both slumbering in stone coffins should not be our fate."
EDG_HER_mission.2.a:0 "We have had enough of strife; it is time to stop."
EDG_HER_mission.3.t:0 "A New Order"
EDG_HER_mission.3.d:0 "After taking over the vast influence of the Plantagenet family, our scale has expanded to that of Mercia's golden age under King Offa's rule. Our close allies are also willing to continue cooperating with us to confront the Celts in the north. The old city-state order is no longer suitable for us; we need a new order to safeguard the fruits of our victory in Britain."
EDG_HER_mission.3.a:0 "We are united by a common goal and move forward through mutual trust."
EDG_HER_mission_3_A_TT:0 "Unlocks Decision: Listen to the Lollards' Demands (This decision appears when there are Lollard provinces within the realm)"
EDG_HER_mission_3_B_TT:0 "Adds the §TFriendly§! option to the Celtic Act event"

EDG_HER_mission.4.t:0 "The Borough League's Endeavor"
EDG_HER_mission.4.d:0 "Since the signing of the 'Magna Carta,' the Mercians of the East Midlands have de facto separated from England's feudal system, becoming fervent imitators of the Holy Roman Empire's Free Cities. Once united in heart, the Mercians have become embroiled in endless strife through commercial competition with one another, so much so that they have been slow to realize it—the era of war is returning amidst the struggle for supremacy among the kings of Britain.\n\nBut the small East Midlands is mere prey in the eyes of Britain's kings. For self-preservation, we must set aside past grievances and face this challenge together as Mercians."
EDG_HER_mission.4.a:0 "Every great story has an insignificant beginning."

EDG_HER_mission.5.t:0 "Integrating the Borough League"
EDG_HER_mission.5.d:0 "The results of integration are remarkable. We have unified our internal market, largely achieving the free flow of goods, personnel, and services. Our city guards cooperate closely, and Mercians are no longer prey for Britain's kings. We must defend our unity and integration."
EDG_HER_mission.5.a:0 "It is time to advance further."

EDG_HER_mission.6.t:0 "Forge a New Realm"
EDG_HER_mission.6.d:0 "Looking back, King Offa of Mercia came close to becoming the hegemon of Britain. Yet this past glory has gradually been tarnished through our repeated submissions. Vikings and Normans saw us as sheep, repeatedly extracting the precious wealth of the Mercians, but we have finally broken free from these shackles of numbness.\n\nFrom the establishment of the Danelaw to the barbaric invasion of the Normans, and from the signing of the 'Magna Carta' to the advent of the League of Cities era, we have experienced much. Now, the Mercians shall yield no more. We are the inheritors of the will of the ancient kingdom of Mercia, and also the new Commonwealth that has rejected British monarchy."

EDG_HER_mission.7.t:0 "Celtic Act"
EDG_HER_mission.7.d:0 "An increasing number of Celts will be brought under our rule. The vast ethnic differences between us make governance extremely difficult, and our governing team is embroiled in endless debate over the Celtic issue. Now, it is time to make the final decision."
EDG_HER_mission.7.a:0 "The lands of Britain are vast enough to accommodate the Celts."
EDG_HER_mission.7.b:0 "Barbarians will always remain barbarians."
EDG_HER_3_7_yes_TT:0 "If this option is chosen, we can pass a decision to partition @IRE Ireland during a war with them."

EDG_HER_mission.8.t:0 "The Emerald Treaty"
EDG_HER_mission.8.d:0 "After losing their unifier's leadership, the lords of Ireland have attached themselves to the banner of the Commonwealth. However, the Emerald Isle should not be a lawless land. We must end past enmities and clearly define their obligations."
EDG_HER_mission.8.a:0 "Let past grievances be washed down with wine, and toast to our friendship."

EDG_HER_mission.9.t:0 "British Unification Process"
EDG_HER_mission.9.d:0 "The establishment of the Mercian Republic has inspired other nations across the British Isles with a yearning for freedom and unity. Through our active diplomacy and military campaigns, neighboring minor states and territories have gradually joined our alliance system as regional lords, collectively resisting external threats. Now, there are no more rivals left in the British Isles; the era of mutual hostility and invasion among British nations is history.\n\nHaving unified the British Isles, a core challenge we now face is the excessive power of the regional lords. These lords have long held local military, economic, and administrative authority, posing a serious threat to the republic's centralization. To consolidate the republican system and strengthen the central government's control, we must take effective measures to address this issue."
EDG_HER_mission.9.a:0 "The age of kings has passed; Britain shall be reborn."
EDG_HER_mission_9_TT:0 "Gain a series of §TCentralization Decisions§!\n\nUnlocks the diplomatic action for Federal District subjects: Reclaim Territory"

EDG_HER_mission.10.t:0 "The Call to Duty"
EDG_HER_mission.10.d:0 "In the old era of England, the north was home to many powerful kingdoms. The ancient kingdom of Northumbria stretched from Edinburgh down to south of the Humber. Our old friend from the Heptarchy era long ago lost any possibility of contending for Britain—it was, unfortunately, vassalized by the very foreigners it had guarded against for centuries, and the wall built to defend against Scotland instead became their protective barrier.\n\nHowever, our spies in Scotland report that Northumbria's relationship with Scotland is not as amicable as it appears on the surface. Among Northumbria's nobility, there are those who share our goal of defending against Scotland. Our northern frontier needs guardians, and Northumbria is our best choice."
EDG_HER_mission.10.a:0 "Before we make arrogant Scotland bow, our wall needs watchers."

EDG_HER_mission.11.t:0 "Stone of Destiny"
EDG_HER_mission.11.d:0 "As an ambitious monarch, Alexander IV never wished to be confined to merely being a King of Scots. He strove to extend the influence of the Golden Lion of Scotland into the heart of England, perhaps aiming for the greatest conquest of England and bestowing the title of the Goddess Britannia upon his future empire. Regrettably, he will never achieve this.\n\nThe campaign against Scotland draws to a close, and the Stone of Scone, symbolizing Scottish royal authority, has been brought here by us. Now, Scotland's fate is ours to decide."
EDG_HER_mission.11.a:0 "This is Scotland's destiny."

EDG_HER_mission.12.t:0 "Forge a British Identity"
EDG_HER_mission.12.d:0 "Celtic society is built upon complex kinship ties and obligations. Within it, the nobility must contribute through success in agriculture, trade, and war to increase their wealth and prestige, which they then use to form or invest in their family or tribe.\n\nThis outdated mode of production creates vast differences between the Celts and ourselves. We should use our wisdom to integrate Celtic folk traditions, allowing these peripheral peoples to fully assimilate into the mainstream society of the Commonwealth."
EDG_HER_mission.12.a:0 "We are as close as family."
EDG_HER_mission_12_TT:0 "Adds the modifier §T'Heed Their Voice'§! to all Insular Christian provinces we own in the Britain region."
EDG_HER_mission_12_2_tt:0 "Randomly changes the culture of one Celtic culture group province to §T'Anglo-Celtic'§!, and adds the §T'Celtic Community'§! modifier to that province and another province of the same culture group."

EDG_HER_mission.100.t:0 "To Our Friendship"
EDG_HER_mission.100.d:0 "To our friendly neighbors, we naturally aspire to freedom and unity."
EDG_HER_mission.100.a:0 "Ah, what joy!"

EDG_HER_flavor_event.1.t:0 "Gathering Clouds"
EDG_HER_flavor_event.1.d:0 "Due to the impact of the Magna Carta, the Midlands region has maintained de facto independence, with city magistrates acquiring extensive privileges. The Mercians gathered here have finally shaken off the rule of Norman nobility brought by William the Conqueror, and order is upheld by the citizenry.\n\nTo this day, these autonomous cities, existing beyond the English crown's authority, still maintain traditions of competition and cooperation—neither losing an inch of ground nor gaining a foot more. Edward III is far more astute than his ineffectual father, and the Scots to the north are watching covetously. The flames of war in Britain are on the brink of igniting. Can Mercia's boroughs survive?"
EDG_HER_flavor_event.1.a:0 "I'm sure the magistrates will have a way."

EDG_HER_flavor_event_1_TT:0 "Due to subsequent mission effects, please do not §R'Deus Vult'§! §TNorth American regions§!."

EDG_HER_flavor_event.2.t:0 "Acquire City Governance Experience"
EDG_HER_flavor_event.2.d:0 "Even ruling a vast empire must begin with small cities; the experience accumulated can greatly benefit us as well."
EDG_HER_flavor_event.2.a:0 "Use administrative power to acquire City Governance Experience"
EDG_HER_flavor_event.2.b:0 "Use diplomatic power to acquire City Governance Experience"
