EDG_string_start_AEL:0 "§YThe Cathars§!\nSince the Bogomils from the East transmitted their doctrines to the Occitan-speaking regions of Southern France, this Gnostic Christian sect flourished in Occitania and directly influenced Northern Italy before the Holy See. In 1203 AD, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade against the rampant "Cathar" heresy. Apart from the Pope, the crusade's greatest supporter was their lord—the King of France—while the Cathars' strongest backer was King Peter II of Aragon, who held extensive lands in Southern France. He believed supporting them would help counter the expanding influence of Paris over Southern France, thereby consolidating his own territories.\nBut when the Catalan Cathars broke away from his kingdom under his successors, would he, if aware in the afterlife, feel remorse? The leader of the Cathars was Count Raymond II of Toulouse, who became the paramount lord of the Languedoc nobility. Before the war, the Count attempted to reach a degree of reconciliation with the Papacy, converting to Catholicism to spare his lands from devastation. However, he continued to secretly harbor Cathars within his territories and surrounding areas, and the war ultimately proved unavoidable.\nThe crusaders advanced toward Languedoc in two columns: the main force marched on Béziers, while a French contingent led by the Bishop of Bordeaux targeted Casseneuil. After a difficult internal struggle, Raymond abandoned Béziers, which he had pledged to defend, leading his main force to Casseneuil and leaving only a small detachment under the Count of Foix to reinforce the formidable Carcassonne. The inexperienced Archbishop of Bordeaux was defeated, while the main crusader force struggled to besiege Carcassonne, the millennial fortress on the Aude River, which stood firm. Subsequent clashes between the crusaders and Cathar forces along the coast yielded no decisive advantage for either side. However, the Cathars' home-ground advantage grew steadily, and the crusaders were plagued by mercenary pay disputes and mutinies among Italian levies.\nKing Peter II of Aragon was pleased with this outcome. He brought the Pope and Raymond VI to the negotiating table. The Pope agreed to withdraw the crusade against Languedoc and accept the nominal conversion of the Southern French nobility, but was forced to relinquish administrative jurisdiction over the Occitan church, retaining only taxation rights on church lands. Overall, however, the Cathars emerged victorious. After the failure of the First Albigensian Crusade, the Cathars took deep root amidst the encirclement of Roman Catholicism. Centered on the County of Toulouse, Cathar influence gradually spread throughout the lower Rhône Valley and Catalonia—at that time, due to the Cathar victory, Raymond VI retained his Provençal possessions in Toulouse. Yet the very existence of the Cathars remained a thorn in the side for both the King of France and the Pope.\nIn the summer of 1256 AD, the Pope and the King of France launched the Second Albigensian Crusade. Learning from the painful lesson of divided forces leading to defeat, the French army assembled at Lyon, while Papal-hired mercenaries advanced toward Valence, planning to converge at Aix, the capital of Provence. The old count's heir, Raymond VII, clearly lacked his father's military acumen. The French king's forces achieved successive victories in the Rhône Valley, with Papal inquisitors following the knights, indiscriminately arresting locals on charges of heresy to extort their meager remaining wealth.\nYet Raymond VII proved wiser in diplomacy. A plea for aid was secretly carried by an envoy to London on the ninth day of the war. Just as King Louis IX "the Saint" was basking in his victories over heretics, the Three Lions banner flew over Caen, Paris became the frontline against the English, and the powerful northern lord, the Duke of Alençon, openly defected to support the English king's occupation of Normandy. With the French army hastily withdrawing northward, the Papal forces were dispersed across the Rhône Valley and lacked unified command among the mercenaries. Raymond VII swiftly reclaimed all his Provençal territories, momentarily riding a wave of triumph.\nMeanwhile, the failures of the two Albigensian Crusades cast an ominous shadow over the Holy See of St. Peter. Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty installed the Archbishop of Regensburg as an antipope, styled Benedict XIII, intensifying the conflict between Crown and Tiara. For Raymond VII, the Papal chaos presented a perfect opportunity. He installed the compliant Bishop of Avignon as the Cathar Pope, proclaiming to his subjects: "The Pope is the successor of St. Peter, entrusted with the keys to heaven by the Heavenly Father, to bind on the journey through Purgatory. The King is blessed by the Heavenly Father to rule all living on earth. Blessed are those who obey the faithful King, for their sins will be confessed in the end."\nThe small town of Avignon was "dedicated" to the Cathar Pope, though this pope was merely an ordinary priest of the town. All bishops reported directly to Raymond VII and his court. In 1250 AD, at the Cathedral of Aix, before a multitude of subjects, Count Raymond VII of Toulouse, Marquis of Provence, was crowned King Raymond I of Arles, formally severing ties with the King of France.\n§YCount Bernard VI de Ventadour of Albi§!\nBernard VI de Ventadour was one of the Cathar leaders during the Albigensian Crusade. The origin of the Count of Albi traces back to the famous troubadour Bernard de Ventadour from Southern France. He served at the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine and fell in love with the duchess. In our history, heartbroken by her marriage to England, he entered a monastery and composed many sorrowful songs. In this alternate timeline, we assume he overcame his heartbreak, wandered to the County of Toulouse, married a maid of Raymond II, and became the court troubadour for Raymond VI.\nWhen the Albigensian Crusade erupted, Bernard's son William "the Fire" volunteered for the count's forces. At the decisive Battle of Sallertaine, he led troops to burn the French king's supplies, earning the epithet "the Fire." William was later granted Albi, becoming William I of Albi. After Toulouse was formally crowned a kingdom, the Ventadour family naturally received the title of count. Due to Albi's strategic importance and the Ventadour family's longstanding influence, they held a significant position at the Arles court.\n§YCathar Archbishop Innocent de Saint-Cyr (Innocent III)§!\nThe Cathar Papacy was abolished in 1399, after which the highest title for Cathar clergy became "Archbishop." The Archbishop's role as spiritual leader existed only within the Avignon castle in the heart of the kingdom, with only this small city directly accountable to him. The position of Archbishop became hereditary within the de Saint-Cyr family, which provided the court chaplains to King Raymond I. The current Archbishop Innocent III is the nephew of the former Archbishop Peter V. Outside the city, the church reported directly to the Arles court through court chaplains. Innocent III knew that despite bearing the title of Archbishop, he differed little from most vassals of the Kingdom of Arles—even though the Cathar Archbishopric nominally had no subordinate relationship with the Kingdom of Arles. Thus, he devoted his life to infiltrating the court at Aix, spending far more time as a guest at the royal palace than residing in Avignon. Though disliked by common-born priests, Innocent III managed to place many of his relatives and disciples within the Arles church, wielding considerable influence.\n§YCount Louis II de Foix of Foix§!\nThe Count of Foix is not actually a vassal of the Kingdom of Arles; he is a count without a king. On this matter, Louis II's ancestors stated that Foix and Toulouse were merely allies, not in any feudal relationship. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Arles, the County of Foix at the foot of the Pyrenees maintained its special status. Though independent, during the two Albigensian Crusades, three nobles of the Foix family served in the Arles army and were granted lands accordingly. The count himself held great prestige in Arles, visiting the court at Aix every winter, claiming merely to seek a comfortable place for the season. Yet the bustling crowds at the Foix palace left the count little leisure, and the king himself occasionally paid personal visits.\n§YThe Le Renard Family§!\nThe Le Renard family is an old noble house of Toulouse. Its ancestors started by trading olive oil and dyes, monopolizing trade routes from Barcelona to Orléans. During the First Albigensian Crusade, despite significant economic losses, the family weathered the crisis with accumulated wealth, while their competitors either went bankrupt or were forced into exile. The third patriarch, Jérôme, successfully connected with the court, not only securing the lucrative court cloth trade but also becoming the primary financier for the court. As Cathar influence gradually took root, with support from successive Kings of Arles, by around 1440, the Le Renard family's commercial network spanned Southern France and extended into Catalonia and Piedmont."

EDG_string_start_IBR_conflict:0 "§YThe Iberian Conflict§!\nInnocent III was perhaps the most zealous pope in launching holy wars since his predecessor Innocent II, yet ironically, his tenure saw little progress in the campaigns against heretics and infidels. While the French-led "Children's Crusade" expanded Christian territories in Tunis, the Cathar ideology swept through Provence and Languedoc, becoming a thorn in the Pope's side. Almost simultaneously, the Almohad Caliphate in Iberia advanced triumphantly. After the fall of Calatrava, the isolated stronghold of the Order of Calatrava, Toledo and Madrid were once again exposed to Muslim armies. Through the Pope's mediation, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia and crusaders from Germany, Northern France, and Italy (though the Occitan crusaders, still fighting the Cathar Count of Toulouse, did not personally reach Iberia) formed a defensive alliance to resist the African advance northward. The Pope hoped the Christian coalition would act in unison, but in reality, his military understanding proved naive. Castilian and Asturian knights quarreled over control of post-crusade territories, while Italian and German "mercenaries" cared more about plundering wealth from the southern coast. The French king hoped the Iberian crusaders, after defeating the Almoravid Muslim forces, would march into Southern France to help suppress the growing Cathar rebellion. The Pope naturally did not oppose any military action against Rome's enemies, be they infidels following a false prophet or stubborn heretics. However, this decision drew opposition from Peter II of Aragon, a key member of the coalition. It was known that Raymond VI of Toulouse was his brother-in-law, but what was unspoken or unacknowledged was that he was the Cathars' greatest ally. A loyal relative helped defend the Aragonese kingdom's hereditary lands in Occitania. If the Count of Toulouse fell, French influence would penetrate his territories, which was utterly unacceptable. Though a Christian, Peter II prioritized his identity as King of Aragon and secretly reached a private accord with the Almohad Sultan.\nAs the armies met at Tolosa, Aragonese envoys infiltrated the Muslim camp, informing the Sultan of the coalition's plan to flank via a small path. The King of Aragon volunteered to guard the main front, but Peter II knew no Muslim forces would come his way. That day, the crusaders attempting the flanking maneuver were ambushed by prepared Muslim forces. The numerically superior Muslims routed the crusaders, inflicting heavy losses on the Castilian vanguard and French knights. Hearing of the vanguard's defeat, the Aragonese retreated orderly, unconcerned about Muslim pursuit. After their victory, the Muslims swiftly moved west along the Tagus River southward to besiege Lisbon. This failed crusade ended with Lisbon, reclaimed in 1147, falling once again to Muslim hands.\nThe crusade's disastrous defeat severely weakened the Kingdom of Castile, as their forces, leading the vanguard, suffered the heaviest losses. King Alfonso IX of León coveted the Castilian throne—even though the Castilian king was his heir and own son, Ferdinand III. A marriage declared illegal by the Pope ultimately pitted father against son, ending in the son's absolute victory—achieved by "accidentally" taking his father's life on the battlefield. To placate hostile Leonese nobles, Ferdinand III sought to promote the inherent ruling power of the House of Ivrea. He revived the title "King of Asturias," using the history of a unified Christian kingdom to consolidate his rule. However, not all nobles were willing to submit to Ferdinand III. They led their soldiers to occupy Galicia, establishing a federal republic formed by local magnates.\nTurning to Aragon, Peter II's protection of the Cathars brought catastrophic disaster to his kingdom after his death. In the pre-Cathar era, religious unity in Aragon was marked by conflict between the Mozarabic rite, adhering to ancient laws, and Roman Catholicism. With the Count of Toulouse crowned King of Arles, many Cathars from Languedoc migrated south along the coast to Catalonia. As Cathar communities grew and the faith's inherent appeal to oppressed commoners increased, Catalonia gradually shifted to the Cathar camp over decades. The Aragonese monarchy's attitude hardened from tolerance to sternness. Aragon was allied with Arles, not with the Cathars. Aragonese bishops repeatedly urged the king to expel unassimilated Cathars back to Arles. Such hostility naturally provoked backlash from Cathar believers. In 1261, Peter II's son, James I, traveled with his court to increasingly hostile Barcelona to raise funds for a campaign against Egypt. The king had agreed with the Ilkhanate Khan to attack Egypt jointly—a clear emulation of the French Tunis Crusade, though "the Conqueror" James I was bolder. However, Catalan resentment toward Papal-promoted crusades was evident, as their ancestors had been crusade targets sixty years prior. James's tax collectors knocked on every door demanding contributions. The king watched his galleys by the shore, oblivious to the peasants' growing anger. Though supported by other Catholic monarchs, James I's fate was sealed. While campaigning against Egypt, he was attacked by formidable Moorish pirates loyal to the Ayyubid Sultan. His fleet was destroyed, he was captured, and ultimately died from Moorish flogging. When news of the king's death reached Barcelona, Cathar masses armed with clubs and hammers stormed the king's tax collectors. After fierce fighting, Cathars seized Catalonia and expelled royal officials. This disastrous expedition led to the decline of the Aragonese kingdom in the Mediterranean, and Catalonia became a major base for the European Cathar movement. With Catalonia's separation, the southern Murcian governor seized the opportunity to capture Valencia. To the west of Aragon, Mozarabic communities also refused Aragonese authority, electing a priest to lead this realm—the only refuge for those unwelcome in the Catholic world. Amidst the wave of disintegration, Aragonese claimants retained only the small fragment of Teruel.\nWhile northern Christian kings were embroiled in internal strife, the Almohad Caliphate, plagued by internal discord and Marinid resistance in northern Morocco, saw its influence shrink to the outskirts of Marrakesh. Hereditary governors originally appointed to rule Iberian territories rushed to declare independence. African hegemony in Iberia once again crumbled. Though governors signed mutual defense pacts vowing "eternal non-aggression," the seeds of discord grew beyond the constraints of paper. Iberia entered another era of warring states. To later historians, the first half of the 13th and 14th centuries became known as the "Third Taifa Period." Over this 150-year span, border conflicts between Christians and Muslims never ceased entirely. The most significant was an attack on Lisbon launched by the Kings of Portugal and Asturias, which ended inconclusively after an over-ambitious advance led to a Muslim ambush south of Coimbra. However, as Cathar influence solidified in Southern France and Catholic states grew weary of crusading, the lands south of the Pyrenees gradually became a relatively independent "small world" detached from the Catholic sphere. Though external interventions occurred, they did not alter the strategic stalemate. Yet when Asturian King Ignatius III launched a crusade against Tulaytulah, the flames of Iberian conflict were reignited."

The fate of the Balkans was decided in a decisive battle at §YSofia§! in 1402. Historical records state that the Battle of Sofia lasted from dawn until dark. As night approached, the Sultan found he had exhausted all his reserves, leaving only his grand tent brightly lit under the night sky. At that moment, the sound of galloping horses and clashing weapons erupted around the tent. The Serbs bound Bayezid I to a plank like prey and paraded him through the streets. The Serbs showed no mercy to the infidel, and "the Lightning" soon emitted his final rumble in a dungeon—just like his father §YMurad I§!, adding another deep stroke to the bloody ledger between Turks and Serbs. The Sultan was defeated and captured. His descendants §Yfragmented the realm§!. After Bayezid I's death, the princes governing §YAydin§! and §YGermiyan§! were the first to rebel, declaring they would no longer accept orders from Edirne. They claimed the old Sultan had secretly left a will before his campaign, dividing the empire equally between them along the Sea of Marmara.\n\n§YPope Eugene IV§! firmly believed rumors of the Ottoman Sultanate's weakness and called upon King §YWładysław III§! of Poland and Holy Roman Emperor §YSigismund I§! to launch a crusade against the various Ottoman states, to rescue Constantinople from the Muslims. King Władysław III of Poland had dreamed since childhood of personally cutting off Ottoman heads and became the crusade's most ardent participant. At the time, Sigismund was mired in the Hussite turmoil in Bohemia and could not spare forces but promised his son-in-law, Count §YAlbrecht§! of Württemberg, would lead an army from Hungary and Bohemia to join the crusade. The §YSerbian Empire§! also pledged to join the war. Ruling Serbia, Albania, and Bulgaria alongside powerful nobles, the Serbian Emperor was a major power in the Balkans. Emperor Stefan John Uroš promised to aid the Catholic crusade in a holy war against the Ottoman regime of §YMurad II§!, who had made Edirne his capital.\n\n§YMurad II§! was immersed in recent grief over the loss of his son, sorrow so overwhelming that he remained secluded for months, merely hoping a general could resolve all crises as reports piled up like snowflakes. But his son—the future §YMuhammad II§!—told him, "If you believe you are the Sultan, then lead your army; if you believe you have relinquished the authority granted by Allah and passed the Sultan's duties to me, then I command you to lead your army." Murad II ultimately led his forces against the crusaders and successfully bribed §YEmperor Stefan Uroš§! of Serbia. Murad II persuaded the Serbian Emperor that the crusaders' true target was Hungarian-held Belgrade, not Constantinople, and warned him with a tale from a distant silk-producing land about the consequences of lending passage to ill-intentioned neighbors. He also promised not to support independence for §YBulgaria§! and §YAlbania§!, urging the Emperor to cut off crusader supplies and retreat routes and launch surprise attacks. Ultimately, with the Serbian Emperor's betrayal, the crusade failed once again. Albrecht and Władysław III §Yfell in battle§!. Sigismund lost his most capable heir, and §YPoland§!, deprived of its king, returned to a state of de facto §Yfragmentation§!. But for Murad II, his lifelong regret was failing to personally crush those two insolent traitors in Anatolia and use their skulls as goblets for the freshest yogurt.\n\nThe young Muhammad ascended the Sultan's throne, but not all relatives were pleased to see a green youth issuing commands over them—at least Prince §Yİbrahim§! was unwilling, and he happened to have capable allies: the §YBektashi Order§! and the §YJanissaries§! they had infiltrated. Prince İbrahim had long conspired with them, even accused by contemporary historians of secretly converting to §YShia Islam§! and becoming a follower of the so-called Twelver Imams. Muhammad II's accession was chaotic, and as the Ottoman Empire's decade of turmoil had just begun to settle, his two insolent uncles had reached a fragile ceasefire with him. Muhammad II could scrape together only meager funds from the treasury to reward the Janissaries. Dissatisfied, they carried a large cauldron as a war drum to demonstrate before the Sultan's palace. Muhammad II had to borrow a large sum from the §YAkhī Brotherhood§! to secure their temporary loyalty. Of course, the loan came at a price: the Sultan had to mortgage the tax farming rights of two provinces outside §YAnkara§! to obtain that wealth—after all, that land had just been seized from the traitorous Germiyan. Yet small favors did not sway all. Prince İbrahim, conspiring with the Bektashi Order, incited a mutiny. But as the saying goes, the tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not cease. Before Prince İbrahim finalized the mutiny timing, a soldier's unauthorized killing of a passerby led to his arrest, causing his battalion to believe their plot was exposed prematurely and storm the palace. Since it began with crowds carrying a large cauldron demanding rewards for "those who received no bounty," it became informally known as the §Y"Cauldron Mutiny"§!. However, the young but shrewd Muhammad II did not wait idly. He had secretly ordered provincial troops to advance on the capital. As the Janissaries clamored, ambushers emerged from the streets, killing any Janissary found outside their barracks. Prince İbrahim knew launching a mutiny in Edirne was now futile, so he led some still-obedient Janissaries eastward to seize several eastern provinces. After plundering Bolu for supplies, they used a forged Sultan's order to enter Sinop. The Sinop commander, seeing they were Janissaries, let them in without suspicion—his head hanging from the city walls was proof of his folly. In Edirne, the Bektashi Order, accused of colluding with İbrahim, faced a great purge. The Sultan chose a compliant old man to lead the "long-tested" but hollowed-out order. §YGermiyan§!, §YAydin§!, and §YSinop§! were the Sultan's enemies—just like Cairo, Venice, Budapest, and Constantinople. Muhammad II looked around and could rely only on his tortoiseshell-and-emerald-inlaid scimitar and his seemingly §Yboundless ambition§!."
    
EDG_string_start_SMO:0 "§YThe Republic of Smolensk§!\nThe Republic of Smolensk was established in 1407 when the local merchant veche council overthrew the tyrannical Rurikid prince and founded a veche republic. However, the veche continued repressive domestic policies, treating the nation's agriculture and handicrafts as its colony and exploiting peasants and low-level artisans to the extreme, eventually leading to uprisings by freeholders and townspeople. The rebellious peasants and townspeople formed an alliance later named the United Front, which, after overthrowing the merchant veche, established a government that rejected the nobility and formed a Hundred-Member Council.\n\nYet the fledgling Republic of Smolensk failed to fully expel the nobility; even the Republican Council harbored many conservatives who, while exercising power on behalf of peasants, amassed vast wealth and owned sprawling estates. Leveraging their economic strength, conservatives and residual noble factions expanded their political influence and gradually dominated the council.\n\nThe power of the Republic's Consul soon swelled beyond measure. Within the Hundred-Member Council, representatives willing to speak for the common people became few and far between. The laws offered almost no protection for peasants and low-level artisans, instead granting increasing privileges to large landowners and wealthy merchants. Tenant farmers who lost their land and could not pay rent were sold into slavery; low-level artisans injured at work had to compensate their employers heavily for machine downtime and lost time. The military junta colluded with wealthy merchants, shielding each other, exchanging favors, and jointly oppressing the masses of peasants and artisans.\n\nDomestically, the junta maintained a repressive regime, plunging the common people into misery. Anyone critical of the junta faced secret arrest. Smolensk peasants sardonically remarked, "Why is the government angry? We merely stated what they did." Yet externally, the junta proved weak and ineffectual. In the war against the Prince of Chernigov in 1433, the Republic lost half its territory, while the junta's most vigorous action during the conflict was suppressing "traitors" who discussed its strategic failures.\n\nIn 1440, Yury Rostislavich became Consul of the Republic and further tightened exploitation of the masses. He decreed that peasants whose land was requisitioned must pay administrative fees to the government, and conscripted townspeople had to pay management fees to the military. Even the Rurikid princes lacked such imagination, but during Yury's rule, he achieved "having his cake and eating it too," selling numerous peasants into slavery while demanding they pay a "freedom tax."\n\nThough the junta's oppressive rule cast a terrifying shadow over the Republic, seemingly suppressing all discontent, everyone understood: a storm was brewing on the horizon."
    
EDG_string_start_GBR:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Scotland§!\nThough Scotland was far inferior to its southern rival in both land and population, successive English kings relentlessly sought to infiltrate it. In 1250, King Alexander III of Scotland married Margaret, daughter of John III, who attempted to demand Alexander's homage and tribute. Alexander III sternly refused. Alexander and Margaret's daughter married King Eric II of Norway, bearing a daughter, Princess Margaret, "the Maid of Norway." In 1275, Queen Margaret of Scotland passed away. Seeking a male heir, Alexander III married Yolande of Dreux as his second wife, but during a visit to his new queen, Alexander died falling from a cliff at night. "The Maid of Norway," Margaret, became Alexander III's lawful heir, but this little queen was not only in Norway but also merely five years old—in other words, Scotland had lost its king.\n\nHad little Margaret lived to adulthood and personally sat upon the Stone of Scone as Scotland's monarch, Scottish history might have been different. Yet four years later, news of the young queen's death in Norway reached Caledonia, triggering a storm in Scotland. In 1290, with the death of Margaret, "the Maid of Norway," the Scottish throne was formally vacant. Two main competing families emerged: the Balliol and Bruce factions. After the vacancy, they vied for the succession. To resolve this, Scottish nobles, clergy, and commoner representatives convened a historic assembly in 1291 at Paisley Castle, known as the "Paisley Conference."\n\nAt the conference, delegates from across Scotland engaged in fierce debate and voting, seeking a suitable heir. Over weeks of deliberation, they ultimately selected John Balliol and Robert Bruce as the two most likely candidates. To avoid future vacancies, delegates established an electoral system, with the former royal steward, the House of Stewart, as conveners. According to new rules, future Scottish kings would be elected by nobles and clergy jointly, rather than simply inherited by royal heirs. This decision became a milestone in Scottish history, laying the foundation for its future political system.\n\nAt the Paisley Conference, the Scottish people demonstrated wisdom, resolve, and determination. By establishing an electoral system, they ensured the legitimacy and stability of future Scottish kings, laying a solid foundation for Scotland's independence and development. Yet the vacant Scottish throne attracted another unwelcome spectator—the southern English king, Edward I. Shortly after the Paisley Conference, King Edward I of England intervened in the Scottish succession, attempting to pressure Scottish nobles and clergy with his power and influence. However, his interference gained no Scottish acceptance or support.\n\nUltimately, through the Scottish people's steadfast resistance, Edward I's intervention failed. His actions instead fueled Scottish nationalism, strengthening unity and resistance. The Scottish people not only defended their succession rights but also safeguarded their autonomy and independence.\n\nThough Edward I ultimately failed to claim the Scottish throne, his actions strained Anglo-Scottish relations and injected new momentum into Scotland's independence movement. Henceforth, the Scottish people began building a stronger national consciousness and self-identity, laying the groundwork for Scotland's historic independence movement. Initially, only the Bruce and Balliol families participated in the election, but as the de Umfraville family of Northumbria established itself in northern England, it gradually became a potential contender for the Scottish throne.\n\nScotland, nestled in the northwestern corner of the known world, benefited from its geography, offering better development prospects. Southern English nobles no longer bowed to the crown, while the Scottish crown was not above anyone. Though the three families jostled for influence, thanks to the Stewarts' diplomatic skill and the examples set by former kings Robert Bruce and John Balliol, Scotland stood firm amidst storms. At this moment, St. Andrew watched over Scotland.\n\nAlexander IV was a young and capable monarch. He endured bloody court power struggles in his youth, nearly smothered by his own mother with a pillow, but survived to be crowned King of Scotland. As a prince with an unfortunate childhood, Alexander IV trusted no one; anyone could be used and discarded at any time. Yet he always succeeded in concealing his misdeeds, maintaining a positive personal image that won others' genuine respect, enabling him to implement numerous reforms.\n\nBuilding on Scotland's elective monarchy, Alexander IV established a vibrant new system. He expanded the electoral council's membership, introducing many minor nobles, burghers, and clergy, thereby weakening major nobles' power and expanding the Privy Council's authority to achieve autocratic rule. Since Alexander based his capital in Lothian, this system became known as the Lothian System.\n\nAs an ambitious monarch, Alexander IV was never content merely being King of Scotland. He constantly sought to extend the Scottish Lion's influence into England's heartland. Perhaps he would achieve the greatest conquest of England and bestow the title of Goddess of Britannia upon his future empire.\n\n§YThe Kingdom of England§!\nThe damage inflicted by "Lackland" John upon England did not cease with his ascent to heaven. The Magna Carta became a talisman for English nobles, and victory in the First Barons' War further cemented these privileges. In 1216, King John died amidst shock and rebellion, and his son Henry III was crowned. However, the intervening French Dauphin Louis, allied with rebellious barons, defeated the royal army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings, where the conflict had unfolded a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding local noble power. In the early years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a pawn manipulated by the earls, who enjoyed far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts. Some even secretly conspired to support the king's cousin, Eleanor of Brittany, for the throne. Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, reached a superficial reconciliation with the king, but underlying tensions persisted, erupting completely in 1258.\n\nA year earlier, Henry III led the royal guard to victory at Rouen, reclaiming control of Normandy. Henry III then demanded expansion of the royal standing army, requiring additional funding and higher feudal taxes. That spring, when Henry III sought parliamentary grants to enlarge the army, English nobles led by the Earls of Norfolk, Gloucester, and Leicester demanded broader devolution of power in exchange for the funds. The conflict between king and earls exploded, triggering the Third Barons' War.\n\nThe Third Barons' War ended with the Earl of Leicester's victory at the Battle of Lewes and subsequent march into London. Like his predecessor, Henry III was defeated by angry lords. The Earls of Leicester and Norfolk were both elevated to dukes. Meanwhile, the Scottish noble Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, seized lands around his father's barony in Northumberland, declaring, "In Scotland, I am Earl of Angus; in England, Earl of Northumberland." Defeated in the baronial war, John III had limited reach over Northumberland and tacitly accepted its semi-independent status. In 1272, Henry III, "Defender of Normandy," died at Westminster, and his eldest son, the valiant Edward I, took up the king's scepter.\n\nMeanwhile, the northern Scottish situation evolved subtly. Despite a failed claim to the throne, Edward I was not content to stand idly by. In the summer of 1292, Edward I invaded Scotland. The Scots allied with France, forcing Edward I into a two-front war. Though England achieved tactical victories, the advance stalled. Increasing taxes on wool and wine made the king increasingly unpopular. The war ended with England's withdrawal. In 1307, Edward I, leader of the Ninth Crusade and brilliant military commander, "Hammer of the Welsh," died, and Edward II succeeded.\n\nEdward II's reign could hardly be described as mediocre. Ever-expanding noble power increasingly confined royal authority to southeastern England, effectively making him the Earl of London. His favorite, the Earl of Cornwall, was exiled twice under pressure from nobles led by the king's relative, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Defeat in the Northumberland border war and the Great Famine of 1315-1317 dealt heavy blows to the troubled kingdom. After the king's final attempt to break free from unruly nobles inevitably failed, and his last favorite, the Earl of Winchester, was defeated and executed, Edward II's reign ended. His son Edward III inherited the heavy crown, but England's true rulers were Queen Dowager Isabella of France (the main force behind her husband's deposition) and her lover, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, along with their Council of Earls. Edward III was far more capable than his ineffectual father, but his situation was even more precarious."

EDG_string_start_TTS:0 "§YSouthern Italy§!\nSicily was Rome's first colony, the Mediterranean's most radiant pearl, its beating heart, and the sole territory of the Roman Empire still functioning—though it neither submitted to Constantinople nor obeyed Rome. The two main contenders for the Sicilian throne—Tancred of Lecce, illegitimate son of Roger III, and Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor—fought to a stalemate. After prolonged negotiations under papal oversight, they were forced to sign the unsatisfying Peace of Amalfi, stipulating the partition of the Kingdom of Sicily: the Hauteville family retained mainland Italian territories, known as the "Peninsular Sicily" throne, while the Hohenstaufens held the island of Sicily, called "Trinacria" after its three-legged emblem.\n\nYet neither monarchy endured. On the peninsula, the greatly weakened Hauteville family faced challenges from other Sicilian noble families, who claimed Tancred of Lecce, as a bastard, had no right to Roger III's inheritance and that the legitimate Hauteville line was extinct. Tancred himself crushed four or five such rebellions, but upon his death and the succession of his son William III, the persistent Hohenstaufens again stirred internal strife in Peninsular Sicily, aiming to fragment it for future invasion. This time, the Hautevilles did not prevail. The throne of Peninsular Sicily was overthrown; in 1260, the aging William III was permitted to retain only the titles of Duke of Apulia and Lecce. The Norman dynasty of Southern Italy dissolved. Meanwhile, the Hohenstaufens on Sicily faced an unexpected adversary—the Byzantine Empire—just before their planned invasion. Strictly speaking, the "Sicilian Expedition" was led by a Genoese mercenary commander in Byzantine service, Andrea di Savoia. The Hohenstaufens focused on Germany; Sicily, though important, was distant and governed by viceroys. The island remained coveted, most notably by Walter III, Count of Brienne, son-in-law of the Hautevilles. After the Byzantine Empire's collapse in the Fourth Crusade, many Greeks fleeing turmoil crossed the Strait of Otranto to Sicily, establishing large communities in key coastal cities like Syracuse and Messina.\n\nIn 1254, Conrad IV died, and his illegitimate brother Manfred usurped the Sicilian throne from his nephew Conradin. This severed Sicily from German support, loosening Hohenstaufen rule. Greek communities became a ticking time bomb within the kingdom. In 1266, through Genoese mediation, Greeks in Messina and Syracuse took up arms at the vesper bells of Sicilian churches, seizing the eastern and western coasts. Syracuse Cathedral was engulfed in flames. Prepared, General di Savoia saw the signal fires and landed his troops on Sicilian shores. Manfred disappeared—some say he hid in a mountain village, others that he perished in a shipwreck fleeing Sicily. For the first time since Archimedes' death, Sicily's coasts belonged to Greeks.\n\nSicily's shores swarmed with Greeks who had fled Latin rule only to head toward Latins. After the Fourth Crusade, victory's horn sounded in Sicily. Andrea di Savoia styled himself "Protector of the Sicilian Greeks," but beyond Sicily, he was called the "Tyrant of Sicily." Yet this king did not fully control Sicily. In the mountains, staunchly Catholic families held their lands, calling themselves "Mountain Folk" and "true Sicilians," while labeling Greeks "Syracusans"—colonizers like the ancient city-state, enemies of true Sicilians. In Syracuse, the tyrant struggled to balance endless quarrels among Greek city representatives. He and his successors, generations of Sicilian tyrants, guarded this beating heart. But could this isolated island truly remain unscathed by the tides? This peculiar system persisted over a century, with Greeks and Sicilians living as adversaries on the same land. The tyrant's authority waned; the Protector's influence declined. The sole consensus among Greek cities was resisting infidel infiltration. Since Manfred's death, the distant Hohenstaufens in Germany could no longer project power onto this sunlit island. Little did they know, their greatest threat came from their fractured Balkan homeland.\n\nIn 1411, Michael Angelos, a prince of the exiled Epirote dynasty in Italy, became son-in-law to the Doge of Venice. Renowned in Venice for eloquence and boldness, to counter Genoese influence over Mediterranean trade routes, Michael Angelos led a fleet core of Swiss and Lombard mercenaries to land at Syracuse. Beforehand, his lieutenant Paolo Nosati infiltrated Sicilian mountains, claiming to be a Catholic crusader come to rescue them from Greeks. Sicilian mountain families, believing him, provided detailed maps and garrison information, and after Michael's landing, offered supplies. Yet they were betrayed from the start. Michael had not come to save them, but to overthrow Genoese masters and establish Venetian rule. Though Michael repeatedly promised equal autonomy for Catholics and Greeks after seizing power, Sicilians despised his duplicity. Meanwhile, a legend spread in Sicily: Manfred had not fled and left a posthumous son raised by local Catholics. Even if such a child existed, he would be long dead, but this did not stop "true Sicilians" from seeking a "true Hohenstaufen king." Like the Strait of Tunisia, Sicily remained perpetually turbulent.\n\nWhen Sicilian Emperor Isaakios IV died in 1443, the 9-year-old Isaakios V succeeded, with real power held by Theodore Vatatzes. Young, capable, and—crucially—an ambitious militarist, Theodore enjoyed support from most military nobles. In November 1443, Theodore gave Isaakios V a supreme gift: he deposed him and, backed by military nobles, became "Lord Protector," commanding all military and state affairs. Theodore formed a Protectorate Council of military noble commanders, appointed by the Protector himself, to govern regional military and administrative matters."
    
EDG_string_start_MRK:0 "§YThe Almohads§!\nThe fates of Iberia and the Maghreb hang by the same thread. Over centuries of Taifa periods, whenever Christians sought to reconquer the peninsula's south, a powerful Marrakesh-based dynasty stood in their way. When Christians retreated, Iberia slowly reverted to a Taifa pattern. The Later Umayyads, Almoravids, and Almohads all fell victim to this cycle. Since the 13th century, the Mediterranean coast has been ablaze with scattered revolts gradually stripping the empire's flesh. Almohad control shrank to the environs of Marrakesh. In 1203, Tunisia fell; in 1205, Kabylia and the Algiers coast defected to the last scion of the Fatimid family; in 1215, the Marinid rebellion of the Zanata tribe struck a heavy blow to the declining empire. In 1248, the Marinids used a feigned surrender to assassinate the Almohad Sultan; Fez by the Rif Mountains raised the Zanata banner, and even inland Tafilalt was seized. To the east, the Marinids; to the west, the Almohads—like the morning sun overshadowing the dusk. The Marinids coveted remaining Almohad lands but hesitated due to the threat from the east posed by the Later Fatimids. In 1258, the Marinid Sultan launched a southern campaign toward Marrakesh. Almohad court women wept daily, praying for a true Mahdi to save them. Perhaps their prayers were answered, or fate intervened: Sultan Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq passed away in camp, summoned by Allah. Seeing unusual commotion outside the city, the Almohads sallied forth and routed the Zanata coalition. The Saadi ruler of Tafilalt swiftly realigned with the Almohads. Thereafter, intermittent warfare persisted between the Marinids and the revitalized Almohads, each supported by Iberian allies or maintaining ties with the Later Fatimids. Thus, the Maghreb maintained a delicate, fragile balance.\n\n§YThe Later Fatimid Dynasty§!\nSulayman ibn Dawud, descendant of Fatimah and Ali, the Most Exalted Sayyid, the last of the Fatimid line. In 1185, an unexpectedly pregnant mother was smuggled out of Cairo by night, and thus Prince Sulayman was born in freedom, preserving the Fatimid bloodline—his birth seen as Allah's grace. In youth, he was captured and placed under house arrest by the Ayyubids. To the Kurds, he, like his father, should remain a caged bird. Yet infidel turmoil gave this Imam's heir an opportunity. In 1205, on a Cairo night, Prince Sulayman and a few loyal attendants slipped away amidst unrest, evading Ayyubid surveillance. Leading a band more akin to bandits than an army, he rode west, bypassing Christian-held Tunis to reach the Maghreb where his ancestors founded their dynasty. He trusted his judgment. At that time, the Almohads, embroiled in Tangiers' conflicts, had little reach eastward. Kabylia and Tlemcen cities followed their own lords; Barbary Coast order neared collapse. The prince raised his banner, and Ismailis discontent with the Almohads and Sunni nobles who once clung to them now harbored ulterior motives, welcoming their Imam incarnate. Once, the Fatimids rose from the Maghreb coast; today, he was born to lead the Maghreb's Shiites. Prince Sulayman arrived with but eight riders; by the time he arrayed his forces outside Kabylia, tens of thousands followed. News of Kabylia's fall spread like a winter gale; Maghreb cities surrendered in succession. The planned "holy war" by Crusaders in Tunis against the Maghreb also fizzled due to major defeat in Egypt.\n\n§YThe Maghreb Crusade§!\nThe 1187 Siege of Jerusalem was a feat worthy of inscription for Saladin, but for the Crusaders, a bitter defeat. Jerusalem's fall to Muslims stunned Christians. King Richard I of England, who had pledged to crusade, defaulted due to another English noble revolt, vying with King Philip II of France for crusade leadership, casting a shadow over the Third Crusade. In 1192, Saladin's defeat of Emperor Frederick III's forces at Acre marked the Third Crusade's failure. Crusaders were driven to isolated coastal fortresses, the last remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Frederick III, returning disgruntled, proclaimed to Christendom that the next crusade would target Egypt, the Muslim heart—its fall would doom Saladin's empire.\n\nIn 1220, a youth from Cloyes claimed only the most devout young could truly reclaim Jerusalem. Historically known as "Stephen of Cloyes," he claimed divine revelation: Jesus commanded him to raise a crusade. But the cunning "Fox" Philip II was aged, so Stephen turned to Crown Prince Louis, Count of Artois. Louis, disheartened by the First Barons' War and troubled by Cathar infiltration in the south, ultimately believed this youth with nothing but followers. With the crown prince's support, the Templars, mainly French knights, backed this crusade—it was a genuine "French Crusade," free from imperial interference. In spring 1121, the army crossed Switzerland southward, bypassing Cathar-held areas, sailed from Genoa, but not directly to Egypt—instead toward Tunis to secure a springboard. When Tunis lookouts saw endless sails from the north, they never imagined becoming a Christian landing target. After symbolic resistance, defenders were expelled. Tunis governor Abu Zakariya Yahya was captured; his brother Abdullah gathered remnants, holding Kairouan against Crusaders in Tunis, appealing to Almohad lords for aid. However, mired in Moroccan troubles, the Almohads sent only a thousand-strong contingent, offering little substantial help—to them, the Hafsids in Tunis were as bothersome as the Crusaders, adopting a watchful stance. In winter 1121, Kairouan fell; its Great Mosque was plundered. The spiritual center of North African Muslims now flew Christian banners—undoubtedly a major Christian victory.\n\nAfter taking Tunis, a major rift emerged within the Crusade. The Templars advocated capturing Tripoli and Benghazi along the coast from Tunis to open the path to Egypt—the logical best route. Stephen of Cloyes and mercenaries hired by the French king argued for using sea power to land directly at Alexandria, bypassing Ayyubid forces. The former supported this out of "devotion to divine revelation"; the latter simply because Tunis and Kairouan's wealth no longer satisfied their appetite. To the Templars, this plan was heretical fantasy. In spring 1122, the Crusade split in two, swearing on silver tablets that conquered lands would belong to the occupiers.\n\nBut the Ayyubid campaign did not proceed as either side anticipated. Contrary to Templar plans, Stephen of Cloyes' landing caused significant trouble for Muslims. While Templars and Muslims faced off outside Benghazi, the French landing cut Ayyubid supply lines, trapping Muslim forces in water-scarce Cyrenaica. Ayyubid Sultan Al-Kamil pinned hopes on a new Mamluk army to recapture Alexandria, but its commander, Sayf al-Din Ali, upon receiving authorization, first decided to abandon Cairo.\n\nThis was a bold gamble—for the young general, the Ayyubid dynasty, and the Muslim world. To save the Cyrenaican army, the retreat route must be opened; to open it, Alexandria must be retaken; to retake Alexandria, Crusader main forces must be lured out; to lure them, sufficient bait was needed to draw them into a trap. The day Cairo was abandoned, its inhabitants fled the forsaken city amid flames, weeping, shouts, and curses. Most chose to ascend the Nile to Upper Egypt. The Mamluk army marched west to Damanhur, while a young "prisoner" named Sulayman ibn Dawud headed west amid chaos. Amid the chaotic crowds, mercenaries indeed descended upon the undefended city, while Stephen of Cloyes returned to Tunis to lead "holy warriors" mobilized by victory's banner for a share of spoils. Left-behind gold and jewels became new Crusader plunder. Almost simultaneously, on a night with a crescent moon, General Sayf al-Din Ali's Mamluks recaptured Alexandria, instantly reversing the war. Now it was the Christians, not Muslims, cut off. Crusaders, just celebrating, faced doom. Mercenary leaders agreed to retreat to Acre, Christianity's last Levantine stronghold. But unwilling to abandon Egyptian loot, carts laden with silk and jewels slowed their retreat. They were overtaken west of Suez—alas, they were not Moses, and the pursuing Mamluks would not be swallowed by Red Sea waters like Pharaoh. When news of the seaborne Crusade's annihilation arrived, the Templars were one step from taking Benghazi. Exhausted defenders, heartened by the Mamluk victory, held firm, while Templars outside wavered, ultimately abandoning the siege. The "French Crusade" ended anticlimactically. As agreed, Stephen of Cloyes and the Templar Grand Master divided lands at Djerba: north of the island became the Kingdom of Tunisia, ruled by Stephen as king; south fell under Templar control."
    
EDG_string_start_HAB:0 "§YThe House of Habsburg§!\nThe House of Babenberg still ruled the Margraviate of Austria, while Tyrol and Carinthia belonged to the House of Zähringen. Although Rudolf I of the Habsburgs displayed remarkable prowess, the Babenberg line did not die out, so the Habsburgs continued to expand within Swabia. Amid the collapse of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, they seized vast Swabian lands, becoming the Counts of Württemberg. In later periods, they stood as the largest vassal under the Duke of Franconia, dominating Swabia, yet unfortunately suffered defeat against the Swiss, losing their ancestral seat, the Eagle's Nest.\nThe former Count of Württemberg, Albrecht, married the daughter of Emperor Sigismund and was designated as Sigismund's heir. However, Albrecht perished in the Varna Crusade against the Turks. His posthumous son, Ladislaus, was too young to govern, so Frederick III of Württemberg assumed the regency.\nHeinrich V, Duke of Franconia, was aged and childless. He married his daughter to Count Frederick III of Württemberg and, with the consent of the Franconian noble council, designated Frederick III as heir to the Duchy of Franconia. Upon Heinrich V's death, the Habsburgs would rule Franconia. However, prolonged internal strife and imperial negotiations gradually weakened the Duke of Franconia's control over his domain. Although the Habsburgs of Württemberg were the most powerful vassals within the duchy, they could not fully dominate the entire territory.\nThough the Babenberg dynasty of Austria persisted into the 15th century, with the death of Ernst IV, the Babenberg saga within the Holy Roman Empire reached its end. At that time, Count Frederick III of Württemberg of the House of Habsburg, as Ernst IV's son-in-law, had been designated heir to the Austrian March. They would have the opportunity to enter Austria and personally write a new legend.\nThe House of Habsburg would have the chance to inherit Franconia and then the Babenberg legacy in Austria, and could even lay claim to the Bohemian crown, thereby becoming the most powerful prince within the Empire.\n"
    
EDG_string_start_BUL:0 "§YThe Serbian Empire and Bulgaria§!\nSince Uroš V was usurped by Grand Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, Serbia had no legitimate heir. The only male descendant of the Nemanjić dynasty was Simon Uroš, the separatist ruler of Epirus, and his progeny. A decade ago, the successor to a generation of ambitious rulers, Stefan Lazarević "the Tall," received the title of Despot from the Byzantine Empire and declared Serbia's release from Ottoman vassalage. Sultan Bayezid I "the Lightning" led his troops to meet them, culminating in the decisive Battle of Sofia in 1402. Bayezid I was defeated, captured, and later died in prison—like his father Murad I, perishing at Serbian hands. Leaderless, the empire saw each governor-prince believe himself worthy of the Sultan's throne, plunging into bloody civil war that continues to this day, preventing the reunification of the Ottoman Sultanate.\nMeanwhile, Grand Prince Stefan was hailed as a savior by fellow Christians, Bulgarians and Albanians, for delivering them from Muslim oppression. He was proclaimed Protector of Bulgaria and Grand Prince of Albania, and recognized as heir to the throne of Uroš V. Constantine II, who ruled the Vidin region under Serbian suzerainty, was reinstated as King of Bulgaria. He divorced his former queen to marry Stefan Lazarević's young and beautiful daughter, Sophia, but his power was heavily constrained by the Serbs. At that time, Serbia campaigned against infidels to the south, subdued Bulgaria to the east, and rivaled Hungary to the north, emerging as a major power in Southeastern Europe. After the fragmentation of the Ottoman Sultanate, various forces in the Balkans and Anatolia descended into chaos.\nIn 1423, Serbian Emperor Stefan Lazarević was assassinated during a hunt. While chasing a doe, the emperor became separated from his retinue and never returned to camp by sundown. That night, after a thorough search of the woods, they found the emperor's heart pierced as if he were hunted game. A man dressed as a hunter was arrested, insisting he had accidentally shot the unfortunate sovereign. However, the only certainty was that the Serbian emperor was dead. Childless, the throne became as attainable as a captured doe to all Serbian nobles.\nUltimately, Serbian nobles reached a compromise acceptable to all: elevating John Uroš, former Despot of Epirus and a distant relative of the last "legitimate" Serbian emperor, Uroš V, to the throne. But by then, John Uroš was gray-haired and retired from worldly affairs. After abdicating the Epirus throne to his son-in-law, he resided in a monastery, unmoved even when his son-in-law lost the kingdom to Latins. John Uroš was less enthroned as Serbian emperor and more kidnapped from his monastery like a prisoner. However, a disengaged king suited their interests. The privileges granted to Serbian nobles by Stefan Dušan expanded rapidly during John Uroš's reign, bypassing boundaries. The Serbian Empire saw its decrees ignored and regions governed autonomously, effectively fragmenting into feudal states. Serbia's Balkan hegemony began to crumble. The following winter, Alexander II, long subordinate to Serbian power and compliant, passed away, succeeded by his son Alexander III as King of Bulgaria.\nThe Bulgarian court had split into the "Prince's Faction" and the "Queen's Faction." Prince Constantine, born to the old queen, was initially to be expelled with her but retained as heir due to the queen's failure to produce a child. The Prince's Faction versus Queen's Faction reflected tensions between Bulgarian nobles and Serbian garrisons. The queen extensively appointed Serbs as confidants, securing loyalty with high offices and riches, keeping the Bulgarian faction at a disadvantage. However, as Serbian royal authority waned, noble rivalries replaced unified royal command. Despite the queen's diplomatic skills, Serbian divisions widened. Prince Constantine awaited his opportunity.\nDuring the crusade against the Ottoman Rumelia launched by Polish King Władysław III, Serbian Emperor Stefan John Uroš initially permitted Catholic crusaders passage through his lands to attack the Ottomans. Yet, swayed by Ottoman persuasion, he betrayed the crusaders, cutting off supplies, closing gates to remnants, and extinguishing any hope of victory. Beyond tarnishing Serbia's European reputation, this betrayal yielded little territorial gain. However, Mehmed II sent many treasures to Belgrade—mostly spoils from the Battle of Thessaloniki. Emperor Stefan cared little for Latin opinion; in his mind, he had again defended Serbian hegemony in the Balkans, which mattered most.\nIn 1444, Skanderbeg's Albanian rebellion against Serbia intensified. Serbian forces in Bulgaria were heavily redeployed. Sensing the moment, on the night of November 10, the prince led troops to surround the palace. The palace guard surrendered at the sight of his face. Queen Sophia was imprisoned in the dungeon; Alexander III was forced to abdicate and placed under house arrest. Constantine IV was crowned Tsar, declaring independence from the Serbian Empire. Bulgaria fired the first shot against Serbia.\nConstantine IV was a military genius. Educated in Byzantine and Ottoman courts, he deeply understood advanced systems. He initiated sweeping domestic reforms: abolishing noble privileges, replacing them with royally appointed officials for local governance, and centralizing supreme power in the monarch. Moreover, the national army no longer relied on feudal ties but became a force directly answerable to the Tsar, enabling him to exhaust domestic manpower for war. He was unlikely to lose against the decaying Serbian Empire and would continually pursue military reforms. However, Constantine IV distrusted foreigners, believing only Bulgarians and fellow South Slavs were reliable, a principle applied to his army. He also coveted the dying Byzantine Empire and its capital, Constantinople, aspiring to enter the city as successor to Simeon the Great and rebuild a great Bulgarian Empire.\n\n"

EDG_string_start_KIE:0 "§YThe Kievan Rus Civil War§!\nIn 1380, Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, with Timur's aid, defeated the powerful emir Mamai of the Great Horde, gaining control over the core territories of the Golden Horde and becoming its Khan. However, the Horde had endured bloody internal strife, weakening its grip over the western Kievan Rus region. The Prince of Kiev, Ivan I of the Rurik dynasty, became the Horde's agent in Kievan Rus, yet he harbored his own ambitions.\nBy the late 14th century, as the Golden Horde declined, Ivan I consolidated his position in Kievan Rus, successfully repelling invasions from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and even seizing the principalities of Turov and Minsk. Ivan I died of illness in Kiev in 1440 at age 83. His son, Andrei I, proved incompetent and despotic. At Ivan's funeral, he disrespected the feudal rights of other princes, and to curry favor with the Horde, imposed oppressive levies across Kievan Rus, sparking the civil war that began in December 1443. The principalities of Galicia-Volhynia, the Zaporizhian Hetmanate, and Chernigov declared independence, each claiming the right to become the new Grand Prince of Kiev, plunging into a chaotic struggle for the city. Meanwhile, the Prince of Turov and the Archbishop of Minsk watched from the sidelines, striving to defend against northern Lithuanians without the Grand Prince's protection.\nIn the civil war that erupted in 1443, Prince Ivan of Galicia-Volhynia emerged as the most likely victor. Although princely authority in Galicia-Volhynia had traditionally been weak, Ivan's genius temporarily subdued the major nobles, unleashing significant military potential that ultimately secured his triumph. However, victory in the civil war did not guarantee lasting prosperity for Galicia-Volhynia, as it would face formidable challenges from the Polish successor, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\nThe Zaporizhian Hetmanate, based along the Black Sea coast of the Crimean Peninsula, was a polity led by Bogomil Cossacks. They seized control of this steppe region when Kievan authority waned, developing their own political and military power. Possessing the most formidable cavalry among Rus principalities, they shared the Cossack passion for raiding. Zaporizhians cherished freedom and, after exploring various political systems, ultimately rejected Rus princes, electing their supreme leader. The Ataman (chieftain) at the time believed participation in the civil war offered little benefit, but his Cossack commanders overwhelmingly demanded independence and entry into the conflict. Nearly unanimous at the council, the commanders compelled the Ataman to join the fray.\nA unified Principality of Chernigov had vanished in the early 14th century. Originally ruled by the Rurikids, its rulers rebelled against the Golden Horde and were eradicated. Reestablished in the early 15th century, the princely title was granted to the dominant local family, the Chernigovs, who ruled the city itself. Prince Yevgeni, who succeeded in 1411, initially had no desire to contest Kievan supremacy but refused to submit to Galicia-Volhynia or Zaporizhia. In 1443, he issued a declaration of self-defense, emphasizing Chernigov's defensive stance in the conflict."

EDG_string_start_MLO:0 "§YThe Duke of Lombardy and the Vicar of Italy§!\nMarriages, plots, patronage, alliances - the rise of the Visconti family is inseparable from these terms. Before expelling the della Torre family from Milan in 1262, the Viscontis were an obscure Genoese clan. Through cunning, they seized the heart of Lombardy, becoming the Empire's greatest Italian vassal. Naturally, the Duke of Lombardy was not content ruling merely Lombardy; he aspired to be master of all Italy. In 1395, Duke Gian Visconti, after poisoning his infamous uncle Bernabò, ascended the throne. When petitioning the Imperial court, the Emperor appointed him as his proxy in Italy, a clear gesture of favor. Duke Gian cherished this imperial grace; the Emperor's charter paved the way for his expansion across Italy. Numerous northern Italian towns swiftly fell before his forces; the Viscontis stood one step from ruling northern Italy, with Venice and Florence as the last bastions of resistance. Yet fate proved cruel: a plague claimed his life.\nLombardy's rapid expansion ultimately provoked widespread hostility within the Empire. Though traditionally imperial allies, internal turmoil struck a near-fatal blow to this nascent power. The younger son, Filippo, poisoned his mentally unstable elder brother to usurp the Duchy of Lombardy. To reclaim his father's stature, he reversed previous policies, forging close ties with guilds, granting guild leaders noble titles in exchange for their "contributions." Gold flowing from guilds poured into mercenaries' pockets. Since 1414, Filippo had nearly fully restored his father's position. Modena, Ferrara, Montferrat, and Bologna, which had formed a coalition against him, now submitted. The Republic of Verona became Lombardy's puppet. To secure his loyalty, the Emperor transferred the electoral title of the rebellious Archbishop of Mainz to the Archbishop of Milan, firmly under Visconti control, and bestowed upon Lombardy the title "Vicar of Italy." Effectively, he was informally recognized as King of Italy—an achievement even his father had not attained.\nDuke Filippo relied on guilds to extract Italian wealth, and guilds naturally demanded power in return. Within the academy established by the Duke, scholars advocated emulating ancient Greek arts, creating an "ideal state" governed by philosophers through top-down governance. Their ideas found fertile ground in Lombardy. Philosophers could not directly claim the Visconti throne, but the Duke saw no issue in presenting himself as a philosopher-king. In 1440, Lombardy convened its first "Council of Sages," chaired by the Duke himself, with participants including scholars from the Milan Academy and esteemed notables from autonomous cities—backed by urban guilds and the merchant class they represented.\nThe fundamental order in Plato's Republic consists of the ruling class, military class, and productive class. In Italy, the ruling and military classes were closely intertwined, thus the three classes were: the ruling class—the King of Lombardy and his military faction; the Church; and the "Sages" supported by merchant guilds. These social elites, seen by Plato as most fit to govern—philosophers—formed the Council of Sages, funded by guilds, serving as the voice of the productive guilds. Those leading the state should not merely be rulers but also part of the philosopher class. This did not mean guild-backed philosopher factions had seized the Lombard throne at the outset; rather, it was the Visconti's adaptation to court the capitalist commercial cities distinct from Greek city-states. Through unified guilds, capitalist-embryo commercial cities in Lombardy wielded higher authority than Imperial Free Cities in Germany. They were not just autonomous entities but could influence the political structure of the kingdom above them. The King of Lombardy, the guilds, and the philosophers formed a tripartite relationship."

Within Liao's borders, the ethnic composition is complex and beliefs diverse: Han Chinese who migrated from within the passes or crossed the sea; semi-agricultural, semi-hunting Jurchen tribes not fully submissive; sizable Korean communities entrenched in Dongning Prefecture; while the ruling Mongol aristocracy is but a drop in the ocean, forced to carefully coordinate and balance relations among all parties. The current King of Liao is the uncle of the reigning Yuan Emperor, sharing the same father as the previous emperor. He was the most legitimate heir to the throne but, being too young at his father's demise, was usurped by his half-brother. Though his brother promised him hereditary rule over Liao, it could not dispel the king's desolation and resentment. In Liao, he trusts the Han Chinese as his aides; with no heirs of his own, he has even adopted a Han foster son. The Yuan court's meticulously maintained realm for a century is on the brink of collapse. How can the Liao territory, beneath this toppling nest, remain secure? Should it strive to uphold Yuan rule, replace it to fulfill the King of Liao's long-held ambition, or join the vigorous Han anti-Yuan movement in the south to renew the Mandate of Heaven? Should it brave the northern snows to expand frontiers, or allow the Jurchens to once again establish a new dynasty between the white mountains and black waters?

Thus, the Capetians zealously spread their branches across the realm, establishing cadet lines in regions to prevent another magnate from snatching the crown. True, relations between the main line and cadet branches soured as blood ties thinned. Cadets held real local power, while the French king was confined to the small Île-de-France. Yet, due to checks among princes and the main line's uninterrupted succession, no vassal attempted to seize the supreme throne—though shared paternal ancestry granted them a natural claim. The French king urgently needed a loyal force to counter increasingly autonomous kinsmen.\n\nIn 942 AD, due to prolonged border conflicts and personal feuds, the §YKing of Lotharingia§! incited the Duke of Burgundy against the French king but ultimately failed. Lotharingia not only lost Burgundy as an ally but also ceded the §YFlanders§! region to the French king.\n\nWith new vassals' support, the king reversed his fortunes, gradually expanding his demesne. In the 12th and 13th centuries, §Yroyal princes§! faced pressure from both knightly vassals and the crown. Royal appanages faced heavier taxes and levies, while knightly fiefs enjoyed greater diplomatic freedom yet closer royal scrutiny. But nothing remains unchanging. The first knights ennobled by the king naturally felt gratitude; their sons remembered the favor. Yet as knights sank roots into their lands, they drifted from the king like the royal princes before them. Southern France, especially, slipped from royal control due to the Cathar movement. Knightly vassals centered on Flanders and Burgundy formed the §YCommonweal Alliance§!, seeking greater autonomy or even independence from the French crown. Royal princes turned to the king, hoping for favor as kinsmen. Their conflict peaked in the famous §Y"Berry Dispute."§! In 1425, the Duke of Berry, a royal prince, died without heirs. §YRoyal princes§! wanted Prince Louis to inherit the duchy, while §Yknightly vassals§! argued for Robert de Bourgogne, the duke's nephew. Tensions escalated toward armed conflict, with local townsfolk actively engaged. Ultimately, royal mediation disarmed all parties: Robert inherited the duke's personal wealth, while the towns of Berry gained §Yautonomous rights§!—they could elect their own magistrates, subject to royal appointment.\n\nThe king's §Ycentralizing tendencies§! naturally bred vassal discontent and rebellion. In 1428, resentful of royal sidelining and incited by the §YKing of England§! and §YKing of Lotharingia§!, the §YDuke of Alençon§! defected to England. §YKing Hugues VI§! marched to seize Alençon and reclaim Normandy but faced internal and external obstacles. Lords covertly resisted the king's military ambitions, fearing they might be next. With armies delayed, the king's forces were halted outside Caen, and Alençon slipped from Paris's grasp. More critically, §YHugues VI§! was wounded by a stray arrow during the Siege of Caen. §YKing Louis VII of Lotharingia§! seized the moment to invade France, defeating and capturing §YHugues VI§! at Caen. Since Louis VII's mother was a Capetian, he forced Hugues VI to sign the §Y"Treaty of Caen,"§! demanding Hugues VI disinherit the French §YDauphin Hugues VII§! and name Louis VII heir to the French throne. Hugues VI soon died of infection, and Louis VII claimed the §YFrench crown§!, intending to be crowned at Reims. Meanwhile, §YEnglish§! forces landed in Normandy, and §YArles§! invaded from the south.

In retaliation, the English bribed the Papacy to condemn Joan as a §Mheretic§!.

Following Władysław III's death, they exploited the power vacuum to overthrow local magnates, seized control of Lesser Poland, and established a Hussite noble republic, with its highest authority named the "Purification Council."\n\nSiemomysł III, Duke of Greater Poland, had long-standing ties with Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. He understood that Polish kings over the past century had sought to centralize power, while autonomy within the Empire's principalities grew. Thus, he aspired to become a West Slavic imperial prince like Bohemia, thereby escaping the Teutonic Order's threat and facilitating his influence into Pomerania. Consequently, Siemomysł III refused submission to the distant court in Kraków, effectively achieving independence.\n\nThe north-south split in Poland encouraged the Duchy of Masovia to also lean toward independence. As a result, the central court in Kraków lost control over most of the realm, and the title of King of Poland became largely nominal. While the throne in Kraków remained vacant, the ruler of Greater Poland had no desire to become Duke of Kraków. The state based in Sandomierz was a republic. It seemed only the Piast ruler of Masovia could ascend as the new "King of Poland."


EDG_string_start_ARL:0 "§YShiism and the Safavid Dynasty§!\nThe Iranian Plateau, one of the cradles of ancient civilization, has long endured foreign rule or fragmentation since the fall of the Sassanian Empire. From the 15th to early 16th century, western Iran witnessed rivalry between the Black Sheep and White Sheep Turkomans, while central and eastern Iran were embroiled in conflicts among Timurid descendants. Uzbeks from Central Asia also began expanding, eyeing Khorasan. Yet, emerging from this chaos was a Sufi order from the Azerbaijan region—the Safavid Order. Under the leadership of Sheikh Ismail, they eventually unified Iran, profoundly shaping its modern history.\n\nIn eastern Azerbaijan, on a plateau 1,351 meters above sea level, lies the small city of Ardabil. In the 10th century, it briefly served as Azerbaijan's center but was soon overshadowed by Tabriz over 200 kilometers away. Tabriz quickly became a key transit hub and commercial post connecting East and West, thriving thereafter. In contrast, Ardabil remained obscure, especially after being sacked by Mongol armies in 1220, further declining. However, its relatively remote location made it fertile ground for religious movements. Surrounded by mountains, deep forests, and the Gilan marshes, it offered refuge for religious figures from rulers' scrutiny and persecution. The Safavid Order grew in such an environment.\n\nThe order's founder, Safi al-Din, died in 1334. With his eldest son predeceased, he designated his second son, Sadr al-Din, as successor. Sadr continued Safi's policies, constructing extensive religious facilities in Ardabil, including a mausoleum for his father, successfully transforming Ardabil into a holy site for the order, attracting pilgrims. The order's influence expanded significantly, drawing many Turkoman tribes active in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria into its fold.\n\nSadr al-Din died in February 1391. Like his father, he was interred in Ardabil's sanctuary. Leadership passed to his son, Khwaja Ali. Under Khwaja's tenure, the order began shifting, incorporating some Shiite doctrines. The reasons remain unclear, possibly to solidify the family's "legitimacy" within the order—Shiism values lineage. Khwaja also maintained good relations with Timur, then ruler of Iran, who granted the Safavid Order tax-collection rights locally and entrusted Khwaja with Turkoman prisoners of war from Rum (Anatolia). Khwaja freed them, settling them at the Ganja sanctuary; these prisoners pledged loyalty, their descendants later forming the Rumlu tribe among the Qizilbash.\n\nKhwaja ultimately rested in Jerusalem. After burying his father, Ibrahim returned to Ardabil, leading the order until his death in 1447. Records from this period are scarce, but it is clear that Ibrahim strengthened the order's organization, building a tight network of followers. Agents known as khalifas managed followers in various regions, acting as deputies directly answerable to the Sheikh; their commands equated to the Sheikh's. Pilgrimage to Ardabil's sanctuary became institutionalized, an obligation. During pilgrimages, masses gathered in Ardabil, receiving Ibrahim's teachings for spiritual fulfillment. Moreover, Ibrahim's charitable efforts far exceeded his ancestors', amassing resources to aid the poor.\n\nWhen Ibrahim's son, Junayd, succeeded, the Safavid Order reached a critical turning point. Doctrinally, it blended Shiite extremism and indigenous shamanistic beliefs with Sufi mysticism. Leaders proclaimed themselves incarnations of the Hidden Imam, the awaited Mahdi, inciting followers to join "holy war" and prepare for final judgment. Furthermore, Junayd no longer settled for spiritual allegiance but pursued temporal sovereignty.\n\n—Esmail Lahestani


EDG_string_start_PIT:0 "§YThe Republic of Piedmont§!\nIn the eyes of the Romans, Piedmont was a den of pagans and rebels hidden in the mountains. To Duke Filippo of Milan, Piedmont was an insignificant failure. For Count Ludovico of Saluzzo, the Republic of Piedmont was a threat at his flank. Yet to the King of Arles, Piedmont was one of their few fellow believers, a banner of the Cathar faith within the Catholic heartland of Italy. Following the failures of the two Albigensian Crusades, Catharism spread like wildfire across Occitania, unstoppable. Occitan-speaking peasants smashed Catholic monasteries and churches, draping the robes of oppressive Catholic clergy upon themselves. Sacraments, the Eucharist, and icons lost their importance in Occitania. When the Cathar call echoed through Lombardy, the oppressed—whether speaking Occitan, French, or Lombard dialects—rose in rebellion, driving the main line of the House of Savoy from their ancestral lands, leaving their cadet branch confined to small Genoa. At the Cathar heart—the court of the Kingdom of Arles—Savoy and Piedmont were often broadly termed "sister republics." Yet beyond sisterly ties, they differed greatly. Separated by the Alps, compared to the Republic of Savoy, which could hardly act without Arles' oversight, the Republic of Piedmont truly held its own destiny. Both Savoy and Piedmont claimed Turin as their indisputable capital. Savoy attempted to use the ducal claim of their former rulers as a tool for expansion. The dispute over Turin persisted, yet under the encirclement of Catholic powers, the two republics refrained from open conflict to defend the broader Cathar cause. The first task for any new Consul was to resolve this historical issue. For Piedmont, the Duchy of Lombardy, straddling the Po Valley's richest lands, was not only a pillar of Catholicism in northern Italy but also a staunch imperial ally. Piedmont, nestled at the Alps' foot, could not match Lombardy's wealth. Milan embodied all of Lombardy's glory and riches, and the threat from Lombardy kept Turin's Consul awake at night. Of course, if Milan were plunged into internal strife, it would not only eliminate the eastern threat but also present Piedmont with a golden opportunity to shift the balance of power in northern Italy."
