EDG_flavorVEN.1.desc:0 "Since the ascension of Francesco Steno Dandolo, the Venetian monarchy has been on a continuous decline, suffering repeated defeats in both diplomatic negotiations and military conflicts, resulting in the loss of significant territories. However, what worries the House of Dandolo even more is that Francesco is not only politically incompetent but also suffers from a certain impotence—he has left no male heirs.\n\nShould Francesco die, the main line of the House of Dandolo will face extinction. All the efforts the Dandolo family has made to control Venice since 1204 will be in vain—an outcome the House of Dandolo will never accept. Simultaneously, if the main line dies out, anti-monarchists will surely seize this rare opportunity to oppose the Dandolo family's monarchical transformation of Venice, plunging our beloved city into severe division and crisis."

EDG_flavorVEN.2.desc:0 "Since the ascension of the current monarch, Francesco Steno Dandolo, the Venetian monarchy has been on a continuous decline. Francesco Dandolo, the current head of the House of Dandolo and the nominal ruler of the Venetians, would never have become the Doge of Venice if not for the arrival of the Red Death. However, the tide of plague swept across the world, making the orderly succession to the Doge's throne an almost hopeless task—who knew who was alive and who was dead? In the end, Francesco became the Doge of Venice. The past decade has been fraught with disasters for Venice: its territory has shrunk, its overseas influence has waned, and even domestically, many anti-monarchist uprisings have erupted. Since the legendary figure, Duke Filippo of Lombardy, took power, Venice has suffered defeats in both diplomatic negotiations and military conflicts, losing direct control over the important cities of Bergamo and Brescia, and even losing control over Verona, a city in the heart of Venetian territory, in recent years. The merchants of Verona, allied with anti-monarchists and incited by Duke Filippo of Lombardy, declared independence and established the Republic of Verona, which has now become a de facto vassal of Lombardy.\n\nUpon his accession, Francesco once harbored grand ambitions, eager to achieve great things. However, a series of military and diplomatic setbacks severely shattered his faith and will. He then immersed himself in elusive religious pursuits, traveling with mendicant friars. Other prominent families, long covetous of power, forced him to relinquish his authority. Thus, in 1443, Francesco had to announce his plan to spend the rest of his life in a monastic order, and the incompetent doge yielded his power to others.\n\nContemporary Venetian scholars commented on him thus: 'He abandoned the handling of state affairs, never leaving the company of mendicant friars, monks, and the righteous, content with a life of less is more. When told that this would not do—that the state needed a doge capable of managing affairs—he handed over power to other families, which satisfied him greatly. His wife, relatives, and close advisors had no choice but to agree.'"

If we propose a marriage alliance, we are confident the Byzantine Empire will not refuse.\n\nAs for who will become the dominant ruler of these two nations after this wedding of the century, any discerning observer need only compare the state power of the Venetian Monarchy with that of the Byzantine 'Empire' to see the answer."

From the mid-7th century onwards, Arabs repeatedly attacked the island, occupying some of its regions. From 965 to 1191, Byzantium reasserted absolute control over Cyprus. During 1184–1191, the Byzantine governor of Cyprus, Isaac Komnenos, declared independence from Byzantium. In 1191, during the Third Crusade, King Richard I of England captured the island. It was later transferred by the Knights Templar to the French King of Jerusalem. This eventually developed into the feudal Kingdom of Cyprus, an independent state until our Venetian annexation. Historically, it would also be annexed by the Republic of Venice in 1489, becoming a crucial transit point and port on Venice's Eastern Mediterranean trade routes."

His purpose was to establish a Greek center near Naucratis in Egypt, serving as a link between Greece and the fertile Nile Valley. At that time, only one location in Egypt offered the conditions for such a city: Alexandria, situated behind the island of Pharos and unimpeded by the silt of the Nile Delta.\n\nFrom its very founding by Alexander the Great, Alexandria became a primary hub for the Eastern spice trade and a meeting place for merchants from Europe, Asia, and Africa. For centuries, Alexandria remained one of the most important centers of the spice trade.\n\nDuring the Roman era, it was one of the five major Patriarchal sees, a renowned Roman stronghold, and the center of trade between Europe, Arabia, and India, second only to Rome itself in size. Under Roman rule, Alexandria was even nominally a free Greek city with its own senate.\n\nHowever, after the division of the Roman Empire, Byzantine control over Alexandria gradually weakened. In 640, the Arab general Amr ibn al-As captured Alexandria after a fourteen-month siege, during which the city received no aid from Constantinople. Alexandria thus fell into the hands of Arab and Muslim rulers.\n\nNow, our great Venice has finally reclaimed this ancient city in the name of Christendom once more.

Silk transported from the distant Orient converged here before being shipped to various European nations.\n\nSince the 3rd century BC, Aleppo has been a thriving city with a unique strategic role. This has preserved its distinctive status from the times of the Akkadian and Amorite dynasties to the present day. Aleppo is also the convergence point of several important northern trade routes, connecting Southern Europe, the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. Throughout the eras of Ancient Greece and Rome, it served as a vital strategic point and transportation hub. In the 18th century BC, the Amorites even made Aleppo their imperial capital. Aleppo also holds significant importance in Christianity, having been a bishopric with a grand cathedral that stands preserved to this day.\n\nAround 1595 BC, the Hittites seized Aleppo from the Anatolians during their invasion of the Babylonian Kingdom. In 738 BC, the Assyrians occupied the city. After the death of Alexander the Great, Aleppo fell under the Seleucid Empire and was later governed by Rome in 65 BC.\n\nIn 636 AD, Aleppo was conquered by the Arabs and entered a period of prosperity under Umayyad rule.

The gold obtained from the guilds then flowed lavishly into the coffers of mercenaries. Duke Filippo relied on the guilds to extract wealth from Italy, and naturally, the guilds demanded power in return. Among the scholars at the academy founded by the Duke, a group advocated learning from ancient Greek arts and culture, proposing the establishment of a top-down 'ideal state' ruled by philosophers. Their views gained significant traction in Lombardy. Philosophers, of course, could not covet the Visconti throne, but the Duke himself did not mind presenting himself as a philosopher.\n\nIn 1440, Lombardy convened its first 'Council of the Wise,' presided over by the Duke himself. Participants included scholars from the Milan Academy and esteemed dignitaries from various autonomous cities, representing the guilds and the merchant class behind them.\n\nThis administrative system functioned well enough while Duke Filippo was alive, but after his death, it finally spun out of control. He left no adult heir. The Council of the Wise, eager to realize the basic order of Plato's Republic, attempted to transform Lombardy into a full republic. The ambitious mercenary captain, Sforza, saw this precious opportunity and now eyes the Ducal throne of Lombardy, attempting to use the Council's influence to seat himself upon it. The young Duke of Lombardy, isolated and helpless, may choose a desperate gamble, inviting foreign forces to intervene in Lombardy's internal affairs.\n\nBoth Sforza and the young Visconti heir are in desperate need of a powerful backer and supporter.

In contrast, the smaller Council of Ten is far more agile. Established as early as Venice's republican era, its original function was to protect the Republic from various conspiracies. However, the flexibility inherent in its small size has allowed it to usurp increasing powers. During the Dandolo family's monarchical transformation of Venice, the Council of Ten, gauging the winds, sided with the monarchists to jointly suppress the republicans, earning the Dandolo family's growing trust. Due to Francesco Steno Dandolo's incompetence and excessive delegation of authority, the power of the Council of Ten has further swelled. By enhancing its own authority, the Council of Ten has diminished the influence of the more representative Great Council. The annual selection of new members for the Council is often monopolized by small cliques formed from ancient noble family factions. Today, the Dandolo family deeply feels that the Council of Ten has slipped from their control and gradually seized significant power. Voices have emerged proposing reforms aimed at curtailing the Council of Ten's power, forcing them to return to their original functions, to ensure the absolute rule of the Dandolo family."

The number of impoverished nobles is also increasing daily. A large number of bankrupt nobles spend their stipends in the gambling dens inside and around the Campo San Barnaba. Some nobles are even willing to sell their votes to anyone who can afford the price. This group of nobles is sometimes named after the location, called the Barnabotti.

Vast amounts of Byzantine wealth flowed into Venice, leading to Byzantine animosity towards Venice. Relations between the two deteriorated sharply, reaching their nadir during the reign of the great Doge, Enrico Dandolo.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade was a turning point in Venetian-Byzantine relations. At Venice's most difficult moment, under severe Byzantine pressure, Enrico Dandolo achieved the most improbable victory. From then on, the tables turned. Byzantium continued to decline, while Venice strode forward on a broad and smooth path.\n\nToday, Byzantium is an empire in name only, its authority scarcely extending beyond the city walls of Constantinople.
