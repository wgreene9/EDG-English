EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_1_title:0 "Allies"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_1_desc:0 "We find ourselves in a perilous strategic position. The Beys of Edirne, the remnants in Greece, and the greedy Latin merchants all eye the Empire, which is recovering from the Bulgarian War, with covetous intent. We must seek allies in both the East and the West simultaneously, persuading them to aid our resurgence in order to balance the power dynamics in the Balkans."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_3_title:0 "A Western Power"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_3_desc:0 "Our powerful realm now stretches across Southeastern Europe, its might unparalleled, and the Empire has been restored. We should adjust our previous foreign policy to a more advantageous direction, establishing our preeminent status among allies, cultivating loyal servants among vassals, and reaffirming our true position. Let all, both within and beyond our borders, acknowledge us as a rising Western power."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_4_title:0 "Flame Dancing on Powder Keg" # White Flame Dancing on the Powder Keg
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_4_desc:0 "The Balkan Peninsula is known as the powder keg of Europe, where conflicts of ethnicity, state, and religion are intricately interwoven. Yet now, with Serbia establishing a second empire dominating the Danube, this once volatile land has become a peaceful and tranquil haven under our rule. Slavs, Greeks, and Latins each find their place under imperial governance, and this land shall remain eternally stable under our order. Our adept diplomacy has earned us the epithet, 'the White Flame dancing on the powder keg.'"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_6_title:0 "Demand Belgrade"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_6_desc:0 "Stefan 'the Tall' once acquired Belgrade through a diplomatic exchange. However, during the chaos following his assassination, the White City was once again seized by Hungary. Now that we have regained our prominence in Eastern Europe, and the Magyars are still licking the wounds from the Crusade of Varna, with Regent Hunyadi attempting to rule his kingdom independently from the Holy Roman Empire, it seems possible to obtain Belgrade from Hungary through negotiation, much like in the early 15th century."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_7_title:0 "The Pure White City"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_7_desc:0 "Belgrade, situated at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers, is one of the most strategically significant locations in the entire Balkan Peninsula. Leaving such an important place undefended would be utter folly. Establishing fortifications here will render its geographic position nearly impregnable. We must reinforce Belgrade, making it our second capital, so that it may be celebrated through the ages under the name of the Pure White City."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_10_title:0 "Battle with the Habsburgs" # Decisive Battle with the Habsburgs
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_10_desc:0 "The Swabian House of Habsburg has woven a vast network of power through generations of strategic marriages, seizing substantial interests in Central Europe. They have not only persistently obstructed our grand strategy in Europa but also endlessly prattled about their tenuous, ethereal claim to the Roman legacy. However, this ends here! Our glorious army now stands before the Habsburg seat of power—Vienna, the gateway to Central Europe. We shall utterly destroy this pretender dynasty coveting the crown of Justinian and shatter the Germanic hegemony!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_11_title:0 "The Hammer of North Italy" # The Hammer of Northern Italy
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_11_desc:0 "The lands where Belisarius once campaigned are now torn apart by conflicts between monarchists and republicans, with endless wars. Although the pretender empire's influence has waned, these obtuse elites fail to realize that the fertile Po Valley and prosperous Latin towns are now exposed to the Empire's gaze. The power vacuum left by the Germans shall be filled by us. We have already staked our claim to the Iron Crown. The legacy of the Western Empire must be reclaimed. Awaiting us is a more peaceful Mediterranean, a more Serbian Mediterranean."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_13_title:0 "Invasion of the West"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_13_desc:0 "The rich ancestral lands of the Western Empire remain embroiled in strife. The Kingdom of the Fleur-de-lis covets the Western legacy; Britain languishes under a weak king controlled by parliament; and the flames of conflict still blaze fiercely in Iberia. Each clings to its delusions of grandeur, harboring ambitions beyond their strength. After a brief respite, let us assemble the western expeditionary force, crush their fantasies, and complete the great task left unfinished by Justinian."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_14_title:0 "Caesar of East and West"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_14_desc:0 "Since the division of the Roman Empire, the rift between East and West has deepened. But now, as we—the true heirs to the crown of the Eastern Empire—have reclaimed the vast majority of the Western Empire's territories, ruling once more over a unified realm, the Roman Empire is reborn from the ashes. The rise of a new Imperator casts the glory of old once again across Europa, stirring storms along the Rhine and Danube. There cannot be two suns in the sky. We are unquestionably the greatest Caesar of both East and West."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_16_title:0 "Serbian Hussars"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_16_desc:0 "Cavalry will be crucial if we are to continue our expansion. The Serbian Hussars possess an excellent combat tradition; their shock assault and flanking capabilities are vital to our success, both offensive and defensive. Let us increase their numbers and enhance their training, sustaining the armies of the Serbian Empire for the struggles yet to come."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_17_title:0 "Dragoon Regiment"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_17_desc:0 "As our great nation continues to grow, our military expands both in quality and quantity. However, in the process of expanding across the entire Balkans, there are other pressing matters to attend to. If we forge closer alliances with the feudal nobility, we will be able to utilize the renowned Dragoon Regiment. This noble order of knights excels in enhancing military quality and aiding foreign expansion, assisting us in confronting the enemies of the Christian faith."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_18_title:0 "Timar of the Serbian Empire"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_18_desc:0 "The Timar system is a unique land tenure institution of the Serbian Empire. The Empire grants land to the high nobility for governance, and in return, they are required to train large numbers of elite cavalry for imperial campaigns. Now, with the Empire unprecedentedly powerful, the Timar system has reached its zenith, and the fame of Serbian knights resounds throughout Europe."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_21_title:0 "The New Vidin Code"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_1_21_desc:0 "As our military expands further, we require a more comprehensive conscription code to address manpower issues and confront new adversaries. We should promulgate the new Vidin Code to broaden conscription, establishing a massive standing army that will strike awe into all who dare stand before the Empire."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_2_title:0 "Revenge on Herzegovina"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_2_desc:0 "During the chaotic period following the assassination of the great Emperor Stefan 'the Tall', the heretical subjects of Herzegovina clashed with us repeatedly and ultimately broke free from our control, bringing shame upon the Empire. Now, as we rise reborn from the ashes, it is time for revenge. We shall exact a bloody toll on Herzegovina and make the traitors pay."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_3_title:0 "Danubian Empire"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_3_desc:0 "When you gaze upon the gentle clear waters of the Danube, do you not feel that tenderness in your heart? When you hear the songs of Serbs and the sound of horns echoing through the streets of the White City, does it not bring you joy? When you see the peasants toiling diligently in the fields of Slavonia, does it not fill you with pride? We have established a glorious Danubian Empire, and our people shall henceforth live and work here in peace and contentment."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_4_title:0 "The Legacy of Bura Pimir" # The Legacy of Duke Bura Pimir
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_4_desc:0 "Duke Bura Pimir of Croatia once founded an independent state stretching from the mountains in the north to the sea in the west and reaching the great river in the east. Yet now, its people have fallen under Hungarian control. Let us sweep away the dust of the Latin Church, liberate our Croatian brethren, and advance towards the goal of unifying the South Slavic Empire."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_5_title:0 "Unification of the South Slavs"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_5_desc:0 "For too long, the South Slavs have been subjects of foreign powers, subjugated under alien rule, unable to master their own destiny. Fortunately, like a new dawn breaking over the Balkan Peninsula, we have achieved the unification of the South Slavs. Conflicts of faith and cultural divides once tore us apart, but today, we shall all unite under the Slavic-Hellenic banner, shatter our chains, forge a new destiny, and ensure that future centuries remember us, forevermore!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_7_title:0 "The Crown of Saint Stephen"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_7_desc:0 "The Magyars have long vacillated between Eastern and Western Europe, attempting to construct their fragile national identity. After the disastrous defeat at Varna, they embarked on a long decline, even falling into the hands of the Habsburgs. Let us shatter the ambitions of the House of Habsburg, liberate the Kingdom of Hungary from their grasp, and personally crown ourselves with the Crown of Saint Stephen. We shall grant the Magyars freedom, rekindle the loyalty they once held centuries ago for the rulers of Constantinople, and make them our most faithful auxiliaries."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_8_title:0 "Carpathian Threat" # End the Carpathian Threat
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_8_desc:0 "The nobles of Carpathia rule vast lands on the fringes of the pretender empire and Polish influence. For centuries, the nomadic tribes and horse-lords entrenched here have brought us countless troubles. Now, as we have firmly secured the expansive lands beneath the Carpathians, Carpathia can no longer pose a threat to the Empire in the north. Instead, it shall become the Empire's most loyal frontier bulwark."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_10_title:0 "Advance on Naples"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_10_desc:0 "The lands of southern Italy are separated from the Balkans only by a narrow sea. The Norman princes of the peninsula and the republicans of Sicily share intricate ties with the Eastern Empire. If we can land in southern Italy, we can claim these fertile lands as our own, integrate the old subjects into our administrative system, and lead the local, long-lost people to once again sing the songs of Magna Graecia."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_11_title:0 "Threatening Rome"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_11_desc:0 ""The Eternal City," "The Capital of the World," "The City of God"... Rome, this great metropolis, boasts countless illustrious names. This beating heart of Italy now lies exposed before our iron cavalry. Here lies the seat of the Roman Pontiff, the very core of the Latin Church. We shall not halt at Magna Graecia. As heirs of Justinian, the crown of Italia shall be ours for the taking. Let us chastise the Roman Pontiff, dismantle the Catholic See, and restore the land where the Empire first began."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_12_title:0 "Emperor of Latium"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_12_desc:0 "Before our arrival, Italy was a mess composed of backward, incompetent nobles, incessant zealots, and greedy, tyrannical usurpers. After our coming, order reigns across the Apennine Peninsula; the chaos has been shattered by us. Latins, Greeks, and Slavs now live and work here in peace. Anyone can see that we are the true Emperor of Latium, the successor to Belisarius, and the inheritor of Justinian's legacy."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_14_title:0 "The End of the Latin Church"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_14_desc:0 "A minor dispute long ago divided the Kingdom of Heaven into two—the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Western Catholic Church, or what is known as the Great Schism. But as all of Italia now basks in the radiance of the Serbian Emperor, the Eastern Orthodox faith is gradually being restored. All heretical thoughts shall be purged by us, and the clownish church of the Roman Pontiff shall be disbanded, leaving the Western world leaderless."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_15_title:0 "Restore the Pentarchy"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_15_desc:0 "Justinian's system of the Pentarchy has been long profaned by the Latin Church of Western Europe. How can we achieve the unity described in Christian doctrine within a divided Church? With the Latin Church abolished, we must mediate among the key centers of the Justinian system and restore the modern Pentarchy. We shall no longer distinguish between Orthodox and Catholic believers; we have but one identity—followers of Jesus Christ."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_17_title:0 "The Duty of the Nobility"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_17_desc:0 "The Grand Župans enjoy extensive privileges under the Serbian imperial system and therefore bear significant responsibilities. We should also revise the administrative code, employing various means—both carrot and stick—to control the noble class, gradually strengthen central authority, and ensure the proper functioning of the administrative system."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_19_title:0 "Regency Agreement"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_19_desc:0 "The Regency Council is a product of compromise and cooperation between Serbian sovereign authority and the high nobility, an alliance for the nation's sake. Its duty is to assist the monarch in handling daily state administration and managing the vassal system, ensuring smooth governance even under incapable rulers. This will help maintain stable state operations, serving as a powerful arm for us, especially during periods of political turmoil or lacking leadership."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_21_title:0 "New Brdo Code"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_2_21_desc:0 "The 'Brdo Code', also known as the 'Mining Code', is our nation's compilation of laws concerning mining and labor management from the late medieval period. As our territory continuously expands and new resources are discovered for our use, we must constantly update the Mining Code to align with our current circumstances. The Balkans are rich in metal resources; we shall better utilize the earth's bounty to support our industrial development, establishing workshops on the land to extract these resources."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_1_title:0 "Surviving the Aftermath"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_1_desc:0 "The nightmare known as the Bulgarian War has finally been brought to a close by us. Regardless of the devastation the war inflicted upon this land, our nation is now stable once more, the army has been reorganized, and the government has been restructured and renewed. It can be foreseen that the Greater Serbian Empire will surely be restored, and the imperial banner will fly once again over the entire Balkans."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_2_title:0 "Destroy Bosnia"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_2_desc:0 "The land of Bosnia... has lost its way. Its people venerate ancient heresies, and its rulers refuse to convert to our faith. Without a doubt, we must destroy this petty kingdom. The white gold of this land needs to be developed, its people need guidance, and we—the elder brothers of the South Slavic peoples—shall become that guide. Let it become our directly administered territory."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_4_title:0 "Kristjani"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_4_desc:0 "As a transitional zone between Roman Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy, the Bosnian region has long harbored a unique faith bearing characteristics of both. As the legitimate leaders of the Eastern Church, we should not tolerate this heresy, which is intricately linked to Latin heterodoxy. We must completely abolish this local church and bring it directly under the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church. Let this be the starting point for the revival of the Orthodox Church."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_6_title:0 "The Legacy of Stefan"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_6_desc:0 ""His kingdom stretched from the eastern mountains to the western sea, / The last paradise where men roamed free. / His sword was keen, his spear was sharp, / His war-helm gleamed bright and bold, / His silver shield reflected / The boundless sky with stars untold. / Years ago he rode to war, / Where he is now, none can know." The era of the great Emperor Stefan Dušan has passed for over a century, and now we have reclaimed his ancestral lands; we are the restorers of the Serbian Empire!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_8_title:0 "Reclaim Ionia"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_8_desc:0 "For centuries following the westward incursions of the Seljuks, savage Turks flooded into Anatolia like a raging tide, and the Eastern Empire began its gradual disintegration from that point onward. The Greek city-states on the eastern shores of the Aegean have since spent year after year in precarious anticipation, gazing westward for the imperial army, on the brink of collapse. Now, the lands of Ionia and Nicaea have all been reclaimed by us, and the stability of the Aegean Sea is secured. Greece shall surely be led by Serbia to brush off the dust and restore its former brilliance."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_9_title:0 "Serbian Hegemony"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_9_desc:0 "With our control over vast territories in the Balkans and Anatolia, and even holding the Queen of Cities, Constantinople, it is time to re-examine our legitimate claim to the inheritance of Greece and the Roman Empire. Let us take up the mantle of the Purple Phoenix, fulfill her long-cherished wish, completely expel the Turks, and establish our own everlasting hegemony."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_10_title:0 "Reclaim Kastamonu"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_10_desc:0 "The importance of Anatolia to the Empire goes without saying. It was the loss of control over Anatolia that led to the gradual decline of the former Eastern Empire, resulting in the division of its legacy by the Turkish wolves. To restore the Roman Empire and secure our interests at the Bosporus, we must drive out the Turks and continue our great conquest. The first step is to restore the coastline of Kastamonu."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_12_title:0 "Restore Antioch"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_12_desc:0 "Antioch was once ranked alongside Constantinople, Rome, Jerusalem, and Alexandria as one of the Pentarchy, symbolizing the authority of the Eastern Church and ruling over the Christian world. Moreover, it was a crucial node on the Silk Road, a significant center of wealth in the East, and the gateway to the Holy Land. Without a doubt, whether for political significance, economic value, or military interest, we must restore it, bringing it back to the true faith. And from this starting point, we shall restore the Pentarchy."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_13_title:0 "Kingdom of Jerusalem"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_13_desc:0 "For centuries, the holy city of Jerusalem has languished under infidel rule. Although crusades organized by the Eastern Empire once briefly recaptured her, she was lost time and again. In the past, Rome, for various reasons, did not directly administer the Holy Land but left it to Frankish rule, whose weakness ultimately led to brutal destruction by the Saracens. Now, we—the Blessed Kingdom—should surpass previous dynasties, directly crown ourselves as the Supreme King of Jerusalem, shoulder the cause of reviving Orthodoxy, and ensure that Christian pilgrimages face no more perils."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_14_title:0 "Triumph in Egypt"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_14_desc:0 "Aegyptus! This once dazzling jewel of the Eastern imperial crown has long been tarnished in the hands of Saracens and Turks. After the sudden collapse of the Ayyubid dynasty, the land of Moses was torn apart by the Malik Wars and Mamluk civil strife, with vultures circling above, its former prosperity and abundance gone. If we can reclaim this former granary of the Empire and restore its governing order, it will not only become our model province, generating a continuous flow of wealth and power under our rule, but also deal a severe blow to the Islamic world."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_16_title:0 "Revise the Code"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_16_desc:0 "During the zenith of our old empire, the great Emperor Stefan compiled the Dušan's Code. This code was built upon venerable traditions, incorporating elements from Justinian's Code and laws implemented by our monarchs. Now, with the conclusion of the Bulgarian War, the Empire has entered a new era. To grow stronger amidst the winds of change sweeping across Europe, we should crown ourselves as the new Slavic Autocrat, review and amend this code to keep it relevant for our times."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_17_title:0 "Bastion of Christianity"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_17_desc:0 "The Greeks once strove to defend the faith in the Balkan region; now this responsibility falls upon our shoulders. With a strong Church and a powerful state, we are the natural leaders of the Orthodox faith. As heirs of Saint Sava, we are the natural bulwark of Christendom in the East. Now is the time to shoulder the duty of 'Protector' and become true guardians of the faith."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_18_title:0 "Ecclesiastical Act"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_18_desc:0 "The laws guiding our clergy are ancient, relying on old traditions that no longer hold meaning in the modern age. Clarifying the fundamental principles of our faith and providing guidance for our priests can bring our people and our Church closer together, better consolidating our imperial centralization policies and improving the administrative system."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_20_title:0 "Estates Monarchy"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_20_desc:0 "The Estates Monarchy is the political form that emerged in the Serbian Empire after completing numerous reforms and securing the perpetual loyalty of the three estates. Under this system, royal power is exercised through the Estates Assembly, with clergy, nobility, and citizens jointly participating in governance and sharing power to a certain extent. Royal authority is strengthened, the interests of all estates are realized, and an orderly political environment fosters further in-depth reforms in imperial administration."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_22_title:0 "Modern Government"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_3_22_desc:0 "The heretics of Western Europe once mocked the Serbian Empire as a medieval relic, a dying antiquity. But now, our government is strong and effective, our laws are just and impartial, and our people live and work in peace and contentment. No nation can surpass our achievements. A new era has arrived; Greater Serbia is marching toward her even greater future."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_2_title:0 "Tsargrad"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_2_desc:0 "Constantinople remains one of the most sacred and illustrious cities in Europe, yet its master—the once supremely powerful Eastern Empire—is now but a withered corpse wearied by internal strife, no longer worthy of holding this "Queen of Cities." We should rightfully bring it and its surrounding lands under our rule, making the jewel of the Greek world a permanent part of our Empire and the center of our dominion. This will both showcase our glory and bring light back to this land."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_3_title:0 "The Second Battle of Sofia"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_3_desc:0 "In 1402, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Sofia at the hands of the great Emperor Stefan 'the Tall,' was captured and imprisoned by us, leading to the fragmentation of the Ottoman Empire. His sons have since failed to reunite the legacy of the "Thunderbolt" amidst bloody strife. With the rise of the Rumelian Sultan Mehmed II, the old shackles seem to be loosening. Yet the infidels are doomed to perish. Let us rally our armies, consolidate our Balkan hegemony, and utterly destroy the wretched spawn of this pitiful house!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_4_title:0 "Return to Macedonia"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_4_desc:0 "Under the divine martial prowess of Stefan Dušan, Serbia once controlled vast southern lands, reaching the shores of the Aegean Sea, proud to be the common emperor of Greeks and Slavs. Our sovereignty over Greek lands is unquestionable. Now, as our strength grows daily, it is time to shoulder the responsibility of liberating Macedonia from foreign hands and, using it as a springboard, freeing the broader Greek people, restoring the glory of our forebears, and reclaiming the territories of Greece!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_5_title:0 "Breaching Thermopylae"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_5_desc:0 "In early 1444, Theodore of the Laskaris family, backed by Venetian and Sicilian support, raised his own army and betrayed the Emperor in Constantinople, arrogantly proclaiming himself Basileus. Yet his rule in the Peloponnese was precarious; treacherous Latins and watchful Turks could easily overturn Morea. As the rightful defenders of the Romans and all Orthodox believers, we should strike first, breach Thermopylae, and defeat the Venetian lackeys."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_7_title:0 "Masters of Dalmatia"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_7_desc:0 "For a long time, merchants from the so-called 'Most Serene Republic' and Ragusa, with their hired rabble, repeatedly ravaged the Balkan coasts, preventing any major Slavic power from controlling the Dalmatian coastal cities. However, the situation has now changed. Foolish Venetian usurpers are struggling to survive amidst internal strife, with no time to look eastward, while we seek to extend our influence over the fertile Adriatic Sea. Let us cleanse the legacy of the Italians and liberate Dalmatia."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_8_title:0 "The Latin Curtain Falls"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_8_desc:0 "Deceitful Latins sit upon their thrones of flesh and gold, savoring the spoils of conquest taken from the Orthodox world. But now, with the rise of the Serbian Empire, they can no longer rest easy and lord it over the faithful of the East with impunity. Imperial maritime trade will henceforth face no hindrance with the Latins utterly expelled; the Aegean and Adriatic Seas are once again in the hands of the Eastern world."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_10_title:0 "Destroy Karaman"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_10_desc:0 "After we destroyed the spawn of the Ottomans, the Karamanids became our new eyesore. They falsely claim descent from the Rûm Sultan, inciting Turkish remnants to rebel, attacking our borders, and destabilizing our society. It is time for us to completely destroy the Karamanid Bey, relocate the Karamanid people, and subject them to forced labor as atonement."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_11_title:0 "Expel the Turks"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_11_desc:0 "The Eastern Empire's disastrous defeat at Manzikert sealed the fate of Anatolia. After that battle, the Turks began to settle here permanently. Turkish rule is like a wildfire, soon to be extinguished by us. As heirs to the Eastern Empire, after driving them from Greece and western Asia Minor, we should go further and expel them completely from Anatolia."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_12_title:0 "Swords Pointed at Iraq"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_12_desc:0 "The region of Iraq was once inhabited by Turkic tribes adhering to Nestorianism, calling themselves 'Assyrians.' But these offspring of the Oghuz ultimately degenerated, falling prey to infidel delusions once more, awaiting our destruction. The Mesopotamian region now lacks a strong protector, like a choice lamb. Let us settle accounts with these 'Babylonians' before the Persians awaken and set our sights on the vast world beyond the Zagros Mountains!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_14_title:0 "Crusade in Fars"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_14_desc:0 "The region of Fars, as the cradle of the ancient Persian Empire, now sees Nestorianism taking root and sprouting peculiar branches here. Despite the deep rift between us in the past, in this foreign land, we are ultimately brethren in faith. Let us launch a grand crusade, strike directly at the heart of Persia, liberate our fellow believers of the Eastern Church, and utterly shatter Persian pride."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_15_title:0 "The Failure of Islam"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_15_desc:0 "Saracen mobs, claiming to be followers of the Prophet, once extended their power from the Kingdom of Santiago in the west to the descendants of Iranshahr in the east, committing countless atrocities on Eastern battlefields for millennia. Due to Christian division, we long failed to expel them and consequently suffered endless torment. Now, we finally have the chance to end this ancient nemesis, shatter the star and crescent, and declare their failure. 'Ye shall shed countless tears.'"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_17_title:0 "Sea Traders"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_17_desc:0 "Having just emerged from the Bulgarian War, we are at a critical juncture, with everything in need of reconstruction. The Mediterranean holds immense wealth to be tapped, and our merchants possess an excellent maritime trading tradition. Let us revise the administrative code, drive these 'sea traders' to master Eastern trade for us, and bring a continuous flow of wealth to the Empire."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_19_title:0 "Empower the Parliament"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_19_desc:0 "As we expand further, the pressure on our administrative system gradually increases. Times are changing, and we must constantly maintain our own progressiveness. We should summon our closest advisors, study Western European systems, invest in urban industries, establish a judicial system, integrate the power of vassals, and form a multi-estate parliament to adapt to the present and the future."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_21_title:0 "Resava Academy"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_4_21_desc:0 "Not all our wealth comes from minerals and trade, nor all our prestige from conquest and diplomacy. We must build Serbia into an intellectual power worthy of our achievements. To this end, we must establish the finest university in the entire Balkan region, even in all Christendom, attracting brilliant students and fostering intellectual innovation, spreading the brilliance of Greco-Slavic civilization."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_1_title:0 "Dominion over Bulgaria"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_1_desc:0 "During the Bulgarian War, Bulgarian nobles within Serbia acted duplicitously, secretly colluding with the False Tsar Constantine, causing significant trouble for the Empire. But with the pretender executed and their backers, the Shishman dynasty, thoroughly purged by us, we no longer need to show the meager mercy that Stefan 'the Tall' once extended to the Bulgarians. Instead, we shall correct past errors, completely eliminate disloyal Bulgarian nobles, and integrate the Bulgarian people directly into our administrative system."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_2_title:0 "Dissolve the League of Lezhë"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_2_desc:0 "In 1444, Albania's Skanderbeg united several lords at Lezhë to form a league, launching a great rebellion that ultimately swept across the entire Empire. Now, these unruly highlanders have been conquered by us once more. After executing the False Tsar to intimidate them, we have decided to repay hostility with virtue, letting bygones be bygones. We shall dissolve the League of Lezhë, allowing them to use their military prowess to serve us, fighting for us to the ends of the earth."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_4_desc:0 "After the catastrophe of 1204, the Despotate of Epirus was established as part of the remnants of the Eastern Empire. However, Latin Crusaders later seized control of it, further strengthening Latin cultural influence over the Greeks. For a long time, they used it as a base to tyrannize the Greek people, spread heresies, and endlessly threaten our rule from both sea and land. Now, we finally have the strength to chastise them once and for all."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_7_desc:0 "The greedy merchants of Venice have clashed with our nation countless times. Driven by profit, they have committed innumerable crimes, exhausting our patience. To avenge the Eastern Empire and to consolidate our maritime defenses and secure autonomous trade, we should completely expel the descendants of the Dandolos from the Aegean Sea, shatter their monopoly, and use force to rectify Venice's atrocities."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_10_desc:0 "After the collapse of the Sultanate of Rûm, Anatolia has long been in chaos, with Turkish beys, Kurdish highlanders, and Turkmen tribes ruling their own territories across the peninsula. But as Serbia's Levantine Crusade reaches the heartland of the former Sultanate of Rûm, they will all once again submit to Constantinople, honoring us as the supreme Caesar of Rûm."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_11_title:0 "Kingdom of Pontus"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_11_desc:0 "After the great sack of Constantinople in 1204, the Eastern Empire fragmented. The Komnenos family, claiming legitimacy, fled to the Pontus region. However, the usurping pseudo-king ultimately failed to protect the lands of Perateia. The rulers of Trebizond, complacent and indulgent in pleasure, were eventually conquered and destroyed by the sinister Afshars on the shores of the Black Sea. Now, let us take up the legacy of the Eastern Empire and rescue the Laz remnants of the Kingdom of Pontus from the Turks."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_12_title:0 "The Gate to the Caucasus"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_12_desc:0 "As the border zone between the spheres of influence of the Eastern Empire and the Iranian empires, the Caucasus has long been a region of constant strife. Even after both great empires declined, this area remained plagued by continuous disaster and unrest. The Kingdom of Georgia, our fellow believers, has slid into prolonged seclusion due to the weakening of central authority. As the shield of the Eastern Orthodox faith, let us help them end the calamity and even put an end to the strife in the Caucasus."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_13_title:0 "Conquer Tabriz"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_13_desc:0 "The ancient land of Iranshahr once gave birth to several vast empires. Each time they united, they posed a threat to the Mesopotamian and Caucasian hegemony of the Emperor in Constantinople. Now, among the lands of the Persian kings, a powerful force is gradually rising, potentially becoming our threat. Let us strike first, using Tabriz as a starting point, and resolve the eastern border troubles once and for all."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_14_title:0 "Blood Flows in Khorasan"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_14_desc:0 "Khorasan was once the heartland of the Persian Empire. Although Persia is no longer a significant threat to Christendom, we must not let our guard down. This region harbors the offspring of Turks, Mongols, and Turkmens, the last remnants of Zoroastrianism, and lost heretics. Let us wash Khorasan in blood, completely break the spine of Iran, and turn the once-arrogant Persian princes into our border watchdogs."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_16_title:0 "Royal Navy"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_16_desc:0 "The Adriatic and Aegean Seas are the lifelines of our Empire. If we wish to survive amidst the rivalries of kings in a land surrounded by powerful foes, we must establish a naval force commensurate with our nation's stature. The Serbian fleet must inspire awe among our friends and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_17_title:0 "Greek Tradition"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_17_desc:0 "Once, Greek civilization flourished immensely; they built invincible navies and dominated the classical age. Yet now, they have long languished under the impact of foreign races. As we restore the Aegean world and inject vitality into the Greek world, igniting a frenzy of naval competition, it is time to revive the Greek tradition, rebuild the Greek navy, and seize absolute maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_18_desc:0 "The vast Mediterranean holds immeasurable wealth. As our influence spreads across the former Roman world, we have established a massive trade network spanning Europa, Africa, and even Asia. We shall wed the Bride of the Mediterranean, formally declaring our maritime hegemony."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_21_title:0 "Preslav Literary School"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_formal_5_21_desc:0 "Over the past few centuries, the Preslav Literary School was the most important center of learning and culture for all Slavs, where the Slavic script was born. The school's golden age in the 10th century is long gone; the Bulgarians, obsessed with militarism, have left the once-great academy in ruins. As leaders of Greco-Slavic civilization, we must support and encourage the revival of literary schools, for modernity will not wait. We must embrace the world's new trends to avoid being left behind."
