EDG_HOL_flavor.1.t:0 "Amsterdam Manhole Covers Stolen"
EDG_HOL_flavor.1.d:0 "Recently, manhole covers have been frequently stolen within Amsterdam. Over one hundred covers have been lost in just a month, causing significant financial loss to the city government and creating serious safety hazards. These covers were an important measure implemented by the esteemed Stadtholder after learning about flooding during the rainy season. Each one is made of iron and is quite costly. The Stadtholder has now ordered all districts to strengthen security for these covers, striving to apprehend the culprits and put an end to these thefts in the shortest possible time."
EDG_HOL_flavor.1.aa:0 "Dammit, who did this?!"

EDG_HOL_flavor.2.t:0 "Defying Heaven's Leeks"
EDG_HOL_flavor.2.d:0 "Your Excellency, the esteemed Stadtholder, a group of people calling themselves 'value investors' have gathered at Amsterdam's Exchange Square. With devout eyes, they hold high banners proclaiming 'Time's Friend,' claiming to have comprehended the true essence of wealth. However, our government's financial advisors have discovered that the stock price of 'Eternal Royal Technology,' which they have heavily invested in, is plummeting off a cliff. Yet, their leader shouts 'Buy more as it falls!' as they charge toward the abyss... If we do not intervene, unforeseeable harm is likely to occur. Of course, if it crashes, it's their own affair—what does it have to do with us? So, the final decision rests with Your Excellency..."
EDG_HOL_flavor.2.aa:0 "Double down immediately; a rebound is certain!"
EDG_HOL_flavor.2.bb:0 "Looks like they need a taste of the Knights' clubs."
EDG_HOL_flavor.2.cc:0 "Ignore this matter."

EDG_HOL_flavor.3.t:0 "The Fall of the Stock God"
EDG_HOL_flavor.3.d:0 "Your Excellency, the esteemed Stadtholder, our nation's Chief Financial Advisor, who once accurately predicted three major bull markets and was revered as the 'Living God of Wealth,' has recently made repeated operational errors. He first heavily invested in 'Antarctic Whaling,' then leveraged wildly on 'Perpetual Motion Concept Stocks,' resulting in a total loss of capital. Now he kneels before you, tears and mucus streaming, explaining, 'This time it truly was 'market irrationality'! I assure you, this is definitely just a technical adjustment!' Gazing at his pitiful state, an idea emerges in Your Excellency's mind."
EDG_HOL_flavor.3.aa:0 "Throw him out for the enraged retail investors to vent their fury!"
EDG_HOL_flavor.3.bb:0 "Let it be, give him some money to stage a comeback."
EDG_HOL_flavor.3.cc:0 "Make him leave, but compile his experiences into a book."

EDG_HOL_flavor.4.t:0 "Mechanism Explanation"
EDG_HOL_flavor.4.d:0 "Historically, the Dutch Republic existed long-term within the complex and ever-changing environment of the Low Countries. Consequently, they frequently made appropriate industrial adjustments based on their needs and environmental changes. In the game, the author has specifically recreated this as a province button mechanism. We can sacrifice 1 point of two other types of development to gain 2 points of the desired development type. Do you accept?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.4.aa:0 "Yes, yes, of course."
EDG_HOL_flavor.4.bb:0 "Better not, let's forget it."

EDG_HOL_flavor.5.t:0 "The Historical Origins of Holland"
EDG_HOL_flavor.5.d:0 "Due to shifts in the worldline and timeline, after experiencing much chaos since the era of kingdoms, Holland's strength remains quite feeble at this point. Among the Low Countries, there are still powers like the Electorate of Overijssel, Lotharingia, and France. Today's Holland still has a long road ahead."
EDG_HOL_flavor.5.aa:0 "Let us see how far this nascent nation can go."
 
EDG_HOL_flavor.6.t:0 "Holland Seeks Our Aid"
EDG_HOL_flavor.6.d:0 "To resist Imperial influence, Holland has turned to embrace us. Shall we accept?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.6.aa:0 "Yes"

EDG_HOL_flavor.7.t:0 "Westerners Demand We Surrender Our Homeland"
EDG_HOL_flavor.7.d:0 "Recently, a group of people with golden hair, high-bridged noses, and pale skin have arrived. Wielding powerful guns and cannons, they seek to occupy our homeland. What shall we do?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.7.aa:0 "We are powerless."

EDG_HOL_flavor.8.t:0 "Hidden Dangers of the Market"
EDG_HOL_flavor.8.d:0 "As is well known, the market possesses three crucial and fatal flaws: spontaneity, blindness, and lag. These are difficult to perceive in the early stages, but the underlying drawbacks remain significant and cannot be ignored, necessitating timely adjustments through various policies."
EDG_HOL_flavor.8.aa:0 "Let's wait and see"

EDG_HOL_flavor.9.t:0 "The Revolt of the Netherlands"
EDG_HOL_flavor.9.d:0 "In the 14th century Netherlands, to sustain her extravagant courtly life and cover various military expenditures, the ruling Countess imposed increasingly heavy taxes upon the cities and countryside under her dominion. These levies were numerous, covering everything from land produce and commodity trade to daily necessities. The common folk—weavers, fishermen, petty traders, and farmers, already struggling to survive—were squeezed breathless. The fruits of their labor largely flowed into the Countess's treasury, exchanged only for worsening hardship. Simultaneously, the Countess's officials acted with arrogance, enforcing tax collection with ruthless indifference, deepening the people's resentment. As the limits of survival were continually breached, silent fury gathered and spread within the damp alleyways, beneath low eaves, and beside cold looms. Patience with injustice finally reached its breaking point, and the local populace swiftly rose in rebellion."
EDG_HOL_flavor.9.aa:0 "The fire spreads across the plains."

EDG_HOL_flavor.10.t:0 "The Welsh Red Dragon"
EDG_HOL_flavor.10.d:0 "The region of Wales has been a significant territory within the British Isles since ancient times. Now that we have conquered it, we can ride this momentum to advance further into the British Isles."
EDG_HOL_flavor.10.aa:0 "The Red Dragon is now subdued"

EDG_HOL_flavor.11.t:0 "The Dutch Extend an Offer of Vassalage"
EDG_HOL_flavor.11.d:0 "As our ties with Holland grow ever closer, both the upper echelons and common folk are blending together seamlessly. Perhaps now is the time to shed our identity as an independent nation and become part of Holland?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.11.aa:0 "Yes, yes, yes"
EDG_HOL_flavor.11.bb:0 "What are you thinking?!"

EDG_HOL_flavor.12.t:0 "Policy Towards France"
EDG_HOL_flavor.12.d:0 "Now that our wings are fully fledged, it is time to initiate a series of diplomatic actions towards this nation that once aided us. Should we continue our former friendship, or bare our fangs and strike them fiercely?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.12.aa:0 "We should maintain eternal goodwill."
EDG_HOL_flavor.12.bb:0 "We were never friends."

EDG_HOL_flavor.13.t:0 "The Dutch Offer to Purchase Flanders"
EDG_HOL_flavor.13.d:0 "The region of Flanders has long been a territory of the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire. Since we vassalized Flanders, uprisings large and small have emerged endlessly. Perhaps it is time we relinquished this troublesome land?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.13.aa:0 "Very well"
EDG_HOL_flavor.13.bb:0 "Absolutely impossible!"

EDG_HOL_flavor.14.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the Dutch"
EDG_HOL_flavor.14.d:0 "In recent years, Holland, as an emerging power, has made significant moves in the Low Countries. Their strength has grown sufficient to threaten our national independence. Should we perhaps compromise with them, or resist to the very end?"
EDG_HOL_flavor.14.aa:0 "We are powerless."
EDG_HOL_flavor.14.bb:0 "Never!"

EDG_HOL_tulip.1.t:0 "Judgment Day"
EDG_HOL_tulip.1.d:0 "In recent years, as our trade with the Ottomans has flourished, we discovered a miraculous and beautiful plant from their lands—the tulip. When it arrived in our great nation, the radiance of its splendor instantly soaked every inch of soil. Sailors in taverns no longer spoke of Eastern spices but whispered mysteriously of the 'Semper Augustus.' Government officials no longer debated how to ensure national stability; instead, they fervently clamored for the precious bulbs. In the Haarlem Exchange, the price of a single bulb had come to equal that of an armed merchant ship!\n\nThe baker in the canal district mortgaged his oven to buy 'futures,' while widows in The Hague pawned their late husbands' medals. Beneath our feet, our Republic, proud of its commercial rationality, is sliding into an abyss under a collective hypnosis...\n\nWhile we still slumber, the devil quietly awakens. As leverage climbs ever higher, sprinting toward its peak, trading volume plummets from that summit. Countless people, horrified by the era's sell-off, drop their weapons in a desperate attempt to escape the vortex they themselves created. Only when the evening bell signaling market closure tolls does everyone begin to ponder—for whom does the death knell ring?\n\nWhen the first bankrupt speculator leaps from the Exchange's bell tower, the plague begins. Amsterdam's canals are littered with shredded futures contracts, like fallen petals. In this calamity, the dead secretly rejoice at escaping fate, while the living still crumble under the disaster's weight. As a common investor painfully clutches a worthless scrap of stock, he squeezes his eyes shut to hold back his tears. In his dazed vision, he seems to see tulips in full bloom."
EDG_HOL_tulip.1.aa:0 "“Augustus laughs at them.”"

EDG_HOL_tulip.2.t:0 "The Windmills Turn Again"
EDG_HOL_tulip.2.d:0 "When the bronze bell of the Amsterdam Exchange rang for the last time for tulip prices, the heart of the entire Republic began to beat anew. Merchant ships floating on the canals once again set sail towards the vast and magnificent sea. We all secretly rejoiced that we were not, after all, powerless.\n\nAfter this disaster, a thought took root in every heart: 'When we no longer kneel before the absurd idol forged by money, when we cease to bow to the madly constructed castles in the air, when we stop gazing upward at the unknown world shaped by greed—only then can we proudly proclaim that we have conquered the monster we ourselves created.'\n\nOn an unremarkable Sunday afternoon, a former speculator walked with his young child along the port of Amsterdam. The blood-red, magnificent sunset cast golden light upon their faces. The child opened his mouth and smiled, saying, 'Father, the sun is setting.' The father also smiled and replied, 'It doesn't matter, for we all know the sun will rise again.'"
EDG_HOL_tulip.2.aa:0 "“Not everyone is rational forever, but there will always be those who are rational.”"

EDG_HOL_tulip.3.t:0 "Winter's Day"
EDG_HOL_tulip.3.d:0 "In the biting cold wind, no bids were raised at the Haarlem auction house. Panic spread like the plague; bulbs worth a fortune yesterday were as cheap as onions today. Enraged speculators stormed the town hall, burning futures ledgers. In the distance, discarded tulip bulbs floated on the canals, and the sleeping petals returned to nature once more."
EDG_HOL_tulip.3.aa:0 "Crush them with an iron fist!"
EDG_HOL_tulip.3.bb:0 "Perhaps we should just compensate them..."

EDG_HOL_tulip.4.t:0 "The Courtroom"
EDG_HOL_tulip.4.d:0 "Inside the Supreme Court of The Hague, the plaintiff, a farmer, clutched a bag of rotting 'Semper Augustus' bulbs and wept: 'Your Honor! Last year I traded all my land for this bag of 'gold'—now it's only fit for feeding pigs!' The defendant merchant flicked bulb fragments from his collar with contempt: 'The contract clearly states 'payment at market price upon delivery.' Now it is worth the same as onions.' A brawl erupted in the public gallery; someone hurled a concealed onion that struck the judge's wig. The court clerk trembled as he recorded: the 47th tulip litigation case this month, with a total value equivalent to three years of the nation's fiscal revenue."
EDG_HOL_tulip.4.aa:0 "Good heavens..."

EDG_HOL_tulip.5.t:0 "Warmth Beneath the Brick Wall"
EDG_HOL_tulip.5.d:0 "Months after the bubble burst, the nation still wallows in the mire of chaos, yet a faint semblance of calm begins to quietly spread. Street riots gradually subside; the hungry populace no longer relies solely on plunder to survive, as some spontaneous mutual aid groups start to emerge. In the old city of Amsterdam, several former bakery owners band together to distribute their remaining flour by headcount. Though each receives a pitifully small portion, it offers a glimmer of hope for survival."
EDG_HOL_tulip.5.aa:0 "Let us distribute the bread to the people"
EDG_HOL_tulip.5.bb:0 "There is nothing here to give them"

EDG_HOL_tulip.6.t:0 "Old Acquaintances at the Exchange"
EDG_HOL_tulip.6.d:0 "The Dutch economic order completely collapsed after the Tulip Mania bubble burst. Once-thriving commerce and trade ground to a halt; merchant ships lay idle in the ports in great numbers, and docks piled high with goods no one wanted. Amsterdam, the commercial heart of Holland, saw its former prosperity vanish. The once-bustling exchange stood cold and deserted; traders were laid off one after another, wandering the streets aimlessly."
EDG_HOL_tulip.6.aa:0 "We can't just kill the donkey after the grinding is done"
EDG_HOL_tulip.6.bb:0 "Just ignore it"

EDG_HOL_tulip.7.t:0 "The Flower Farmer"
EDG_HOL_tulip.7.d:0 "The Mette family has grown tulips for three generations on the outskirts of Haarlem. At the peak of the bubble, her husband traded three acres of fertile land for a single 'Viceroy' bulb, saying it would buy them a manor come spring. Now that bulb rots in the earth, and her husband, unable to bear the blow, hanged himself beneath the windmill. She clutches the debt ledger her husband left behind; the numbers coil around her like venomous snakes. The tax collector came again yesterday, saying if the outstanding taxes aren't paid, he'll seize what little land remains. Mette kneels in the field, using her frost-cracked fingers to dig through the frozen soil, unearthing those once-priceless bulbs one by one. They lie limp, caked in black mud, like pieces of rotting liver. Staring at the soil beneath her feet, Mette suddenly drops to her knees and weeps uncontrollably."
EDG_HOL_tulip.7.aa:0 "A heavy sigh"

EDG_HOL_tulip.8.t:0 "Cultural Reformation"
EDG_HOL_tulip.8.d:0 "Following the frenzy and collapse of the Tulip Mania, Dutch society embarked on a profound cultural reflection. Renowned painters in Amsterdam created a series of works focusing on the daily lives of ordinary people. Their paintings no longer depicted the blind pursuit of wealth, but instead showcased the tranquility and contentment found in mundane existence. These works resonated strongly across the Netherlands, becoming symbols of that era's cultural introspection."
EDG_HOL_tulip.8.aa:0 "Well done!"

EDG_HOL_tulip.9.t:0 "In the Rain"
EDG_HOL_tulip.9.d:0 "Over a decade later, in a downpour at the Haarlem cemetery, a history professor wipes an unmarked tombstone. The inscription is faded and illegible, with only the word "tulip" faintly discernible. A student holding an umbrella beside him complains, "Why did these fools risk their lives for flowers?" The professor replies slowly, "They weren't fools, my child. Many of them were as clever as you. But circumstances change, while the seeds of greed never do."
EDG_HOL_tulip.9.aa:0 "Capital never sleeps"

EDG_HOL_tulip.10.t:0 "Uproar"
EDG_HOL_tulip.10.d:0 "In the wake of this disaster, a large number of bankrupt and homeless people have gathered together. They now seek to overthrow the government by force to seize money and property or achieve other goals."
EDG_HOL_tulip.10.aa:0 "Lord, why is this happening?"

EDG_HOL_tulip.11.t:0 "Chaos"
EDG_HOL_tulip.11.d:0 "Amid unprecedented turmoil, both the financial and administrative branches of the government have grown infinitely pessimistic about the future and prospects. Consequently, their already low moral standards have plummeted even further, as they have begun engaging in widespread embezzlement and corruption."
EDG_HOL_tulip.11.aa:0 "Capital, you win."

EDG_HOL_tulip.12.t:0 "Mortal Realm"
EDG_HOL_tulip.12.d:0 "With the collapse of the government, many nobles who once indulged in luxury suddenly lost the source of their status. Infuriated, they have allied with various factions in parliament, preparing to launch a rebellion!"
EDG_HOL_tulip.12.aa:0 "To hell with them"

EDG_HOL_flavor.15.t:0 "The Dutch Story"
EDG_HOL_flavor.15.d:0 "Recorded history in the Low Countries dates back to a time before the Roman Empire was in its infancy. Even then, the Dutch were living on this fertile yet perilous land—land that, though rich, was extremely limited. This seems to have foreshadowed their later role as a chessboard for major powers. By the beginning of the 9th and 10th centuries, influenced by various forces, the Low Countries had fragmented into a patchwork of territories. Precisely because of this, the region was occupied by many small states, the most powerful among them being the Electorate of Overijssel and the County of Holland. However, the latter's rule gradually lost public favor starting in the 15th century. Despite its small territory, numerous entangled forces tore at the country, with the Republicans being particularly strong and ambitious. They sought to use their commercial capital to reshape not only the Low Countries but all of Western Europe, attempting to topple great powers with minimal leverage. By 1444, with the Count's health declining and the County of Holland's economic and political situation worsening, the Republicans appear poised to seize power, potentially bringing unprecedented upheaval to the entire region and Western Europe. Though we cannot predict the next steps, it is foreseeable that they will genuinely try to mend the world with money, until the end of days."
