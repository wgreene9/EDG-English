EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_1_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Orban was a metallurgy expert skilled in artillery manufacturing.\n\nInitially, he intended to serve the Byzantine Emperor, but the Emperor could neither afford his wages nor provide the necessary materials. Thus, he turned to the Sultan, claiming that the cannon he could build could not only destroy Byzantine walls but even the legendary walls of Babylon. Mehmed II was always interested in new advances in military science, eager to equip his army with the most advanced weaponry. He also enjoyed studying modern fortifications and siege engine construction techniques, summoning foreign weapons experts to his palace for consultations. Therefore, the Sultan immediately hired Orban with a generous reward and ordered him to forge a cannon powerful enough to blockade the Bosphorus at the Rumelihisari (the 'Throat-Cutter' Fortress) to test his capabilities. It took him three months to cast the cannon. One day, a Venetian ship carrying provisions attempted to pass through the straits to reach Konstantiniyye. The ship ignored the order to halt and was struck directly by a cannonball, sinking immediately. The cannon's test was a great success.\n\nAfterwards, Mehmed II ordered Orban to cast for him a cannon twice the size at a foundry in Edirne. Once completed, Sultan Mehmed assigned 700 men to guard and transport this cannon. It required 15 pairs of oxen to barely move the massive weapon. This colossal artifact, over 7 meters long with a 76 cm caliber, could fire a 544-kilogram projectile. The cannon was placed for a test firing near the Sultan's new palace. Before the test, nearby residents were warned not to be alarmed by the sound of the shot. The fuse was lit, the cannon roared, and the tremendous explosion could be heard dozens of kilometers away. The projectile traveled 1.6 kilometers and landed, creating a crater 2 meters deep. Pleased with the successful test, the Sultan ordered the roads to be leveled and bridges reinforced so that by spring, the cannon could be transported to outside the walls of Konstantiniyye. Meanwhile, smaller cannons were also being manufactured at the Sultan's foundry.\n\nThus, he created an artillery force using gunpowder, unprecedented in the East. Before these cannons, the stone walls of Konstantiniyye, dating from the Middle Ages or even earlier, were no longer effective defenses."

He coveted its neighbor—the moribund Byzantine Empire—and yearned to enter Konstantiniyye to rebuild the Bulgarian Empire.

He dismounted before the great doors, then stooped to pick up a handful of earth, scattering it over his head. In this gesture of Oriental symbolism, he expressed his humility before God.\n\nUpon entering the church, he walked straight towards the altar. He saw a Turkish soldier breaking the marble floor. The Sultan asked him why he was damaging the ground. 'For the faith,' the soldier replied. The Sultan struck him down with his sword: 'Are the treasures and captives not enough? The buildings of this city belong to me.' The soldier was dragged away by his feet and thrown out.\n\nMehmed released some Greeks who were hiding in corners and also set free some Christian clerics. Then, he ordered the church to be converted into a mosque. An Islamic cleric ascended the pulpit and recited a prayer. Following this, the Sultan himself mounted the altar and prayed to God, who had granted him victory.\n\nWhen he emerged from the church, the streets were silent. Order had been restored; a single day of pillage was deemed sufficient reward for the soldiers. The Sultan rode through the square to the largely ruined palace.\n\nHere, he recalled the verses of a Persian poet: 'In the Emperor's palace, the spider acts as the curtain-weaver; in the towers of Afrasiab, the owl gives the orders.'"

Well-versed in history, Mehmed was filled with confidence in his ability to acquire and wield absolute power. He aspired to be a world conqueror rivaling Alexander the Great and the emperors of Rome, and even to surpass their achievements.\n\nLater, the Greek court historian George of Trebizond said to him: 'You are the emperor of the Romans, no one questions this. Konstantiniyye is the capital of the Roman Empire, and the legitimate master of this city is the emperor of the empire.' George of Trebizond advised Mehmed to immediately proclaim himself 'Kaisar-i-Rum' - the Roman Emperor, successor to Augustus and Constantine the Great - and declare himself 'Padishah,' the Persian term for 'God's vicegerent on Earth.'"

The Ottoman Empire now, in reality, became a military theocracy like the former Byzantine Empire. Through a highly organized bureaucracy, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could exercise his absolute power.\n\nTo ensure this theocratic rule would endure forever in his realm, he codified into law the practice of fratricide, already prevalent within the imperial household: 'With the approval of the majority of jurists, any of my sons, should he by divine grace succeed to the Sultanate, shall have the right to execute his brothers for the welfare of the state.'\n\nIn Mehmed's view, his goal was to eradicate, or at the very least reshape and bring under his control, any forces that could potentially threaten or rival his personal authority.

Upon graduation, he excelled in both academics and battlefield performance, earning him the name 'Anavartulu Iskender Bey' (Lord Alexander the Albanian), which in Albanian became 'Skënderbeu' (Skanderbeg).\n\nDespite Skanderbeg's deep trust from the Sultan and command of significant forces, he secretly maintained contact with the Bulgarian Prince of the Serbian Empire, the Doge of Venice, and even the King of Hungary, longing to return to Albania.\n\nIn late November 1443, Skanderbeg took advantage of Rumelia being mired in the Crusaders' quagmire. He publicly renounced Islam, converted to Catholicism, and defected to the fortress of Krujë. In 1444, he raised the banner of rebellion against the Serbs, collaborated with the Bulgarians, and later blocked our armies in the north.\n\nSkanderbeg's ingratitude has harassed us for decades and brought us great shame, yet his military talent and fighting spirit were praised even by the Sultan himself.

These four great mountains supported the sacred tree, and the center of the world was here. From its roots flowed the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Danube, and the Nile.

His homeland shone with magnificent towns. The new moon rose, its light gleaming on minarets, and he heard the call to evening prayer begin, mingling with the sweet song of nightingales.\n\nSuddenly, birds fled from the crevices of the trunk, and all the leaves turned into curved swords. A fierce wind arose, a violent gale carrying the sword-like leaves towards Konstantiniyye. Konstantiniyye, between two seas and two continents, shone like a diamond set between two sapphires and two emeralds, becoming the most precious gem on the ring of the world.\n\nUpon waking, Osman told this dream to the Sheikh Edebali. The latter interpreted it as an omen of world conquest; Osman would receive endless glory and power.
