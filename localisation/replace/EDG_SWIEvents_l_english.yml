How fertile, how benevolent is that land! It seems one only needs to scatter the seeds of grain to be assured of a bountiful harvest.\n\nTime, however, is always ruthless in blurring the memories of men. People have grown accustomed to affordable and abundant grain. The days of hunger are gone, become mere bubbles in memory, forgotten in the collective consciousness of the next generation. Thirty years of sun and moon have passed without cease. Last year brought a once-in-a-century drought, yet, fortunately, grain reserves allowed us to pass through it safely.

The Free Swiss Republic's grain crisis has already surfaced, and the market is gradually sliding into an abyss. How should we resolve this? How should we respond?

Fearing riots and to secure high profits, the owners of grain stores had announced daily purchase limits on a first-come, first-served basis. After three days, the starving residents could endure no more. That night, they banded together, forcibly broke into the grain stores, and proceeded to beat, smash, burn, and loot.

The Lord of Genoa was a scoundrel mad for wealth! For money, he would do anything: road tolls, window taxes, residence fees, safety levies, water charges—a series of exorbitant taxes and cleverly named fees, collecting taxes fifty years in advance. When the tax collector came to him demanding a bachelor tax, he was utterly enraged. With one punch, he knocked the tax collector unconscious, bound him to the high platform at the port, took out a whip, and flogged him mercilessly. His uncle quickly gathered the crew, loudly denounced the lord's greed, and maintained order. Soon, the tax collector fainted. Meanwhile, the city guard swiftly arrived. Seeing the situation turn sour, they immediately retreated to the ship and soon slipped away.\n\nTime passed. The hot-headedness of youth was recalled today, only this time it was he who administered justice. As one crime after another was exposed, everyone anticipated a grand spectacle. Noah Hu Markus raised his right hand. The lord, his cronies, and their families were all sent to the gallows.

The majestic flagship commanded from the center; heavy warships locked in duels, dozens of cannons roaring, hurling explosions and death onto enemy decks and hulls; light warships raced for advantageous positions, lives depending on sail speed. Galleys swiftly closed in beneath the great ships, either to breach the hulls or deploy grappling hooks for bloody boarding actions. What a magnificent sight.\n\nYears later, Venice, its government fallen into decadent despotism, could no longer organize a large-scale naval battle and, as expected, was defeated. High upon the flagship, Noah Hu Markus pondered the Republic's future. As the fleet sailed into the harbor, Venice, this pearl of the Mediterranean, finally returned to the Republic."

After three years of university study, at the moment of departure, Noah Hu Markus gazed coldly at Vienna's city walls, thinking to himself: 'One day, Vienna will bow before me, and I will walk to Vienna's highest point amidst flowers and crowds.'\n\nThe 'Count of Vienna' was now pacing anxiously back and forth in his beloved Hofburg Palace, repeatedly asking: 'Has the relief force arrived? Has it arrived?!' No one could answer. Meanwhile, outside the city, the allied command headquarters was also deeply anxious. News arrived that food supplies would last only three more days. If Vienna could not be taken, decades of effort would be in vain. A grave silence filled the air. The allied commander, Noah Hu Markus, broke the heavy quiet: 'How many horses and mules do we have left?'\n\n'Over five thousand in total,' his deputy replied coldly. If the Count of Vienna refuses to surrender, we will absolutely not withdraw!\n\nFive days later, our Count of Vienna had fallen ill in the Hofburg Palace. His vassals, steeling themselves, went to request surrender. Both sides immediately held a surrender ceremony.
