EDG_SJK_ideas_7:0 "Defender of the Nestorian World"

EDG_SJK_ideas_1_desc:0 "While the Khan's sword conquers the four directions, the Divan's ink governs the world. Here, Persian viziers advise Turkic lords with wisdom, Nestorian bishops mediate disputes among peoples with faith, and merchants' tax registers and soldiers' grain ledgers intertwine on parchment to form the lifeblood of the empire. The Divan is not merely a corner of the court, but the art of Seljuk rule—forging the ferocity of the steppe, the order of the settled lands, and the faith of revelation into an enduring foundation of governance."
EDG_SJK_ideas_2_desc:0 "Since our ancestors galloped across the steppe, our warriors have sworn bloody oaths upon their arrows: to dedicate their lives and loyalty to the Khan who leads us and the faith that protects us. Now, under the Cross of Christ, this ancient vow is imbued with new sacred meaning—we are the sword that expands God's kingdom, the shield that stands for the persecuted faithful. This oath shall not waver, even unto death!"
EDG_SJK_ideas_3_desc:0 "From the domes of Isfahan to the bazaars of Tabriz, from the gardens of Shiraz to the schools of Nishapur—Persia, this land flowing with rivers of wisdom and art, now finds renewed life under the radiance of the Cross. We are not conquerors, but guardians and revivers. Here, Nestorian theology resonates with Persian poetry, the Khan's law mingles with the sages' proverbs. Let this resplendent pearl illuminate all the East!"
EDG_SJK_ideas_4_desc:0 "Since Saint Thomas's footsteps touched the banks of the Indus, the Gospel of the Nestorian faith has traveled like caravan bells on the Silk Road, traversing Persian winds, scaling the snow-capped peaks of the Pamirs, sweeping past the felt tents of the steppe, all the way to the palaces of the Great Tang and the yurts of the Khitans. Now, under the wings of the Seljuk eagle, we reclaim this sacred mission! Dispatch our monks, scholars, and merchants eastward along the Apostles' path, letting the light of the Cross illuminate all unreached lands—from the temples of Hindustan to the oboos of the Mongolian plateau, to Khanbaliq at the world's end!"
EDG_SJK_ideas_5_desc:0 "From the azure waves of the Mediterranean to the palaces of Chang'an, camel bells once linked the heart of the world. Now, guided by the Cross, we make this golden artery pulse once more! Restore the ancient caravanserais, purge the mountain passes infested with bandits, protect Nestorian merchants and scholars, allowing Persian silk, Indian spices, Chinese porcelain, and the steeds of the steppe to flow freely under our protection. This road carries not only wealth, but the empire's glory, the bonds of faith, and the Khan's mighty name!"
EDG_SJK_ideas_6_desc:0 "From the mountains of Anatolia to the oases of Khorasan, from the snow-capped peaks of the Caucasus to the fertile fields of Mesopotamia, our laws nourish the land like rivers, our iron cavalry deters evildoers like eagles. Within this vast realm, merchants need not fear bandits, farmers need not dread war, scholars may freely pursue wisdom, and believers can worship God in peace. This is the Pax Seljukica—not weak stagnation, but an order forged with strength and wisdom, letting all peoples under the empire share in prosperity."
EDG_SJK_ideas_7_desc:0 "From the plains of Mesopotamia to the Malabar coast of India, from the oases of Samarkand to the streets of Chang'an, all who bear the Cross dwell under the wings of the Seljuk eagle! We guard churches with scimitars, defend the faith with law, ensuring the flame of the Nestorian name never dies. Whether facing the Caliph's jihad, the Khan's iron cavalry, or the slander of heretics, we shall prove—the radiance of the Eastern Church shall be reforged by us!"

estate_AK2_ghulams_desc:0 "Once, the Ghulam were the most trusted blades of the Muslim rulers. Taken from the Turkic steppes, the Transcaucasus, and Persian valleys, they were trained as elite soldiers from slavery, fighting in the name of the king across the lands. Yet, the empire now serves not the crescent moon but the Cross and scriptures of the Nestorian kingdom. With the consolidation of royal power and the transformation of faith, continued reliance on slave soldiers seems out of place. Since we are now the chosen people of God, it is time for the army to be composed of free men and believers, not the slave legacy of the old order."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_1:0 "Expand Ghulam Recruitment"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_1_desc:0 "The former slave soldiers have now become the backbone of our army. Since we are no longer Muslim, continuing to use slaves is no longer fitting. We need to shift towards more traditional methods of recruiting new Ghulam."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_2:0 "Ghulam Detachments"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_2_desc:0 "Most soldiers in the army still prefer fighting with horses and bows. But the Ghulam are proficient with firearms. By properly integrating the Ghulam into the army, we can utilize their tactics to defeat enemy forces."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_3:0 "Reform the Yenicheri Corps"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_3_desc:0 "With the rise of the Nestorian kingdom, the imperial military system underwent drastic reform. The Ghulam system demonstrated formidable combat effectiveness through prolonged warfare, while the Ottoman Yenicheri corps system was renowned for its rigorous selection and loyalty. These two systems are now reintegrated under our rule, giving birth to an entirely new elite corps. This corps recruits youths from Turkic, Persian, and Caucasian backgrounds, jointly nurtured by monasteries and military camps. They receive strict military training, complete their baptism before adulthood, and swear allegiance to the Empire and the Faith. Freed from the constraints of tribe and nobility, they obey only the royal authority and divine will, seen as the 'Holy Military Servants' of the new age. The establishment of this new corps will fundamentally reshape the landscape of the imperial military system. The monarchy will gain an unparalleled military instrument, yet it will also heighten the vigilance and discontent of the nobility and the old tribes."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_4:0 "Elite Ghulam Cavalry"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_4_desc:0 "The shock power of Ghulam cavalry combined with the discipline of the Yenicheri has given rise to a brand-new elite corps. These cavalrymen are directly selected by the royal authority, trained from youth in monasteries and military camps, inheriting both the Turkic-Persian equestrian tradition and forged in loyalty by Nestorian faith and military command. No longer attached to tribes and nobility, they are the personal army of the imperial throne, the perfect embodiment of faith and centralized authority."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_5:0 "Curb Ghulam Power"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_5_desc:0 "The Ghulam have repeatedly distinguished themselves in battle, yet they have gradually grown powerful, controlling armies and land, even threatening the stability of the empire. Only by curbing Ghulam power, reclaiming military and administrative authority for the royal court, can we prevent the empire from plunging into division once more."
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_6:0 "Gunpowder Empire"
estate_ghulams_EDG_AK2_privilege_6_desc:0 "As gunpowder technology gradually spreads through the army, cannons and matchlocks have changed the face of war. Knights' plate armor and nomads' horse archery can no longer dominate the battlefield; thick walls crumble into rubble amidst thunderous roars. The imperial army, having mastered gunpowder ahead of others, becomes unstoppable. Territorial expansion, defense, and deterrence are all profoundly different. History will remember this as the new era brought by gunpowder."

Iskandar's autocratic rule and harsh policies have widened internal fissures within the Qizil Qoyunlu. Qizil Qoyunlu nobles secretly collude with remnants of the White and Black Sheep tribes, raising the banner of rebellion, sworn to overthrow the existing order.\nBeacon fires blaze anew on the frontiers; religious strife and tribal resentment intertwine into a storm sweeping the empire."

EDG_AK2_exploison_2:0 "War of Revelation"
desc_EDG_AK2_exploison_2:0 "When the hare is dead, the hound is boiled; when the birds are gone, the bow is stored away.\nIron and fire finally unified Iran. The King of Kings has fulfilled his promises, showering boundless wealth upon the meritorious. Yet, the day of accomplishment is not a day of peace. Those generals and warriors who once fought with no regard for life on the battlefield have not, as agreed, laid down their arms and returned to their fields. Instead, they have opened wider maws: they want territories, they want military authority, they want to carve their own thrones upon the very bones and blood of the empire.\nTheir greed is a bottomless abyss, a snake trying to swallow an elephant yet remaining unsatisfied. If left to their demands, today's Iran will be tomorrow's fragments; the hard-won unity from past bloodshed will again be torn by the blades of division.\nA dark cloud gathers over the empire; its name is—the War of Revelation."

EDG_AK2_reform_1:0 "Sacred Iranian Empire"
EDG_AK2_reform_1_desc:0 "Since the times of Cyrus, the Sassanids, and the Seljuks, no monarch has ever truly unified this ancient and fertile land. But now, under the protection of the Nestorian Cross, the wilderness and the plateau are once again united as one. The ruins of Babylon, the sacred fires of Persia, the temples of Antioch, and the domes of Samarkand—all are brought beneath the holy banner. This is not merely the revival of a kingdom, but the embodiment of a faith—'The Sacred Iranian Empire,' a realm ruling East and West in the name of God. The iron cavalry of the Ghulam and the Ghazi warriors gallop across the Two Rivers; merchants and missionaries traverse the Silk Road and mountains. From the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, from Anatolia to the Indus River, the empire's borders are defined by both holy banners and sharpened swords. All peoples, all tribes, all faiths must bow before this state."
EDG_AK2_reform_2:0 "Oghuz Confederation"
EDG_AK2_reform_2_desc:0 "Once scattered Turkmen tribes warred amongst themselves across steppe and valley, the blood of the Red, White, and Black Sheep soaking the lands of the Two Rivers and Anatolia. But now, under the shelter of the Cross banner, the chieftains and lords of the Oghuz tribes gather at the holy temple, witnessed by the Patriarch and tribal elders, to forge a covenant together: no longer to contend by bloodline, but to honor by election. Every Turkic knight and noble, regardless of birth, so long as they are loyal to the Holy Cross and the Oghuz heritage, may be anointed upon the future throne. In this moment, an unprecedented state is born: it inherits the glory of the Seljuks, yet is sanctified by Nestorianism; it is an alliance of steppe tribes, yet also an empire of faith and iron cavalry. The Sacred Oghuz Empire shall, with its new institutions and faith, rule over wilderness, riverlands, and mountains, and with its holy war cavalry, march towards endless conquest."

EDG_AK2_reform_3_desc:0 "'In a certain year of our Lord, the Fifth Kingdom of God descended upon the wilderness.'\n\nUpon the ruins of the old empires, dust has buried the crowns of four rulers.\nThe idols of Babylon are toppled; the sacred fire of Persia is extinguished; the halls of Greek learning lie in ruins; the eagle standard of Rome is broken forever.\nOnly the holy banner of the Cross remains upon the wilderness, snapping in the wind.\n\nThe Iranian monarch ascends the broken walls of the holy temple. The Patriarch anoints him with holy oil; the iron cavalry of the Ghulam and the Knights of the Cross stand arrayed on either side.\nHymns and horns echo from ruins and river valleys, like the tolling bells of the Last Judgment.\n\nThe people look up at the holy banner and cry out in unison:\n'The Four Kingdoms are destroyed; the Fifth Monarchy has come!'\n\nHenceforth, the Kingdom of God is no longer a prophecy on scrolls, but a reality forged of iron and blood.\nThe nations of the wilderness, the Two Rivers, and the coasts shall tremble, pray, or submit under the radiance of the Holy Cross."

It is time to set armor in order, take up sharp arms, and face this war sweeping the world with thunderous force.
