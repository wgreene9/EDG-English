GHS_1_desc:0 "Since the Muslim conquest of Persia in 656, we have been forced to wander, fleeing to various lands, secretly upholding our faith. Our brethren have suffered oppression under these infidels. But now, a Zoroastrian realm stands once more upon the earth. We shall raise the Sacred Fire high, and it shall never be extinguished again."
GHS_2_desc:0 "Our religion originates from Persia! They were once the hegemon of the world, renowned far and wide! Although that empire has fallen, it does not prevent us from inheriting their spirit, especially their diplomatic prowess!"
GHS_3_desc:0 "Our great Lord of Wisdom, Ahura! The infidels, deceived by the Evil Spirit, drove us from our homeland. Now, we shall take it back! Brethren from all corners of the world, unite! Let us wage holy war against the infidels and charge forth!"
GHS_4_desc:0 "We have a great ideal! That is to establish a nation belonging to us Zoroastrians! It shall be a great empire, its power reaching far and wide, and its greatness and prosperity can only be achieved through the blood of infidels! The pain inflicted upon us by the infidel faiths is indelible. Now, it is our turn to conquer!"
GHS_5_desc:0 "As we conquer the infidels, vast numbers of them now dwell within our borders. We shall make it clear to them: this is a land for Zoroastrians; infidels are not welcome. Convert or face death!"
GHS_6_desc:0 "Our nation is prosperous, powerful, and great! This is a realm under the protection of Ahura, a land overflowing with gold! All Zoroastrians shall gather here; this is our Promised Land. Praise be to Ahura!"
GHS_7_desc:0 "Towards the infidels, we show no mercy. Wherever we march, we kill, plunder, and burn all in our path! The Muslims who fear us call us the Scourge of Allah—a fitting name indeed. Let them hate, so long as they fear!"
