desc_EDG_personality_zhayide:0 "Zayid was the Grand Malik of the Zahid Empire, the second son of the great Safar I. He was framed by Ahmad Rosetta as the murderer of the imperial heir, Muhammad Zahid, leading to his exile. Ahmad even presented Safar I with an opened vial of poison, claiming it was the same poison that took Muhammad's life. Safar I fed this poison to a condemned prisoner in the warehouse; the prisoner died in exactly the same manner as Muhammad. Devastated by the tragedy of fratricide, Safar I's mental fortitude shattered. He could not forgive the murderer of Muhammad, but he also could not bear to see another of his sons perish. Despite Zayid's earnest arguments, as the direct beneficiary of his brother's death, Zayid's suspicion was never fully cleared. In the end, Safar I exiled the prince to the desert far from Egypt. During his exile, Zayid became a mercenary in the Mashriq region, leading a mercenary band of Turkmen and Persians in campaigns north and south, accumulating extensive military experience and building his own military force. After the outbreak of the Malik War, Zayid returned to Safar I's side, assisting his father in quelling the Malik War and restoring order to the empire."
