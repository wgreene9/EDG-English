EDG_ENG_earl_committee:0 "Council of Barons"
EDG_ENG_earl_committee_desc:0 "The Council of Barons is the legacy of three successive Baronial Wars in England. The devastation wrought by John Lackland did not cease with his departure to the heavenly beyond. The Magna Carta became a veritable talisman for the English nobility, and victory in the First Baronial War only added further privileges to this charter. In 1216 AD, King John died amidst shock and rebellion. His son, Henry III, was crowned the new king. However, the intervening French Dauphin Louis, alongside rebellious barons, defeated the Royal Army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings from a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding the power of local nobles. As early as the initial years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a mere pawn manipulated by the earls, who gained far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts. The First, Second, and Third Baronial Wars all ended in royal defeat. By the time Edward III inherited the heavy crown, England's true rulers were Queen Mother Isabella of France, her lover Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, and the Council of Barons they led."
 
EDG_ENG_anglo_against_norman_nobles:0 "Anglo vs. Norman Noble Council" # Anglo vs. Norman Noble Military Council
EDG_ENG_anglo_against_norman_nobles_desc:0 "For a long time, the noble factions within England have been divided into two distinct groups. Although William the Conqueror led numerous Norman military groups to complete the conquest across the Channel, followed by a land distribution famously known as the 'Domesday Book,' over time, the Norman military groups that arrived on the island quickly assimilated into local customs, becoming Anglo nobility. Those who remained on the continent, however, preserved their original traditions. During the War of the Four Kingdoms between England and France, many Anglo nobles, fearing death and seeking to avoid military service, preferred to pay large sums to hire wandering mercenary bands to fight in their stead. This mercenary style of warfare gradually became a tradition among the Anglo nobility. In contrast, the Norman nobility emphasized the formation and expansion of a standing Royal Army, believing that landholders should provide military strength and that only a professional, standing army of nobles was trustworthy. Now, the King of England has brought both factions together to establish a Noble Military Council for consultation."

EDG_ENG_royal_centralization_politics_desc:0 "The concept of Plantagenet Royal Centralization Politics originated from the Plantagenet family's emulation of the Kingdom of France across the Channel. After the painful lessons of the War of the Four Kingdoms, reform-minded English kings turned their focus to learning from their victorious opponent, France. At that time, whether England, France, or the Carolingians, all faced severe internal challenges of excessive noble power. Through a series of ingenious political maneuvers and ruthless suppression, the Plantagenet family ultimately redeemed past humiliations, sweeping away the failures of the first three Baronial Wars and establishing a true centralized political system."
