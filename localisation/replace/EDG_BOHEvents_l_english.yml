EDG_BOHEvents.0.desc:0 "Sigismund was the Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Luxembourg. Born in Nuremberg, he was the son of Charles IV. He was the Elector of Brandenburg, elected King of the Romans in 1411, and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1433. He was also King of Hungary and Croatia, as well as King of Bohemia. He dedicated himself to ending the Western Schism, finally convening the Council of Constance in Germany from 1414 to 1418, which elected the new Pope Martin V and ended the schism. However, during the Council of Constance, the execution of the Czech theologian Jan Hus led to the years-long Hussite Wars in Bohemia, which severely troubled Sigismund's later life.\n\nDuring the Hussite Wars, the Hussites in Bohemia roughly developed into four factions: the Taborites, the Utraquists (or Calixtines), the Orphans, and the Picards. Among them, the Taborites claimed to have inherited the most orthodox ideas of Jan Hus and were also known as the Orthodox faction. Their main constituents were peasants, miners, the urban lower classes, and some minor nobles, forming the largest armed force during the Hussite Wars. The Utraquists were a reformist Hussite group centered around the Prague City League, established based on the ambiguous platform of the Four Articles of Prague. Their stance during the war was unstable, and they primarily consisted of the urban lower classes, the middle class, and some major nobles. The Orphans were essentially a splinter group from the Taborites. Unlike the Taborites, most of their leaders were nobles. After the split, their commander, Jan Žižka, marched into eastern Bohemia. While Žižka attracted the main forces of Sigismund's coalition in western Bohemia, the Orphans seized the entire region of Moravia, using it as a base to harass surrounding areas and spread Hussitism to Poland, Slovakia, and Silesia. The Picards, as a more radical faction within the Taborites, had a certain materialist tendency, making them difficult to propagate in the generally idealistic social environment of the time. Consequently, their adherents were extremely fanatical and dissatisfied with the Taborite platform, leading to a rebellion against the Taborites. This rebellion was crushed by Jan Žižka, and the Picard armed forces vanished, though their followers remained hidden in various places.\n\nIn the early stages of the Hussite Wars, the Taborites, led by Jan Žižka, achieved victory after victory. Almost every battle saw smaller peasant armies defeat the mercenaries and noble knights led by Sigismund. This allowed Hussitism to spread rapidly throughout Bohemia and begin to spread to surrounding areas. At its peak, the peasant rebel forces occupied over two-thirds of the cities and villages in Bohemia. However, victory did not bring stability; instead, it fueled division. The Utraquists were the first to split from the Taborites, followed by the split of the Orphans and the rebellion of the Picards. These divisions continuously reduced the scale of the rebel forces, enabling Sigismund to later defeat the scattered rebel armies one by one. After Jan Žižka's death from illness in 1424, the peasant rebel forces began to lose to the Crusaders, but armed rebellion persisted for another decade. Finally, in 1434, the Catholic coalition defeated the combined forces of the Taborites and Orphans. The Taborites' last armed forces within the Czech lands were completely destroyed, and the Orphans, along with Taborite remnants, retreated to Moravia. In the same year, the Utraquists compromised and reconciled with Sigismund. The emperor gained full control of Prague and was formally crowned King of Bohemia. In Moravia, after the death of commander Jan Žižka, the nobles sought reconciliation with Sigismund but were controlled by priests and peasants. With the support of Taborite remnants, a theocratic government was established in Moravia, restoring Taborite traditions. However, Sigismund was by then unable to advance into Moravia and had to let it be, thus ending the Hussite Wars.\n\nFor Sigismund, the outcome of the Hussite Wars could be considered a 'failed victory.' The existence of Moravia continued to inspire surrounding Hussite believers. The Hussites in the Slovak mountains had never been completely eradicated by Hungary, with each result being merely a suppression. In the more eastern Polish region, Sandomierz had already accepted Hussitism. The followers of Hus were always ready to unite, awaiting the right moment to rise up and together overthrow the rule of all tyrants."

EDG_BOHEvents.2.desc:0 "In the early stages of the Hussite Wars, the lower-class citizens, middle class, and some major nobles of Prague established a Hussite urban militia based on the Four Articles of Prague, known as the Prague City League. This league took the second article of the platform—the demand for the laity to receive communion in both kinds (sub utraque specie), i.e., the chalice—as the representative symbol of the faction, hence they were called the Utraquists (or Chalice faction).\n\nDue to the ambiguity and interpretability of the Four Articles of Prague, this platform was generally accepted by the middle class and lower-class populace. However, their zeal for struggle was relatively lower compared to the radical Taborites. Therefore, during the Hussite Wars, they repeatedly compromised with Sigismund, leading to a shift in the balance of power in the war.\n\nAlthough in the eyes of radical Hussite followers like the Taborites, the Utraquists were seen as fence-sitters, it is undeniable that their existence still improved the living standards of Bohemian peasants to some extent. As the first faction to reconcile with Sigismund, the Utraquists, as a heretical group, retained much of their power after the war, laying the groundwork for their later resurgence in leading the Hussites.\n\nIn 1444, George of Podebrady became the leader of the Utraquists and began preparing to march on Prague after Sigismund's death, aiming to lead the Hussite believers to rule Bohemia. Not long after Sigismund's death, George claimed the Bohemian crown, declaring that Sigismund was merely a Hungarian tyrant and that he would guide Hussite followers to eradicate other tyrants and powers coveting the throne, as well as to destroy the exploitative Church oppressing the Czechs. Although Prague's defenses were strong, with the help of internal Hussite believers, George quickly gained full control of the city and forced the wealthy class and major nobles to accept the Four Articles of Prague.\n\nGeorge soon announced the establishment of a new Prague City League, declaring that Hussitism would once again baptize all of Bohemia. The news that Prague was again under Hussite control quickly spread throughout and beyond Bohemia. The major nobles from various regions soon formed alliances and counterattacked against George. Meanwhile, Hussite believers who had been hidden for over a decade rose up in support of George. War once again descended upon Bohemia..."

EDG_BOHEvents.5.desc:0 "Life as a professor and preacher at the University of Wittenberg for seven years was far from dull; it greatly enriched his knowledge. While studying Greek, he discovered that the Latin translation of the Bible greatly distorted the original text. Combined with the corrupt Church's demand for greater secular power, this preacher cautiously employed his peasant wisdom to write that the Pope's good intentions were merely misunderstood. True believers demanded punishment, not simply the purchase of an indulgence. How could the Pope be concerned only with money?\n\nHe began to compile his thoughts regarding the abuse of divine authority into a document written in Latin, the Ninety-five Theses, and posted it on the church door. Superficially, this document contained no words likely to incite riots or rebellion, but its underlying meaning ignited people's anger and stirred the carefully concealed contempt within their hearts. However, it was written in Latin, with limited readership. When people heard its content translated into German, their indignation grew even greater. Then, several unknown students brought German-translated pamphlets to the Saxon countryside, to the Elbe, Rhine, Danube, the coast, the Alpine regions, to all the glorious ancient cities and impoverished remote villages, Christian churches, knights' castles, royal courts, and finally, swiftly, to the Roman Curia.\n\nThe one most shaken by this document was its author himself. He began with astonishment, then felt fear. He saw his writing resonating worldwide, something he had never dreamed or hoped for. Suddenly finding himself entangled in secular struggles, he was profoundly shocked—this was something he had never anticipated. When he appeared at monasteries, town halls, and taverns, citizens and peasants gathered to push him forward, paying him homage, and eagerly vying to catch a glimpse of him. They told their children, this is the Saxon who recently refuted the Pope so thoroughly. Arriving in Heidelberg, he felt immensely gratified as the most renowned university professors and deans competed to shake his hand.\n\nThe people—young, old, devout, learned—for the first time awakened a great sense of mission in this monk, whose heart was filled with fear, doubt, inferiority, and nervousness. Clearly, he now faced Germans of a different character. He concluded that it was they who had driven him to become a warrior.

The same decree, the same scene, and in the end, the emperor broke his promise.\n\nYet he decided to proceed.\n\nApproaching a table and seeing his own works placed there, his heart filled with trepidation. He noticed Dr. Eck was also present. Eck first asked him in Latin whether he acknowledged the book as his own, then asked if he was willing to recant his views. To the first question, he answered affirmatively in a very low voice; to the second, he hesitated, faltered, and remained silent for a moment. The familiar fear resurfaced. He stammered, words caught in his throat. They reluctantly agreed to adjourn, but at most until the next day. He quickly regained his composure and wrote to a friend that evening, stating, 'Even if Christ forgives, I will never renounce a single word.' When he re-entered the conference hall the following evening, he felt a surge of confidence.\n\nInitially, he responded in Latin, his sentences elegant yet protracted. His opponent, Eck, grew somewhat impatient with these ornate phrases and demanded a clear answer in German. Thus, he began his defense in a tone entirely different from the day before, firm and resolute.\n\n"Since His Imperial Majesty and the noble gentlemen require a simple answer, I shall speak plainly: Unless I am proven to have acted contrary to the Holy Scriptures or to have committed other clearly evidenced offenses, I shall remain as I have been. My conscience is at peace because my actions align with God's teachings. I do not trust the unfounded words of the Pope and the Curia, for facts show their statements are erroneous and often self-contradictory. I cannot and will not recant what I have said, for acting against conscience is neither beneficial nor honorable."\n\nThe emperor posed a question: "According to your view, has the Curia also erred?"\n\n"The decisions of the Council of Constance," he replied, "clearly contradict the explicit doctrines of the Holy Scriptures." As he spoke, he raised a warning finger, much like that other theologian had done years before.\n\nHearing this, the emperor leisurely rose and led his retinue out of the hall. Eck, seeing himself forced into a direct confrontation, was relieved when the emperor departed and ceased speaking. He had prepared for a great battle; now, without an opponent, he could not hide his disappointment. The meeting ended abruptly amid clamorous voices and applause from the crowd, who congratulated the monk.\n\nOn the steps, candlelight flickered.\n\nFrom the palace gate came the coachman's shout: "Tie him to the stake and burn him!"\n\nFinally, he returned to the streets—"

EDG_BOHEvents.7.desc:0 "In those days, everyone sensed that the people stood with this monk. The princes, too, hoping to gain his support in their self-interested struggles, sought in every way to curry his favor, sending ministers to visit him. One bishop even wished to invite him to his own diocese, lest he yield to the Church council. But he thought of Hus and shook his head.\n\nHis heart felt joy as he returned to his original status and identity: a poet, a long-suppressed man, and a seeker of God. One day, he opened Erasmus's Greek Bible and translated its sacred content into his beloved German. From Walther von der Vogelweide to Goethe, all who have appreciated his beautiful language speak of his German translation of the Bible with deep respect. This may well be his greatest contribution.\n\nNot long after, the turmoil he had stirred surged back to impact him. His books were burned, the emperor's edict of ban—'He is a devil, he has destroyed all order'—sparked rumors and gossip, and the sale of indulgences surged anew, worse than before. The first cries heard that night in Worms resonated powerfully throughout Germany. Soon, the people raised their voices—the long-suppressed cries of slaves whose opinions had never been heeded. Both the knightly and peasant classes endured hunger, living without hope. This was a country long torn apart by the greed of imperial nobles, with religious authority held beyond the Alps. Now, the people stormed into churches, abolished Mass, desecrated the Eucharist, and tore paintings from the walls. Monks and nuns fled their monasteries to enter into marriage. They abandoned the contradictory Scripture, seeking the true God. In Meissen, Thuringia, and the Nordmark, the movement grew even more profound.\n\nThough feeling secure, he still felt challenged by a second struggle. This time, it stemmed more from his own initiative. A man unwaveringly faithful to his convictions ultimately had to become a new kind of believer. He decided to cast aside fear, protect the existing order, and stem the tide of rebellion.\n\n"Only my wretched body can halt this turmoil. Since God does not wish to protect me, my head is worth little compared to Christ's. Neither counsel nor sword will avail. God alone must reign; human concern and strength are of no use to Him."\n\nThe rebellious fervor of the masses began to subside. Soon, all the propertied classes—royalty, nobility, and townsfolk—breathed a sigh of relief. Yet, by doing so, he lost the support of the peasants, knights, and other discontented classes. As with all revolutionary movements in their nascent stages—"

EDG_BOHEvents.8.desc:0 "Müntzer was seven years his junior, also a teacher and preacher. He had once fled into hiding and was exiled. He was an itinerant preacher, a man who ignited the sparks of revolution. Initially, Müntzer followed him, partly out of indignation on his behalf, and partly driven by his own ideals and aspirations. Now, Müntzer used the language of the Bible to oppose the Bible itself, declaring Jesus a great prophet and God's most excellent son. He believed that God's kingdom and a paradise of happiness existed here on earth, and that even heathens could become true believers. Müntzer advocated for the elimination of class distinctions, for all humanity to become brothers, and for the establishment of a European alliance. Salute to the heathens and the Turks! Down with the Bishop of Wittenberg, who kneels before authority!\n\nMüntzer railed at him: 'Why do you address them as Your Majesty? They are nothing but usurers, thieves, and robbers, treating the common people like their livestock!'\n\nHe retorted sharply: 'You mad drunkard! Look at what this place has become, you irrational beasts! I had hoped to cleanse some souls with conscience, but it seems now only the pyre is where they belong!'\n\nHe began to disappoint. At that time, he was around forty years old. For five years, his progress had been slow but steady. Now he had halted, and there was a possibility of retreat. Who would seek to understand his youth and his character? The world saw only a man confessing his sins before the emperor and the empire when his life was threatened.\n\nThus, a philosopher who believed in free will confronted a God-fearing man pleading for forgiveness; a man of science and art confronted a pious, fervent believer; intellect confronted passion. The first European rose against the first German of his time, for it was this German who had gifted his people the German Bible, yet simultaneously pawned their freedom to the monarchy.\n\nNever had there been such a revolutionary against his own will. This man was so convinced of his inner convictions that he never wavered when called to testify to them. But when he saw that ideas could transform into action, beliefs into desire, he recoiled in horror—like a child who, in deathly silence, strikes a match to warm himself, only to have a great storm suddenly arise and set the entire forest ablaze."

But he himself would never act in such a way.\n\nThrough close contact with the miners and impoverished peasants of Zwickau, his thoughts and views rapidly developed and changed. He warned people: the millennial kingdom cannot be waited for; it must be seized through violent struggle.\n\nHe attacked the Church: 'With their lengthy prayers, they devour widows' estates; they attend the dying not out of piety, but out of insatiable greed.'\n\nBut Luther was deeply uneasy with these incendiary attacks, accusing him of 'preaching the Gospel and rights without regard for property and money,' 'fanning the flames everywhere,' and 'sooner or later committing murder one morning.'\n\nHe also relentlessly attacked Luther: 'They give you a cup of wine,' and you become 'a complete slave to money.'\n\nThe outcome of this debate was obvious. From that day forward, they parted ways completely. He finally realized that Luther was merely a clumsy reformer, offering comfort to weak flesh, over-praising faith, and undervaluing action. Opposing papal authority while denying indulgences, purgatory, dispensations, and other abuses meant only half-hearted reform.\n\nHe wanted to do more here—plan the struggle against the feudal nobility and the Church—but time did not allow it. The local nobles were already preparing to arrest this 'murderer.' At that moment, a monastery in Erfurt happened to invite him to teach Latin. However, he did not go immediately, because before that, he wanted to first see with his own eyes the homeland of Jan Hus, the birthplace of the Taborites—Prague."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.0.desc:0 "For decades since the Utraquists came to power, they have continuously exploited the ambiguity of the Four Articles of Prague, making arbitrary interpretations to further oppress the lower classes. The upper echelons of the Utraquist nobility, well-versed in the articles and the tactics of Hussite followers, know how to 'safely' oppress and exploit the people. This oppression does not manifest directly in the daily lives of the impoverished masses but exerts indirect pressure in every aspect. Over the decade following the Utraquists' rise to power, the people's living conditions regressed to pre-Hussite War levels, or even worse.\n\nKnowing full well the threat posed by the Taborites, the Utraquist leadership strictly controlled the free preaching of the articles, making the spread of Taborite radicalism extremely difficult. Taborites were often branded with other labels and executed by the nobility. Moreover, the Taborite faction lacked clear leadership during this period, and division persistently plagued this radical group. As a result, even though their influence extended across the Czech lands, Moravia, and Slovakia, they could not unite to oppose the thoroughly corrupt and degenerate Utraquists.\n\nHowever, the emergence of Thomas Müntzer shattered the Utraquist fantasy of continued stable rule. In 1521, Müntzer delivered a grand sermon in Prague. Initially, the Utraquist nobles believed this itinerant German preacher was merely a Lutheran coming to expound his Protestant theory of 'justification by faith,' which seemed harmless, if not beneficial, to the regime. The reality, however, was starkly different.\n\nThe entire 'Prague Manifesto' was filled with denunciations of tyranny and corrupt clergy. It not only criticized the Catholic Church but also directed its attacks against all churches oppressing the people and those preachers 'like devils.' Müntzer argued that Christ was not divine but a man like us, a prophet and teacher. He asserted that there should be no oppression or exploitation in this world; every person is free, and all property should be communal. Finally, Müntzer directly declared himself the heir of the Taborites, calling on people to take up arms and fight together against the enemies of truth, while inciting peasant uprisings and proclaiming that action in the Czech lands would signal the start of peasant struggles across all nations.\n\nPrague erupted instantly. The ruling class immediately branded Müntzer a 'German heretic' on the night of his speech, revoked his residency rights in Prague, and expelled him from the country. Although Müntzer was quickly 'escorted' out of Bohemia, his speech greatly inspired the Taborites. The people began to stir. Despite the authorities' ban on spreading Müntzer's words, privately printed copies of the 'Prague Manifesto,' circulated by Taborite supporters, spread like wildfire across Bohemia. A storm was imminent."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.1.desc:0 "The spark of the Reformation subtly mutated within the fissure between the Utraquists and the Taborites. When the German preacher Thomas Müntzer was expelled from Prague, the radical ideas he had sown took root like wind-borne seeds—the theological fortifications the Utraquists had built with silence were now met with a comprehensive challenge from the common folk wielding the Czech language and iron tools. This conflict, which began as a struggle over the right to preach, gradually tore apart the Kingdom's balance of faith, class, and geography, ultimately pushing the Hussite legacy toward a self-consuming abyss.\n\nThe symbolic objects of religious rituals became the first battleground. Led by Bishop Jan Šeleška, the Utraquists insisted that only gilded silver chalices could uphold the 'sacred order' of the Eucharist, while Taborite supporters distributed earthenware vessels to miners and farmers, proclaiming that 'the blood of God should be passed by laboring hands.' This confrontation soon spilled beyond the churches: silver from the Prague Mint was secretly melted down to craft chalices for the common people. In response, the Utraquist Archbishop authorized the conversion of three border monasteries into armories. When the struggle of faith began consuming Bohemia's economic lifelines—silver and grain—the once-stable feudal contracts developed fatal cracks.\n\nThe collapse of the power structure gave rise to a chaotic cycle of violence: to suppress heresy, the Utraquists had to allocate thirty percent of tithes to hire German mercenaries, causing local lords to drift away. Meanwhile, lacking unified leadership, the Taborites splintered into dozens of armed groups flying the Hussite banner. Among them, the most influential was the preacher known as Jakub Hlavacek. On the third day after Müntzer's expulsion from Bohemia, he declared that he had received the 'authority of the Son of Man' as described in the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel: 'The fire of Hus never extinguished; it hides in cellar barrels and miners' picks—now God commands me to ignite it!' Thus, on the eve of Pentecost, leading miners and utilizing the mine rail system to transmit commands, he launched a recent spring assault on tax collection points while striving to reunite the divided Taborites.\n\nBy this time, all of Bohemia had descended into disordered conflict: to fund their military, the Utraquists forcibly imposed a 'rebellion-suppression tax' that even included melting down church bronze bells to cast cannons. Meanwhile, resistance forces across the regions grew increasingly fragmented, with moderate factions secretly reenacting the Eucharist in forests following the old Hussite rites, while extremist factions emerged, burning Latin books and attacking scholars.\n\nThe catastrophic consequences wrought by this struggle were forging a shackle upon the land of Bohemia, with one end of the chain tethered to a gilded scepter and the other to a blood-stained sickle."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.2.desc:0 "The anvil emits an unusual blue flame on the third strike. Ekka turns the silver ingot held by the tongs, catching sight of the color dancing in the fire's heart—a bluish gold seen only when refining pure gold, now flowing across the communion plate he is forging for the church. Amid the bellows' gasps, where metal meets falsehood, fire reveals the cracks of truth.\n\nThe oak charcoal in the furnace crackles and pops. Ekka tosses the silver ingots demanded by the church into the fire. These metals from the Kutná Hora mines gleam with the ashen pallor of a dead fish's belly, tainted with too much mercury and greed. He grips the yew bellows handle passed down from his father; three short and one long pumps keep the fire at temperature. Black spots seep from the silver under intense heat, as festering impurities struggle to emerge from the metal's grain.\n\nWithout looking up, Ekka scatters a handful of borax, and the surface of the molten pool immediately foams with corruption. A tax collector in sable gloves ladles the silver liquid with a long-handled spoon. As the molten silver pours into the chalice mold, he secretly buries half a piece of privately smelted pure silver into the sprue.\n\nOn the seventh strike of the forging hammer, the first crack appears in the chalice embryo. Ekka knows this is a sign of imbalanced silver alloy, just as the church speaks of 'the laity also receiving the holy blood.' He returns the embryo to the furnace for remelting, adding silver coins brought from who-knows-where—clipped coins that once passed warmth through peasants' hands, now turning into starlike specks in the molten pool.\n\nWhite steam rises from the quenching tank, enveloping the workshop in bluish smoke carrying the burnt scent of holy oil. The annealing process lasts all night. Ekka wraps the gradually cooling chalice in deerskin, as mutton tallow wax flows across the silver surface like tear tracks. When morning light pierces the skylight of the smithy, the tax collector's carriage rumbles over the stone slabs outside. The newly cast silver bells on the carriage ring for morning prayers, while the copper wind chimes hanging between the workshop beams suddenly stir without wind, emitting soft chimes.\n\nWhen the red-bearded man comes to collect his custom-ordered sickle, Ekka is returning scrap silver to the furnace. Floating in the molten pool are offcuts from the church order, silver buttons from tax collectors, and a half-corroded badge. He tosses copper-zinc alloy into the roaring flames, watching metals of different origins lose their original forms under intense heat. The rebel roster brought by the red-bearded man curls slightly in the furnace's glow; the wheat stalks pressed between the pages gradually turn brown, like autumn harvests seized by tax collectors and later burned in uprisings.\n\nDuring the final polishing, Ekka sees Ela in the reflection from the chalice. His sister's phantom is dredging rusted crosses from the Danube's bed; river mud slips through her fingers yet turns into silver sand. On the evening the chalice is delivered, he discovers strange gold-red particles settled at its base—an alloy formed during the smelting of private pure silver and the church's official silver, shimmering in the twilight like the unquenched fire of Hus, silently burning deep within the communion wine.\n\nLate at night as the Vltava River begins to freeze over, the smithy still pulses with copper-red light. Ekka tosses metal shavings from various sources into the crucible, the bellows rhythm three times faster than usual. At the moment the alloys fuse, he sees the flames of war from seventy years ago, the sparks from his father's carving knife, and the morning dew on Ela's hair dancing together in the inferno, finally condensing into a new metal—neither dull gray nor crimson, but an unknown silver species flowing with iridescence, waiting on the anvil to be shaped into a new form."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.3.desc:0 "Before the river bend's ice fully melted, Jan was already kneeling in the muddy furrows, replanting spring wheat. The three-finger-deep holes contained ashes from last year's burnt wheat stalks, left by Utraquist cavalry who set fires while hunting heretics. As he used the grass rope Katerina had woven to measure distances, the worn skin on his wrists oozed tiny droplets of blood, dripping onto the half-cracked clay whistle at his waist—a piece Katerina had fashioned from shards of their wedding bowl, saying she would blow it by the mill come harvest.\n\nThe Utraquist grain-requisition team arrived during the last rain of the sowing season. Jan hid Katerina in the pickle jar in the cellar, stacking twenty sacks of chaff into the shape of a confessional. When iron-shod military boots kicked down the door, he stared at the reflective Madonna relief on a soldier's armor, seeing Katerina's eyes wide within it—they had ultimately discovered the sack of oats hidden in the cellar's false wall, saved for his sick mother.\n\nSeven corpses hanging on the gallows swayed in the evening wind. Jan's straw sandals sank into the blood-soaked mud at the execution ground's edge. Katerina's severed braid was tangled in the noose, still holding the oak hairpin he had carved last harvest season.\n\nThe wheat seeds in the sowing basket began to mold. Jan buried Katerina beneath the field ridge where wild mint grew, so he could see that stubborn patch of green each time he weeded. The Utraquists' new tax decree was posted on the mill's remaining wall, its parchment covering the star chart Katerina had drawn with charcoal—they had once promised to find the Shepherd's constellation. Now, the decree's edges were covered in bloody fingerprints, like some twisted celestial trail.\n\nThe night the Taborite rebels passed through the village, Jan's hut was filled with poisoned arrowheads. The leader's red beard was flecked with ale froth: 'Hide these. Wait until we slaughter all those Prague lackeys.' Jan touched the barbs on the arrow shafts, remembering Katerina's neck rubbed raw by the noose. He hid the poisoned arrows in Katerina's grave, and from then on, the scent of mint mingled with the smell of rust.\n\nOn the autumn equinox, Jan dug out the last half-sack of wheat seeds from Katerina's grave. The Taborite messengers galloped through, their horses' hooves crushing the green shoots, the iron shoes trampling right over the wild mint patch. Shouting 'Fight for freedom,' they then doused the entire river-bend wheat field with oil. Clutching the moldy seeds, Jan rushed toward the flames, seeing Katerina's clay whistle melt into glass in his palm amid the heat—that shade of deep blue colder than the moonlight on the night they pledged themselves.\n\nWhen the crossbow bolt pierced Jan's knee, he was kneeling on the scorched earth, piecing together the whistle's fragments. The rebels' flames had drawn the encirclement. A hail of arrows pinned rebel corpses to the charred mill beams. Jan crawled toward Katerina's grave, his fingernails packed with ash and broken clay. As dusk swallowed the river bend, the blazing wheat fields still spread, consuming all in sight. Lying on the burning ridge, he watched sparks and stars connect into Katerina's chart; wild mint ash clung to his lashes like a bride's veil.\n\nUntil the last wheat seed burst within his chest, Jan still clutched that half whistle. In the unburned fields across the river, wanderers stole ears of wheat to stave off hunger—they would never know that beneath this scorched earth lay all the promises of harvest."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.4.desc:0 "Beechwood crackled in the fireplace. Wenzel prodded the cold, tough salted meat on his plate with a silver fork missing a tine. The white frost of congealed fat reminded him of the midsummer feast when he was twelve, when his father used this fork to carve honey-glazed roast suckling pig for him, the garnet-studded handle flowing like blood in the candlelight. Now the third gemstone had long been pawned to the tax collector, leaving an empty socket caked with grease.\n\nThe scent of decay drifted from the apple orchard outside. A decade ago, this land grew the finest grapes for wine, until the Church issued the 'Edict of Temperance and Penance,' demanding all nobles plant golden apples symbolizing piety. Wenzel ran his fingers over the flaking enamel on his scabbard—the once-majestic family griffin now had only half a wing embedded in rusted iron. Hoofbeats sounded from the direction of the tower; he knew it was the Church monks sent by the regent to collect the so-called 'Crusade Contribution.' This time, he would likely have to sell his mother's inherited enamel reliquary.\n\nSlippery moss covered the cellar steps. Holding a whale-oil lamp, Wenzel passed empty wine racks; oak barrels once filled with Bohemian amber wine now held moldy tax grain. His fingers brushed the copper hoop of a particular barrel and touched a familiar fleur-de-lis pattern—a mark left last autumn by the old tenant farmer Josef, who paid his family's food tax. The sound of shattering porcelain came from the attic; the monks had probably discovered the silver-plated candlesticks hidden behind the velvet curtains.\n\nPassing through the armory's archway, Wenzel stumbled over a suit of armor. This ancestral Milanese plate mail, worn by his great-grandfather at the Siege of Vienna, still bore an unfixed dent in the breastplate—a mark of loyalty from a recent battle against the rebels, though this scar too would eventually vanish under the smith's hammer. He remembered the day of the armor-conferring ceremony, when his father fastened the griffin-emblazoned cloak over his young shoulders, its fine gold threads pricking the boy's tender neck—now it was old and faded.\n\nWhen the tax-collecting monk entered the hall, Wenzel was polishing the last intact silver piece—a communion cup engraved with the family motto. Wine stains at the bottom resembled a map of Bohemia, remnants of his name-day feast three years prior, before Taborite raids burned the eastern granary and the Utraquists confiscated half the silverware.\n\nThe monk unrolled a parchment: this season's 'Register of the Pious Contributors.' Below Wenzel's name pressed a crimson ink mark like the wound on his father's throat the day he was expelled by the Utraquists. He snatched the quill to sign in florid script, but the nib snapped suddenly, ink splattering a crow-shaped blotch on the document. Outside, an apple tree snapped, rotten fruit rolling to the monk's feet, splitting open to reveal fat white maggots, soon stained red with blood.\n\nAfter nightfall, Wenzel pried up a floor tile, retrieving his father's secretly kept Hussite dagger. The griffin crest on the hilt was obscured by bloodstains yet clearer than the one on his scabbard. He entered the derelict chapel; moonlight streamed through the shattered stained glass onto the Madonna statue—the saints' faces pieced together from enamel fragments now seemed to merge with the tax monk's visage in his eyes. As the first flames licked the faded tapestry, arrowheads broken in battle awoke in the firelight, carving the final family crest into the stone wall."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.6.desc:0 "As the silver fleur-de-lis crest floated in the pool of blood, Raymond realized the sharkskin grip of his sword was consuming the blood from his palm. It was his seventh year as a knight, and the 'heretics' he was ordered to purge were actually starving peasants wielding wooden rakes. A broken spear lodged in the chainmail gap stabbed his ribs with each heartbeat, reminding him of how the bishop's golden spurs pierced the warhorse's shoulder during his dubbing ceremony.\n\nMaintaining his armor in the morning mist became a sort of penance ritual. The night he was ordered to burn the village, Raymond's warhorse suddenly reared and neighed—this sturdy black Norman steed brought its hooves down toward an infant in swaddling clothes. As his blade severed the horse's neck, he saw the crest of a former lover's family branded inside the saddle—the executed blacksmith who had forged his first training sword.\n\nWhen the seventh pleading farmer was nailed to the oak tree, Gareth saw his reflection in the bloody puddle: white hair escaping the visor slit entangled the sword tassel, and poisonous flowers blooming from the gorget seam were pushing the fleur-de-lis crest into a clown's grin.\n\nThe moment the broken sword pierced the enemy's heart, Raymond heard the mourning cry of chainmail splitting. Thirty-seven pounds of heavy armor transformed into an iron coffin, dragging him into the depths of the mire. In his dying moments, the severed horse heads, torn scriptures, and crushed fleur-de-lis all reassembled into the outline of a wooden sword within the swamp's bubbles. The last silver fleur-de-lis crest to surface had been reshaped by blood and mud into a broken reed—a symbol more resilient than armor, more ancient than the blade."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.8.name:0 "Rotting Roots"
EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.8.desc:0 "While morning mist still clung to the elderberry branches, Anna was already crouched in the herb garden digging up parsnip roots. These roots, which should have been straight, were twisted into strange nodules. Ever since the Church requisitioned the upstream spring to dump holy water, all the crops along the riverbank had contracted this ailment. As she tossed the diseased roots into the wicker basket, she glimpsed figures burning the miller's granary across the river—the same man who had reported a farmer for secretly possessing a Czech-language psalter just last week.\n\nOrders for medicinal concoctions always arrived on the eve of fast days. The parchment scroll delivered by the novice monk listed mandrake, henbane, and belladonna, claiming they were for a 'clarifying tonic' for penitents. Counting the copper coins received in exchange, Anna found three clipped debased coins mixed in, their edges still greasy with goose fat from the monastery kitchen. She turned and tossed the bad coins into the clay pot of boiling beeswax; floating in the wax were hemostatic bandages she had prepared last month for certain uninvited guests—the comfrey juice soaking those linen strips was now dyeing the copper verdigris the color of dried blood.\n\nThe cobblestone road on market day was littered with horse dung and ashes. Anna crouched before old Jakob's herb stall, her fingertips brushing over moldy chamomile bundles—once the key ingredient for her mother's soothing tea, now the leaves seemed newly spotted with dark blotches. As Anna selected the needed herbs and prepared to leave, old Jakob suddenly lowered his voice: 'The Church has been raiding households storing belladonna lately, saying it's to prevent poisoning by malicious individuals. You should be careful.'\n\nUninvited guests scaled the fence on the night of the waning moon. They brought half a sack of rye, demanding hallucinogenic mushroom powder that could be mixed into communion wine in exchange—since Anna privately treated a blood-soaked man lying before her doorstep last month, such transactions had become frequent. Yet the once-tidy herb garden seemed overtaken by rampant thorns and weeds lately, spilling beyond the garden wall. Staring at the grain sack, Anna remembered the laundress bound to the pyre last week—the woman had merely used mint leaves to reduce her feverish child's temperature but was accused of witchcraft. She ground dried porcini into powder, mixing in an equal amount of mustard seeds—enough to make the drinker's tongue tingle without truly poisoning them.\n\nMorning bells startled the ravens in the herb garden. Watching monks dump so-called 'purified' holy water into the river, dead fish floated belly-up, covering the waterway. She retreated to the greenhouse, transplanting the last batch of sage seedlings into clay pots. These seedlings' roots were entwined with charred wood chips retrieved days earlier from the burned granary site, their newly sprouted leaves bearing ominous dark-red veins.\n\nThis morning, as Anna was distilling mint oil, old Jakob passed by her window and, as if by chance, let slip that the Church seemed to have noticed something, making the absurd demand for a whole season's worth of sedative herbs, and someone would come to investigate thoroughly this afternoon. While tidying the garden, Anna discovered a buried dagger. She watched the monastery's silver coins reflect greedy faces in the firelight; the dagger's tip seemed stained with specks of blood. From deep in the cellar came the sound of shattering clay pots—the stored mandrake roots were sprouting wildly, piercing their containers with human-shaped shoots.\n\nAnna splashed turpentine over the dry herb racks. Flames instantly consumed pharmacopoeias and notes; gold-leaf covers curled into serpents in the inferno, blood-written pages turned to ash in the thick smoke. As the burning greenhouse roof collapsed with a roar, mutated herbs burst in the intense heat, their seeds scattering with the hot wind into scorched earth.\n\nThe following spring, itinerant herb peddlers discovered new shoots beside the ruins. Old wives in the market whispered that brewing tea from these leaves could make one dream of the Danube before the gunpowder smoke—when parsnip roots were still straight as a maiden's spine, and the scent of mint had not yet been tainted by the smell of blood."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.12.desc:0 "When Carlisle polished the brass timing ruler, he always tilted it at a certain angle toward the morning light from the west window. Scratches hidden within the graduation lines would emerge in specific lighting, like fireflies imprisoned in metal, spelling out this week's rendezvous code. The cast-iron weights issued by the Church oozed rust in the corner, staining half a roll of vellum blueprints; he used the stains to sketch the guard rotation map for the Utraquist granary.\n\nThe workshop always smelled of whale oil and hot metal in the afternoon. The newly made mainspring handed by the apprentice gleamed with a sickly dark yellow tint—Carlisle knew this was the inferior alloy forcibly requisitioned under the 'Cast Iron Edict.' He ran his thumb over the gear edges; the gritty texture recalled the charred remnants of banned books burned in the streets. The star-iron shavings in the hidden cabinet exuded a chill—fragments of meteorite picked up last year on the Danube bank, now being filed into a key component to replace the church's pendulum axis.\n\nWhen the bronze hourglass from the confessional arrived for repair, its glass interior was already covered in spiderweb cracks. Before filling it with river sand, Carlisle engraved spiral patterns into the fissure gaps with a silver needle. As the sand began to flow, the fine collisions synchronized with the partridge whistle's frequency, and dust beneath the confessional's wooden floorboards danced along.\n\nThe day the moon-phase gearbox jammed, Carlisle found lead-gray debris in the meshing. These remnants from the Utraquist-forced alloy revealed peculiar reflective patterns in the afternoon slanting light—clearly the window lattice carvings from the censor's mistress's mansion. He swept the metal dust into a tin can of lubricating oil. The next day, while servicing the city hall clock tower, he deliberately added a cough-like tremor to the gear meshing sound.\n\nThe morning fog was particularly thick on the day for tuning the communion bell. Carlisle watched the newly installed star-iron pendulum cut through the damp air; the sound waves from the brass clapper rippled across the foggy curtain. The pendulum's shadow, meant to point to scripture, now crawled across the cobblestones, serpent-like, entangling the boot prints of granary guards changing shifts. A few jackdaws startled into flight, their wings shattering light spots that fell upon the star chart he had engraved last night.\n\nThe inspection team's forced entry shook loose the rainwater spout under the eaves; the pooling water spread into strange patterns on the bluestone slabs. Carlisle watched quietly as they smashed the gearbox, leaden metal blooming with indigo rust flowers under the hammers. A dull thud suddenly came from the city hall clock tower; the fallen bell weight knocked the newly cast sundial askew, its gnomon shadow skewering a certain erased year, startling flocks of pigeons across the city.\n\nAs dusk seeped into the workshop, Carlisle picked up a half-broken star-iron gear. The meticulously calculated meshing angles were dissolving in rust, like calibrated mnemonic chants, all ultimately turning into the soot drifting through the vent. Listening to the city's disordered chimes, he suddenly realized the most accurate timekeeper was the old pocket watch that had stopped years ago in the corner—the spiderweb cracks on its glass face perfectly framed tonight's waning moon over whose household gathering."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.14.desc:0 "When the saint's face on the stained glass cracked into three segments at the lead joins, Irma was dangling on a wooden scaffold forty feet high. The hemp rope dug into old scars around her waist—brands left three years ago when Prague soldiers dragged her from the dungeon. Now she hung in the shadow of the church dome, repairing the rose window shattered by rebel catapult stones; the glass fragments refracted the unfinished heretical symbols from the dungeon walls in the setting sun.\n\nThe gold powder supplied by the Church was adulterated with mercury, claimed to make the holy light everlasting, but each stroke actually devoured the glass's spirit. As Irma's sable brush swept over the Virgin's blue robe, the pigment suddenly flowed backward into teardrop shapes. She hastily framed the anomaly with lead strips; the squealing sound of cooling metal eerily resembled dungeon rats gnawing at shackles.\n\nWhen morning prayer incense rose to the vault, Irma found half a broken arrow on the scaffold edge. The shaft bore the starburst symbol she used when drawing coded messages for the rebels, yet the fletching was stained with the sweat stench of silver-armored soldiers. As she pried bat droppings from glass crevices with the broken arrow, the entire 'Last Supper' panel suddenly collapsed. Several shards precisely embedded themselves into the clergy registry in the vestry below, casting Judas's shadow upon the Cardinal's name.\n\nThe spare glass piled in the cellar gleamed with the murky color of dead fish eyes. Irma mixed new pigment with smuggled cobalt ore powder, yet painted the dungeon vent's star chart into the Virgin's pupils. When the inspecting monk sprinkled holy water beneath the window in blessing, droplets flowed along hidden grooves into lead seams, dyeing the cobalt blue into the crimson of the Hussite battle flag. That night, she was punished by being suspended before the unfinished 'Last Judgment' window for overnight penance. Blood seeping from the hemp rope rubbing her old wounds dripped, transforming the demon's wings into the outline of an angel of freedom.\n\nAmid the flames on the night of the lunar eclipse, Irma dismantled all lead frameworks. She twisted her body amidst falling glass rain, hanging the 'Genesis' Adam in a posture of torment. As soldiers rushed in, she was cutting the rope with the final red glass shard, while the collapsing window shattered the rising sun into myriad blood-red blades, piercing through the heresy registers in the monks' hands.\n\nWandering minstrels sang in the church ruins. Dice polished from stained glass fragments never rolled the numbers they desired. The mute apprentice who once steadied Irma's ladder now hawked cobalt-blue dyed saint icons at border markets—deep within each painting's pupils faintly glimmers the final act of Irma's performance."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.16.desc:0 "When mildew spots on the parchment spread into the shape of a new continent, Iselein sighed, knowing she had to remake the cover again.\n\nShe applied codfish glue to the passages the Church demanded be erased, yet deliberately used less than required so the text would reveal its true form more quickly; the oak boards for binding still carried the river's fishy scent—materials stripped from so-called 'heretical' books that drifted ashore last night, now being repurposed by her into new covers for 'Missal Regulations.'\n\nThe inkstone held two recipes side by side: the left compartment contained covering ink mixed from Church-issued lead white and acorn ash, the right hid elderberry juice and iron rust powder. Iselein's quill moved between them, the gold dust leaking from its tip always a few grains less than the mandated dose—privately hoarded indulgences, toll money for her father's journey to the afterlife, hanged at the well seven years ago.\n\nThe first rain of Pentecost week soaked the Czech-language Bible delivered by the guild days earlier. While drying it, Iselein discovered that beneath water-blurred 'sinful' script, the word 'freedom' was slowly being consumed by mold. She fixed the mildew spots with candle wax collected from the confessional; the finished tome's edges were covered in tactile bumps, seen by the Church as binding flaws, by some as braille code, yet she knew it was merely another proof of time eroding truth.\n\nThe recent escalation of conflict signaled that the struggle between the two factions would soon extend beyond debates over liturgy and doctrine. Everyone's patience was wearing thin. The city was already demarcated—here and now, it was black or white, with no room for gray. On the eve of the Annunciation, the final ultimatums arrived: the Church sent religious documents demanding the restoration of burned heretical texts and the repair of 'defiled' books; the guild demanded these volumes be 'processed' in their way.\n\nFate seemed to mock her greed and shortsightedness; between irreconcilable contradictions, there was no room for compromise. Iselein leafed through the books; once-familiar script now seemed strange, questions never pondered before grew clearer and more profound. The flickering candlelight waxed and waned with each turned page, mirroring the answer gradually crystallizing within Iselein's heart.\n\nShouts erupted from all directions. The dark curtain over the city was set ablaze, shrill cries piercing the silent night. When militiamen and inspectors rushed forth with pitchforks, flames were consuming the entire house; books, sacred or not, turned to ash in the fire, scattering across the city with the wind.\n\nSince that great fire, she vanished. The charred remains of the house were declared cursed, and none dared approach again. Yet fluorescent mildew seeped from the ruins—mycelium cultivated from the pulp of banned books, turning black when touched by holy water, burning when exposed to flame, growing in perpetual-night crevices into new scriptures—neither subversive nor submissive, merely honestly reflecting all folds untouched by light, quietly speaking the singular truth."

It was unjust! They have betrayed Hus's ideals!"\n\n"Silence!"\n\n"They preach that all may freely expound the scripture, but you have seen it—any sermon deviating from their thoughts is forbidden.

They use the pretense of free preaching for all to suppress dissent under clever pretexts. Once they detect an interpretation unfavorable to themselves, they swoop in like wolves scenting blood, slaughtering those who truly expound the truth. This is their so-called practice of Hus's ideals."\n\n"Those in Prague who call themselves Utraquists are already covered in filth and blood. And the people of Tábor, who initially followed truth's footsteps, have deviated since establishing their so-called independent church, becoming utter heresy. Look at them now—what difference is there from that heathen in Rome!"\n\nThe impassioned speech concluded. Seeing Kles's furrowed brow, the monk calmed down. Silence spread in the cool morning air.\n\n"Sigh." The stillness was broken by Kles's resigned sigh. "You may stay here, but remember: at the first sign of trouble, you must leave immediately."\n\nThe monk's face brightened with joy, and he thanked Kles.

Though not as grand as in the city, this was sufficient.\n\n"...Brothers and sisters, those filthy heretics have utterly distorted the sacraments of the Eucharist. God never existed within the sacraments; the Eucharist is merely a sign of God's body and blood... Whenever we correctly receive these signs, God will bestow His body and blood upon those who accept it spiritually, entering our souls!"\n\n"Bread and wine are merely man-made objects; they cannot represent any part of God. Kneeling before them is tantamount to idol worship; our knees shall not bend to idols! Those with ulterior motives have deceived us. Brothers, let us unite to change this. The sinless Kingdom of Heaven is approaching! Within it, there is no exploitation or oppression, no 'yours,' 'mine,' or 'his'—all live as brothers..."\n\n"...The Pope is merely the chieftain of heathens; churches are dens teeming with robbers; monasteries are but brothels for pleasure... All property, family, and personal plans are sinful; only what we create together is sinless..."\n\n"Seize that heretic!" Four or five militiamen suddenly appeared from the edge of the gathering, their leader's shout cutting off Sokolik's immersed preaching. He seemed to snap back to reality, looking toward the crowd below: the people were struck dumb, most wearing expressions of terror as if beholding a devil from hell. Yet a few villagers gazed at him with hopeful eyes, though such looks soon turned bewildered amidst others' vicious curses.\n\nAs the militiamen rushed toward the platform, everyone regained their senses, and curses against Sokolik erupted. "Burn him!" "He is a devil!" "Hang him!"\n\n"Neither God nor the Devil exists!" Sokolik tried to resist, still preaching his heresy. "God lives in the hearts of the good; the Devil lives in the hearts of the wicked!"\n\nThe militiamen quickly subdued Sokolik and marched him off the platform. The crowd seemed to exhaust all the Czech curses they knew against Sokolik. Had they carried clubs or tools, Sokolik might have been beaten to death on the spot, rather than leaving merely filthy and disheveled.\n\n"We are all immortal! God, like us, is merely ordinary..."\n\n"Shut your mouth!" The captain grabbed a handful of dirt from the ground and stuffed it into Sokolik's mouth. He tried to say more, but with foreign matter choking his throat, Sokolik could only cough and whimper. Amidst the boiling malice of the crowd, the captain continued escorting the squirming, uneasy figure away.\n\nThe monastery grew quiet again. Kles looked in the direction Sokolik was taken, shook his head, and silently closed the monastery gates."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.100.name:0 "The Wanderer"
EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.100.desc:0 "The origins of Kerry Evans, in his thirties, remain a mystery, though existing speculation suggests he hails from a noble but impoverished family near Brandenburg. He claims to have received a relatively good education, is proficient in Czech, Latin, and Greek, and possesses considerable knowledge of medicine, law, and alchemy. He once studied at the University of Leipzig for a period, during which he encountered various theological ideas, and afterward began wandering around Meissen, Thuringia, and Franconia. During this time, he attended lectures by some renowned theologians and developed deep sympathy for the plight of the common people at the time.\n\nWhen news of the Hussite civil war spread, this wanderer conceived the idea of traveling to Bohemia, the homeland of the famous Czech theologian Jan Hus. He wanted to see with his own eyes the 'Kingdom of Heaven' established by Hus's followers and set out for the town of Tábor.\n\nThe journey to Tábor was perilous, but Kerry's remarkable eloquence helped him successfully reach the town. Jakub Hlavacek, the commander of Tábor and leader of the Taborites, received him. Initially, people were unwelcoming toward this wanderer from Germany, but Kerry's fluent Czech and understanding of Hussite doctrine quickly dispelled their prejudices, and they warmly welcomed his arrival.\n\nLife in Tábor convinced Kerry that this was indeed the embryo of the 'Kingdom of Heaven.' Here, the principle of absolute equality was consistently upheld; everyone sought to establish a social organization where terms like 'mine' and 'yours' were unnecessary. Anyone arriving in Tábor had to deposit their money into the common treasury—a large barrel placed in the square. All goods captured from the enemy were treated as communal property, managed by the commander and distributed as required to each unit or fighter. All who came to Tábor called themselves brothers and sisters; class distinctions were utterly abolished here.\n\nDuring his time in Tábor, Kerry's exceptional debating skills and handling of various distribution issues left a deep impression on the community. When disputes over allocation arose, Kerry always provided outcomes acceptable to both sides; when difficult problems required solving, he used his knowledge and eloquence to uncover the underlying causes, offering fair solutions. Over the months Kerry lived in Tábor, his just and honest character won the hearts of the people, and his deeds became a widely celebrated topic among all members of the commune."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.101.desc:0 "Last night, Jakub, who had just returned from Moravia, requested Kerry come to the town hall for a discussion this morning. Jakub's eyes looked weary then, suggesting the war was not going well. Kerry pondered outside the door, but the Moravian region had always been a staunch supporter of the Taborites. The Utraquists shouldn't have recklessly ventured so deep eastward; something else more troublesome must have occurred.\n\nAs Kerry was thinking, Jakub's somewhat heavy footsteps interrupted his thoughts. 'I didn't expect you to come so early. It seems I've been neglectful,' Jakub said with a self-mocking smile, though his furrowed brow remained tight.\n\n'Not at all. Since the Commander requested to see me immediately upon returning from the east yesterday, the matter must be urgent. Naturally, I should come early.'\n\nJakub didn't continue the pleasantries. He opened the door and motioned Kerry inside. 'Come in, just find a seat anywhere.'\n\nAfter Kerry closed the door and found a chair, Jakub asked, 'Do you know who our enemies are?'\n\n'Is it not just those people in Prague?'\n\n'Also ourselves.' As Jakub spoke, he placed a notebook on the table. 'Recently, there have been constant reports of attacks on various communes and secret outposts, but investigations show the Utraquists have no reason to do this.'\n\n'What happened?'\n\n'Many things. Such as herb gardens destroyed, chalices stolen and defiled, and workshops burned, among others. The Utraquists wouldn't go to such lengths, striking us by desecrating their own doctrines.'\n\n'This is internal strife.'\n\n'We are still unclear whether these acts are coincidences by isolated extremists or organized sabotage. To protect the commune's safety, I want to entrust you with investigating this matter at various commune outposts.'\n\n'That will take some time and resources.'\n\n'Those are not the issue. The key is whether you are willing to take on this investigation.'"

Every day, heretics are arrested by the Utraquists, while the areas held by the Taborites strive to provide shelter for those branded 'heretics,' absorbing them to disrupt the Utraquists and strengthen their own forces."\n\n"Just two weeks ago, a young monk named Sokolik was disciplined by a Utraquist bishop for publicly expressing heretical views. The Taborites in the city offered him refuge, but he vanished without a trace about a week before my arrival—something unprecedented in the past. Some have mentioned to me their fear that Sokolik might be a Utraquist spy; Taborite activities in the city have nearly ground to a halt lately. They suspect the recent acts of sabotage could also be retaliatory actions by the Utraquists."\n\n"Regardless of the outcome, my primary goal now is to find this Sokolik. Being accused of spreading heresy is a grave crime. Moreover, nearly a week has passed without any action from the Utraquists, which is uncharacteristic of them. Meanwhile, a crucial piece of information has surfaced: someone mentioned that Sokolik seemed to have corresponded with a bishop far from the Prague region. However, the Taborites have no presence in that area, so I must go alone, and the journey will not be easy."\n\n"It's noteworthy that although Sokolik didn't stay here long, almost everyone I've met has a poor impression of him. Some said his heresy could 'rival that of the Turks,' promoting insane notions like 'Christ was merely an ordinary man; everyone can become God.'"\n\n"Past investigations have pointed to a heresy that can lure others into depravity, but none have directly described the exact rhetoric that led them astray. Or perhaps it truly is just a coincidence—identical circumstances arising from disparate rhetoric spreading amid the chaos of war.""

His earlier escape led him here seeking refuge, and the one who took him in was the local bishop, Jan Kles. Most villagers affirm that Kles is a very upright and devout man. Strangely, however, no one has seen Kles for two or three days since Sokolik's arrest."\n\n"While Kles's matter may need further investigation later, Sokolik's case is the top priority. Today, I obtained permission from the village head to enter the prison tomorrow. For the first time, I feel the truth is within reach. Excitement prevents me from finding complete calm; years of effort are finally about to yield their ultimate reward.

Following Jakub's steps, I arrived at a small town near Moravia, the place where the strange events initially happened."\n\n"Unlike the Moravian region, Prague's influence here remains very strong. Several uprisings the Taborites planned in this area either never got off the ground or failed quickly. Such actions led the Utraquists to impose stricter control over the region. Many commoners merely showing sympathy for the Taborites were hanged and displayed outside the town."\n\n"According to local investigation results, the main person affected was named Ekka, the area's only cup-maker, providing the sacramental chalices needed for rituals in the surrounding regions. The incident occurred at his workshop. To his neighbors, Ekka was a very honest man, doing everything by the book, and from what people could see, he hardly ever made mistakes. Most villagers sympathize deeply with his plight. Ekka's father participated in the Hussite Wars, but no one knows the exact time or which battles. According to the town official, Ekka also had a sister, Ela, who died last year after being hit by a stray arrow during a conflict related to an uprising. Since then, Ekka, who was already not very talkative, became even more silent. The last time people saw Ekka in public before the accident was at the square. A monk who had just arrived from Moravia was taken away by Church inspectors and executed a few days later in the square. Before his execution, he suddenly shouted blasphemous words, shocking everyone present. Some mentioned that Ekka did not show fear that day; instead, his face bore a hint of fervor."\n\n"The cause of the accident remains unknown, and the process was simple: the operating workshop suddenly exploded. Some described molten silver splattering onto nearby rooftops that day, dripping down like a silver rain."\n\n"Although the official conclusion was that Ekka died in the explosion, no one saw his body. The local Taborite leader, with his impressively thick, fiery-red beard, mentioned that he had gone to collect a sickle he'd ordered forged that very day. Under the guise of making tools, Ekka also forged various implements for the Taborites while casting chalices for the Church. Days after Ekka's death, the Utraquists raided the weapon cache. Moreover, the Church still hasn't found a replacement for Ekka; orders for repairing and casting chalices are now sent to more distant places."\n\n"Ekka clearly had value to both sides; neither faction would kill him without reason. Perhaps, as rumors suggest, he was influenced by the arrogant words at the square and began studying so-called witchcraft, eventually struck down by divine punishment? Maybe I need to look into the next location.""

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.200.name:0 "Destiny"
EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.200.desc:0 "In the night sky as deep as usual, the walls of Prague were tinged with the sapphire hue of a September moon halo. The astrolabe in the attic ceased its rotation; a sulfur brazier flickered in the corner, stretching the shadow of the seven-stringed lyre on the wall into a twisted shape. A scent blending ambergris and aged parchment washed over his eyelids; he felt himself sinking into the riverbed, yet the water's surface reflected a golden firmament covered in cracks.\n\nWhen his boot tips touched the slippery pebbles, the entire Vltava River transformed into liquid stardust. Dozens of phosphorescent cards rose from the riverbed, their edges adorned with thorn patterns forged from meteoric iron, forming a wheel in the deep violet night sky. The spires of Prague Castle cast Gothic shadows on the cards' backs; the bronze apostles of the astronomical clock suddenly broke free from their gears, kneeling before the wheel with candlesticks dripping quicksilver.\n\nThe card fronts flowed with a mercury-like sheen, sometimes showing an inverted papal tiara being pecked by crows, at other times a sun wrapped in spiderwebs falling into a crucible. As the wheel accelerated, the card faces melted into iridescent whirlpools. The sandstone statues on Charles Bridge awoke, hurling their stone scepters and swords into the air. The cross hanging from St. Vitus Cathedral sprouted amethyst grapevines, entwining the artifacts that sparked in midair collision, weaving a vast net covering all of Bohemia.\n\n"Destiny is here." A voice resembling the vibration of lute strings whispered by his ear. He saw the hem of his robe unravel into thousands of silver threads, undulating with the light spots projected by the card wheel. These light spots gathered on the river's surface into the emblem of the Habsburg double-headed eagle, then shattered into countless flapping ravens, beaks holding glowing fragments of the Hungarian Holy Crown, skimming over the scarred surface of lion-patterned water lilies.\n\nThe center of the wheel suddenly cracked open in a diamond-shaped gap, revealing the skeleton clock in Prague's Old Town Square. The bronze skeleton's finger bones plucked at the pendulum formed of cards; each swing shook down cascades of stardust, condensing in the noctilucent glow into the lustrous, smooth shape of a golden chalice, then gradually fading and decaying, revealing coarse clay as the gilded dust fell away, finally shattering in the flickering firelight at the cup's base, scattering into dust.\n\nAt dawn, he awoke to the sound of a crucible shattering. In the sulfur brazier floated unburned fragments; upon careful counting, their number was exactly twenty-one."

EDG_BOHDisasterEvents.201.desc:0 "The river wind, carrying the scent of gunpowder roses from the Old Town Square, seeped through the window crack, making his eyelids heavy as lead. As he fell this time, he smelled burning beeswax. Opening his eyes, he found himself suspended in a diamond-shaped corridor formed by twenty-two cards.\n\nThese cards were no longer flat images but mirrors framed in obsidian, reflecting countless versions of himself in different attire—sometimes a court scholar wrapped in sable cloaks, sometimes a pilgrim in rough cloth and bare feet. In one fleeting moment, he even glimpsed himself wearing a shattered crown sinking into an icy river.\n\nThe mirror surfaces suddenly flipped simultaneously, revealing alchemical symbols etched on their backs. The cards began moving in amorphous patterns, leaving trails of shimmering light in their wake. The mercury-cast planes refracted a cold glow, deconstructing and reassembling all the spires and bridge towers of Prague. The Baroque statues from Charles Bridge leapt from their pedestals, using shards of broken cards to build a floating spiral staircase. At the staircase's end stood the bronze skeleton from the astronomical clock—now tapping its ribs with its finger bones, each tap shaking loose cascades of glowing hourglass grains.\n\nHis robes were dyed deep purple by ripples; the hem grew roots that plunged into the void, drawing silvery sap from the astral plane that flowed upward against his meridians, condensing into an owl's pupil in his left eye. Through this rotating kaleidoscope, he saw projections of the Prague catacombs emerging from the card backs: countless skeletons wrapped in spiderwebs shuffling cards with their finger bones, their skull sockets holding phosphorescent wheels of fortune.\n\nAs the rotating card corridor contracted into a ring, the slumbering gargoyles of the Jewish Quarter suddenly stirred, their claws clutching not ordinary waterspouts but miniature cathedrals. Stained glass fragments paved a rainbow bridge across the night sky. He walked upon these sharp shards; blood seeping from his soles turned into rubies, falling into the boiling astrological ink below the bridge. The ink's surface revealed silver threads like lute strings, weaving together a disintegrating Habsburg lineage, each broken branch blossoming with the thorn flowers from the card backs.\n\nThe bronze skeleton's jaw suddenly opened to an impossible angle, spewing forth flocks of fiery birds pieced together from card fragments. As these blazing white creatures swept past him, the ashes shed from their wings coalesced in the void into three star charts: the first showed a double-headed eagle torn apart by its own talons; the second depicted a philosopher's egg hatching a winged hourglass under a blood moon; the last was himself standing at the center of a blank card, left hand holding a balanced scale, right hand gripping an upright sword, walking within an endless, kaleidoscopic vortex of color.\n\nIn the darkest hour before dawn, he woke choking on sulfurous vapor. His fingers, stained with cold ash, unconsciously traced patterns on the stone floor—patterns identical to the thorn motifs from his dream. Outside, a rooster crowed. As the first ray of sunlight pierced the attic, the ashes suddenly solidified into miniature wheels, hovering and slowly rotating in the beam of light until the morning wind crumbled them into golden dust drifting toward the castle—in the blink of an eye, everything returned to the familiar room, leaving only the laden dream lingering in the recesses of imagination."

EDG_BOHEvents.500.name:0 "Wagenburg Tactics"
EDG_BOHEvents.500.desc:0 "The history of humans using wagon formations for defense dates back to the 4th century, with records of Romans using wagons to form squares against Germanic tribes. Similar tactics appeared in France before the Hussite Wars, so wagon fortifications were not Žižka's original invention. However, as military technology advanced and firearms were widely introduced to the battlefield, the Hussite wagon, refined under his command, became a versatile tool—offensive and defensive, flexible, highly mobile, powerfully armed, and easily repaired—culminating in one of the most impeccable military tactics of contemporary Europe.\n\nThe core of the Wagenburg consisted of artillery and combat wagons. Specialized wagons, custom-sized for small cannons and mortars, could be mounted on four-wheeled carts, pulled by draft horses for rapid mobility. When battle was imminent, they could swiftly deploy into circular or square formations, placing muzzle-loaders on the wagons to deliver devastating close-range firepower.\n\nAlthough wagon forts had been used in warfare before, the Hussite Wars provide the most typical reference. Hussite wagons were modified from common four-wheel farm carts. The side panels and wheels could be reinforced with sturdy iron plating and removable composite armor (thick wooden planks). The top of the wagon was essentially a retractable defensive panel, usually folded to provide shelter from the elements, but lowered during combat to form a protective barrier higher than the wagon body. This panel had four triangular gun ports, allowing shooters to safely fire heavy crossbows, arquebuses, bows, and a type of light cannon from behind. Gaps between wagons were plugged by infantry with heavy shields or wheeled thick planks, later used to position heavy artillery. The inward-facing side of the wagon had a narrow door for crew entry and exit, and a specially designed long plank could be installed under the wagon during combat to prevent enemies from crawling underneath.\n\nAfter perfecting Hussite wagon tactics, the next step was enhancing their engineering capabilities. Besides standard weapons, each wagon carried engineer tools, including: two axes, two shovels, two picks, two hoes, two scrapers, etc. Axes and picks could fell trees to make planks for repairs, clear obstacles, or be used as weapons. Shovels and hoes could dig reinforced earthworks and sandbags around the wagons to defend against artillery fire and protect wheels and bodies, and could also be used with axes to dig trenches and anti-cavalry stakes. A wooden barrel hung between the wheels for firefighting and watering horses. Each wagon had a flagpole flying the chalice battle flag.\n\nDuring battle, each wagon was supported by about 20 soldiers, forming a small stronghold. Multiple wagons arranged alternately, interlocking, created a formidable Wagenburg formation. Importantly, the core tactical concept was not passive defense but flexible counter-attack. This was achieved by maintaining a small auxiliary cavalry force, primarily light cavalry, whose role was to maneuver flexibly in complex engagements, striking enemies engaged with the wagon fort or pursuing fleeing foes."
