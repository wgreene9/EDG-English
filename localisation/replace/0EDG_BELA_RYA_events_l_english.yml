EDG_RYA_events.101t:0 "Maria of Ryazan"
EDG_RYA_events.101d:0 "The former Prince Feodor II died at the hands of Oka's Bogomil mob, leaving behind no male heir, only an unmarried daughter, Maria. Though she may be called intelligent and beautiful, can a woman truly become a prince? Perhaps we should marry her to a powerful prince or his son and seek protection that way..."
EDG_RYA_events.101A:0 "Let it be so."
EDG_RYA_events.101B:0 "Ryazan must not lose its independence!"
EDG_RYA_events.102t:0 "Intervene in the Ryazan Crisis"
EDG_RYA_events.102d:0 "Envoys from the Ryazan boyars have arrived at our court. They claim to seek our protection, provided Maria is willing to marry into our family. Although they speak of respecting Maria's will, in truth, they merely hope to sell Ryazan for a good price. If our nation is willing to grant them some benefits, they will certainly choose us."
EDG_RYA_events.102A:0 "What happens to Ryazan is none of our concern."
EDG_RYA_events.102B:0 "Bribe the Ryazanian envoys."

EDG_RYA_events.103t:0 "Ryazanian Succession Crisis"
EDG_RYA_events.103d:0 "Though @RYA Ryazan is one of the oldest @UKR Rus' principalities, it has been in decline for centuries. The princely authority of Ryazan has long oppressed the boyars, but now the boyars have finally found an opportunity: by placing Ryazan under foreign protection, the princely authority will never again be able to suppress them. Located on the southeastern frontier of Rus', Ryazan is a tempting territory, and the boyars firmly believe they can sell it for the best price..."
EDG_RYA_events.103A:0 "Reestablish the alliance with Tver."
EDG_RYA_events.103B:0 "Moscow is the best choice."
EDG_RYA_events.103C:0 "Kiev is the mother of all Rus' cities."

EDG_RYA_events.103G:0 "And Ryazan shall remain Ryazanian."

EDG_RYA_events.104t:0 "Feodor Olegovich"
EDG_RYA_events.104d:0 "Though not the orthodox choice, Feodor Olegovich—the nephew of the former prince—also has a certain level of support among the boyar circles. Not only is he the closest kin of the former prince from the Olegovich family, but he also lacks a power base. Many boyars believe that elevating him to the throne will help them further expand their influence."
EDG_RYA_events.104A:0 "He is the one!"

EDG_rya_rerise_1_var:0 "@RYA§TRyazan Princely Authority Restoration Progress§!"
EDG_RYA_events.105d:0 "Contrary to the expectations of many boyars, Feodor is not an easily controlled young man. Quickly, Feodor took control of the court and halted the further expansion of boyar power. However, looking outward, Feodor sees that Ryazan is surrounded by powerful enemies on all sides, while the boyars remain focused on immediate gains. For the future of Ryazan, Feodor plans a larger and deeper integration of the @QAS Tatar tribes, both militarily and within the court, to strengthen Ryazan's national power. Yet reforms must have the support of the boyars, and there are no more domestic benefits to be conceded without completely undermining the princely authority. After much thought, Feodor sees only one way..."
EDG_RYA_events.105A:0 "Promise the boyars a share of the profits from victory."
EDG_rya_start_rya_fall_flag_tt:0 "Will enter the disaster §RRyazan's Living Space§!"
EDG_RYA_events.106t:0 "Maria's Secret Letter"
EDG_RYA_events.106d:0 "A close female attendant of Maria of Ryazan, daughter of the former prince, delivered a secret letter. It is filled with discontent over the boyars' various transgressions and expresses concern for Ryazan's future. At the end of the letter, Maria hints that she can help Feodor contact the prince's retinue and gather those loyal to her..."
EDG_RYA_events.106A:0 "Of course, I will defend Ryazan from the boyars."

EDG_RYA_events.107t:0 "Covert Plotting"
EDG_RYA_events.107d:0 "The boyars of Ryazan are weaker compared to those in other Rus' principalities, but together they can still sideline princely authority. The most powerful among them is undoubtedly Dmitry Lyaborsky. Removing him would leave the remaining boyars, even if displeased, powerless against the prince. With Maria's support, a successful raid on his residence and the fabrication of charges would seal the victory."
EDG_RYA_events.107A:0 "If there is no evidence, we shall create it..."
EDG_RYA_events.109t:0 "A Single Fatal Blow"
EDG_RYA_events.109d:0 "The corpse of Dmitry Lyaborsky was dragged into the streets of Ryazan. His body wore a mask used by minstrels, and Feodor shouted to the crowd: "This is the god he worshipped!" Dmitry was exposed on a small table, with a minstrel's bagpipe placed in his mouth as evidence of his heretical witchcraft."
EDG_RYA_events.109A:0 "Dmitry must die, for Ryazan must live."
EDG_RYA_events.1010t:0 "Restoring Princely Authority"
EDG_RYA_events.1010d:0 "The boyars have once again sworn allegiance to the Prince of Ryazan, but this time, court power is firmly in Feodor's hands."
EDG_RYA_events.1010A:0 "This is only the first step in reviving Ryazan."
EDG_RYA_events.201t:0 "The Grand Prince's Promise"
EDG_RYA_events.201d:0 "The Grand Prince has promised that newly conquered lands will be granted to the nobility. In return, the nobility must assist the state in establishing rule and provide military service.\n\nDuring the §RRyazan Living Space Disaster§!, each §Ynewly conquered province§! will grant £adm££dip££mil£ monarch points proportional to its development value, with a base ratio of three times, the specific ratio related to the nobility §Yestate§! loyalty. Each newly conquered province increases the nobility §Yestate§! land by 1%, nobility §Yestate§! loyalty by 1%, and tribal loyalty by 5 points. Meanwhile, during the disaster, the nobility §Yestate§! will provide a base income of 2¤ and 200£icon_manpower£ manpower, with additional income and manpower increasing as the nobility's land expands."
EDG_RYA_events.201A:0 "Serve Ryazan!"
EDG_rya_ruler_conquer_flag_tt:0 "If we are still within this §Rdisaster§! after the death of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the boyars will §Rcompletely control the state§!."

EDG_RYA_events.1011t:0 "The Oka People Move Closer to Us"
EDG_RYA_events.1011d:0 "The Oka Bogomilists, after their uprising, successfully defeated the armies of the Ryazan princes. They have sent representatives to Smolensk, hoping to become an autonomous region under our rule."
EDG_RYA_events.1011A:0 "United, we can overcome any powerful enemy."
EDG_RYA_events.1011B:0 "We have our own affairs to attend to."
EDG_RYA_events.1012t:0 "Integrate Oka"
EDG_RYA_events.1012d:0 "As our controlled territory now borders Oka, it is time to formally integrate Oka as part of Smolensk."
EDG_RYA_events.1012A:0 "United forever."
EDG_RYA_events.1014t:0 "Occupy Murom"
EDG_RYA_events.1014d:0 "The wars between the Muscovites and Tverians have exhausted them. Some Tatar tribes loyal to us, led by a minor noble, have seized the land we claim—Murom. However, Murom is under Tverian control, and our occupation might give Tver a pretext to declare war on us."
EDG_RYA_events.1014A:0 "It is best not to offend the Grand Prince of Tver."
EDG_RYA_events.1014B:0 "Not an inch of Ryazan's land shall be lost!"
EDG_RYA_events.1015t:0 "Ryazan Seizes Murom"
EDG_RYA_events.1015d:0 "The Principality of Ryazan has long laid claim to the Murom region we control. Recently, taking advantage of our distraction, they have seized Murom."
EDG_RYA_events.1015A:0 "They will pay for this."
EDG_RYA_events.1015B:0 "That land rightfully belongs to them anyway."

EDG_RYA_events.1016t:0 "Seize the Oka River"
EDG_RYA_events.1016d:0 "Tverian armies have marched into Moscow; it seems Moscow has lost the war. However, Tver's control does not yet extend to the southern bank of the Oka River. We could take this opportunity to control the entire Oka River basin, but snatching territory that the Grand Prince of Tver considers his rightful prize is like taking food from a tiger's mouth. Are we really willing to take this risk?"
EDG_RYA_events.1016A:0 "Hesitation leads to defeat; today it is Moscow, tomorrow it will be us!"
EDG_RYA_events.1017t:0 "Ryazan Seizes the Oka River Region"
EDG_RYA_events.1017d:0 "The Principalities of Ryazan and Moscow have long contested the Oka River basin. Though Ryazan ultimately lost the region, now the Principality of Ryazan has seized the area again while our armies have not yet gained control."
EDG_RYA_events.1017A:0 "They will pay for this."
EDG_RYA_events.1018t:0 "Deal with the Oka Rebels"
EDG_RYA_events.1018d:0 "The former Prince Feodor II died at the hands of the Oka Bogomil rebels. These Bogomils seek nothing but to oppose boyar oppression and secure their own autonomy. However, many boyars with lands in Oka wish to suppress these rioters and reclaim their territories..."
EDG_RYA_events.1018A:0 "You can only become sacrifices for the unity of Ryazan."
EDG_RYA_events.1018B:0 "We must not repeat Feodor II's mistake."
EDG_RYA_events.204t:0 "The Boyars' Power"
EDG_RYA_events.204d:0 "Nothing is eternal, not even the greatest of mortal princes. For a state, a monarch is never a necessity.\nThe boyars of Ryazan have gathered their armies and surrounded the palace, demanding the exile of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] from Ryazan. A letter of surrender has been delivered to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
EDG_RYA_events.204A:0 "I do not think I will be threatened..."

EDG_RYA_events.205t:0 "The End of Monarchy"
EDG_RYA_events.205d:0 "The monarch who still wished to resist was defeated without question, and the Ryazan monarchy thus came to an end."
EDG_RYA_events.205A:0 "A new era has arrived."
EDG_RYA_events.301t:0 "Disposition of Oka Lands"
EDG_RYA_events.301d:0 "We have defeated the rioters and reclaimed the Oka lands, though many original owners perished in the turmoil, and much property cannot find its rightful owners. This means these lands can be managed by the prince, though not entirely freely, as many eyes are watching our prince..."
EDG_RYA_events.301A:0 "Allocate to the boyars."
EDG_RYA_events.301B:0 "The prince should take the largest share."
EDG_RYA_events.302t:0 "Ryazan Demands Chernigov"
EDG_RYA_events.302d:0 "Ryazan has sent messengers demanding we return Chernigov to Ryazan; otherwise, they will have to use force to reclaim what belongs to the prince."
EDG_RYA_events.302A:0 "I fear it is best we accept."
EDG_RYA_events.302B:0 "We will not yield."
EDG_RYA_events.303t:0 "Chernigov Yields"
EDG_RYA_events.303d:0 "Chernigov has given its answer; they acknowledge Ryazan's rights over the Chernigov region and accept the rule of the Ryazan prince."
EDG_RYA_events.303A:0 "Excellent."
EDG_RYA_events.304t:0 "Chernigov Refuses"
EDG_RYA_events.304d:0 "Chernigov has given its answer; they refuse to acknowledge Ryazan's claims over the Chernigov lands."
EDG_RYA_events.304A:0 "Then war remains the only option!"
EDG_RYA_events.305t:0 "Reign in Kiev"
EDG_RYA_events.305d:0 "Kiev, ancient and sacred. She is the source of legitimacy for all Rus' princes and the pearl upon the Dnieper. Ruling Kiev means we have officially entered the struggle to unify Rus'."
EDG_RYA_events.305A:0 "Ryazan shall rule over Rus'!"

EDG_RYA_events.307t:0 "The Fate of the Tver Boyars"
EDG_RYA_events.307d:0 "Tver has been defeated, but there are still many boyars on the lands formerly belonging to Tver. They appeal to our great prince to admit them into the court."
EDG_RYA_events.307A:0 "Accept them; the legacy of Vladimir shall be ours"
EDG_RYA_events.307B:0 "They must prove their worth"
EDG_RYA_events.308t:0 "The Legacy of Vladimir"
EDG_RYA_events.308d:0 "Historically, the Grand Principality of Vladimir modeled itself after Kiev, harboring ambitions to replace Kiev, alas, cut down before completion. But now we shall inherit this legacy; Kiev will no longer be the mother of all Rus' cities but merely an ordinary Rus' city."
EDG_RYA_events.308A:0 "We will accept the legacy of Vladimir Rus'"
