EDG_mos_handle_nov_title:0 "Dealing with Novgorod"
EDG_mos_handle_nov_desc:0 "With Moscow now consolidating its rule over northeastern Rus', we can finally turn our attention to the unresolved Novgorod issue. There is no doubt that Novgorod must be fully integrated into Moscow."
EDG_mos_war_with_nov_title:0 "The Moscow Faction in Novgorod"
EDG_mos_war_with_nov_desc:0 "As we gradually gain the upper hand on the battlefield, the wavering centrist nobles of Novgorod are also beginning to lean towards supporting Moscow. We simply need to seize this opportunity."
EDG_mos_win_nov_title:0 "Reclaim Novgorod"
EDG_mos_win_nov_desc:0 "We have utterly shattered Novgorod's resistance. It is time to impose Moscow's order upon the people of Novgorod."

EDG_mos_win_nov_flag:0 "Reclaim Novgorod Flag"
EDG_mos_civilwar.101t:0 "Outbreak of the Muscovite Civil War"
EDG_mos_civilwar.101d:0 "Heaven's greatest jest upon Moscow is the untimely death of the great Rostislav. In the foreseeable future, Moscow's rule over northeastern Rus' will become precarious. Novgorod can legitimately break away from Muscovite rule, ambitious pretenders can reach for the Muscovite crown, Moscow's march towards unifying Rus' will be forced to slow, and there is even the possibility that the entire order of northeastern Rus' will collapse. However, misfortune may be a blessing in disguise, and a blessing may harbor misfortune. If Alexander can successfully defend his throne, defeat all separatist forces and pretenders, Moscow's rule over northeastern Rus' will become ten—no, nine—times more secure than before. Moscow is destined to become the master of Rus'!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.101A:0 "God bless the Grand Prince!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.102t:0 "End of the Muscovite Civil War"
EDG_mos_civilwar.102d:0 "With the civil war settled, Moscow can finally move forward once more."
EDG_mos_civilwar.102A:0 "Let us hope so."
EDG_mos_civilwar.102B:0 "Moscow shall emerge transformed!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.201t:0 "Novgorod Declares Independence"
EDG_mos_civilwar.201d:0 "Rostislav had successfully conquered Novgorod and become its Prince. But now that Rostislav has passed, tradition dictates that the Novgorod Veche must elect a new Prince. The Novgorod Veche is evidently aware of Yuri's rebellion. They intend to deny Alexander's right of succession and, as a matter of course, sever the union with us. An elegantly worded letter has already been delivered to Moscow."
EDG_mos_civilwar.201A:0 "How dare they? We must strike hard!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.201B:0 "After all, we have no good alternative…"

EDG_mos_civilwar.202t:0 "Yuri's Rebellion"
EDG_mos_civilwar.202d:0 "Yuri is Rostislav's cousin. Even while Rostislav lived, Yuri had subtly shown his ambition for the throne and signs of rebellion. However, due to his exceptional military talent and status, Rostislav still allowed him to command a portion of the army to fully utilize his abilities. Rostislav's death has caused Yuri's ambition to swell rapidly, and he no longer conceals it. Yuri has mustered armies loyal to him and is preparing to march on Moscow. This was expected by us. He has also delivered an ultimatum: Alexander must surrender the Muscovite throne, or else Yuri will have to seize it himself."
EDG_mos_civilwar.202A:0 "Submit to Yuri."
EDG_mos_civilwar.202B:0 "The throne belongs to Alexander!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.203t:0 "Dealing with Alexander"
EDG_mos_civilwar.203d:0 "Alexander, son of Rostislav. As the original heir to Moscow, Alexander still enjoys the support of many ministers at court. If we wish to maintain stable rule, it is best not to touch him. However, another opinion suggests that if we were to assassinate him, there would be no one left to challenge Yuri's rule. The only issue is that the beneficiary of such an act would be too obvious, likely inviting suspicion and attacks. Now that Yuri has become master of Moscow, how should we handle Alexander, this former Muscovite heir?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.203A:0 "Uproot the weeds to prevent future trouble!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.203B:0 "Do not act rashly. First, place him under house arrest in the provinces as a prince."
EDG_mos_civilwar.204t:0 "Vasilko Repnin"
EDG_mos_civilwar.204d:0 "Vasilko Repnin is an influential minister at court. The Repnin family is a branch of the Rurikids and also holds considerable influence in the Moscow region. Now, Vasilko has proactively offered his loyalty. How should we respond?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.204A:0 "Trust those you employ."
EDG_mos_civilwar.204B:0 "Do not employ those you distrust."
EDG_mos_civilwar.205t:0 "Alexander is the People's Choice!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.205d:0 "Yuri's usurpation has not been recognized by the Church or many at court. As Alexander grows and demonstrates exceptional talent, people increasingly acknowledge his qualification as Moscow's heir. However, Alexander has not directly demanded Yuri relinquish the throne but only asked to be recognized as the successor."
EDG_mos_civilwar.205A:0 "I will not be threatened!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.205B:0 "Agree to designate Alexander as the heir."

EDG_mos_civilwar.206t:0 "The Death of Yuri"
EDG_mos_civilwar.206d:0 "Utilizing his position, Vasilko Repnin secretly dispatched a hundred noble cavalrymen loyal to Repnin to Moscow. Under the cover of night, these men secretly entered the city. The Streltsy guarding the Kremlin had long since pledged their loyalty to Repnin and Alexander. Soon, Yuri and his confidants were subdued. Repnin presented him with two options: take poison, or have poison administered."
EDG_mos_civilwar.206A:0 "I am the rightful Grand Prince!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.206B:0 "......"
EDG_mos_civilwar.207t:0 "The Death of Yuri"
EDG_mos_civilwar.207d:0 "On this morning, people were shocked to find Yuri dead within the Kremlin. Soon after, Alexander arrived in Moscow and was crowned as the rightful Grand Prince of Moscow with everyone's acknowledgment."
EDG_mos_civilwar.207A:0 "Hail the coronation of the new Grand Prince!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.208t:0 "The Moscow Faction in Novgorod"
EDG_mos_civilwar.208d:0 "Within the Principality of Novgorod, there are those who support the Grand Prince. As we gained the upper hand over Novgorod, they promptly made their stance clear, swearing allegiance to the Grand Prince."
EDG_mos_civilwar.208A:0 "A favorable development."
EDG_mos_civilwar.209t:0 "Reclaim Novgorod"
EDG_mos_civilwar.209d:0 "The overreaching Novgorodian nobles dared to resist the rule of our great Grand Prince. Their laughable armies proved utterly defenseless. As Muscovite troops marched into Novgorod, all nobles opposing Muscovite rule have also been brought to justice. The question remains—how shall we govern Novgorod?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.209A:0 "Place Novgorod directly under Moscow's rule."
EDG_mos_civilwar.209B:0 "Rely on the Loyalists to govern Novgorod, though it must still be under Moscow's suzerainty."
EDG_mos_civilwar.209C:0 "Let the Loyalists manage Novgorod's politics for now; we lack the energy to deal with Novgorod at present."
EDG_mos_civilwar_209C_tt:0 "§GUnlocks§! a §Ydecision§! to integrate @NOVNovgorod."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2010t:0 "Novgorodian Independence"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2010d:0 "Novgorod the Great boasts a glorious and ancient history. Now, it has regained its independence. If we wish to make Novgorod the Great even greater, rather than bowing to others, this is a necessary step."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2010A:0 "Muster the soldiers, prepare for battle!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2010B:0 "This is a victory for Novgorod!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.301t:0 "Loyalists at Court"
EDG_mos_civilwar.301d:0 "Even in these critical times, the court is not without loyal ministers swearing allegiance to the Grand Prince."
EDG_mos_civilwar.301A:0 "I am the rightful Grand Prince!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.301B:0 "You should offer something more tangible."

EDG_mos_civilwar.302t:0 "Provincial Loyalists"
EDG_mos_civilwar.302d:0 "Local princes have sworn allegiance to the Grand Prince, undoubtedly demonstrating that our glorious Grand Prince is the rightful ruler of Moscow."
EDG_mos_civilwar.302A:0 "Loyalty should be rewarded."
EDG_mos_civilwar.303t:1 "Provincial Opposition"
EDG_mos_civilwar.303d:1 "Local nobles are preparing to rebel against our rule. Clearly, they are unwilling to acknowledge the legitimacy of our glorious Grand Prince."
EDG_mos_civilwar.303A:0 "Suppress them!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2014t:0 "Lobby the Principalities"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2014d:0 "Moscow is clearly preoccupied with its own troubles, and not all the principalities of northeastern Rus' are entirely loyal. If we can offer suitable incentives, or bribe influential court ministers, perhaps we can win them over to our side."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2014A:0 "There is no need for such actions."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2014B:0 "Give it a try; it can't hurt."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015t:0 "Emissary from Novgorod"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015d:0 "Envoys from Novgorod have arrived at our court. They have made a demand: that we should instead pledge fealty to them, as Moscow is already embroiled in civil war and surely has no time to concern itself with us. Many ministers at court have echoed this sentiment, believing that switching allegiance to Novgorod is the correct path."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015A:0 "Switch and pledge fealty to Novgorod."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015B:0 "Submit to Novgorod."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015C:0 "Go back and tell your Prince that we shall remain loyal to the Grand Prince of Moscow."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2015E:0 "Go back and tell your Prince that we shall maintain our independence."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2011t:0 "Vassal Disloyalty"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2011d:0 "Our regime is precarious, and thus people's minds are turning. Our former vassals are developing rebellious intentions. Perhaps we can pay some additional price to appease these princes and their subjects, combining both favor and discipline, in the hope that they will maintain their loyalty to Moscow?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2011A:0 "We don't have the energy to deal with them; let them be."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2011B:0 "Reward the loyal, punish the disloyal!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2012t:0 "Independence from Moscow?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2012d:0 "Moscow is already entangled in civil war and cannot spare attention for us. Perhaps we can seize the opportunity to declare independence."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2012A:0 "That is precisely my desire, I wouldn't dare ask for it!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2012B:0 "Better not."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2013t:0 "Independence from Moscow?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2013d:0 "Although Moscow is embroiled in civil war, it still seems capable of maintaining control. However, we could take the risk and seize the chance to declare independence."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2013A:0 "If not now, then when?"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2013B:0 "Better not."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2016t:0 "Vassal Rebellion"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2016d:0 "One of our vassals has betrayed us!"
EDG_mos_civilwar.2016A:0 "Damn them! They will pay for this sooner or later!"

EDG_mos_civilwar.2017t:0 "Brothers at Odds..."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2017d:0 "The Grand Prince of Moscow has mustered his armies to attack us, while the Swedes also covet our lands and wealth. Our situation has suddenly become precarious. Yet, what Moscow demands is ultimately a throne; it does not truly threaten our rule. But if the Swedes are victorious, we will lose everything..."
EDG_mos_civilwar.2017A:0 "Repel the foreign aggressor!"
