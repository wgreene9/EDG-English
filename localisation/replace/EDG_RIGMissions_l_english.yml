rig_hansa_league_title:0 "The Hanseatic League"
rig_hansa_league_desc:0 "Since the 12th century, North German merchants organized the 'Cologne Hanse' and 'Hamburg Hanse' to trade with England and Flanders. From the mid-12th to mid-13th century, trade along the Rhine River in Germany flourished, and the focus of foreign trade gradually expanded to the Baltic region. In the 1280s, merchant organizations in the Rhineland cooperated to protect common interests and allied with Lübeck and other North German cities controlling Baltic trade to guard against bandits and pirates, ensuring trade security. This was the precursor to the Hanseatic League. After its formation, the League's aims quickly shifted from protecting commerce—suppressing piracy, combating raids, and abolishing unreasonable tolls—to expanding commercial influence overseas, monopolizing trade interests, and suppressing competition from non-League German cities as well as from England, Russia, and Flanders itself."

rig_enemy_of_enemy_desc:0 "From 1368 to 1370, the combined fleets of the Hanseatic League defeated Denmark, forcing it to sign the Treaty of Stralsund. This treaty endowed the Hanseatic League with the character of a Nordic political alliance, expanding its control over Baltic and North Sea trade as well as Scandinavian politics. Subsequently, the fragmentation of Denmark further solidified the Hanseatic League's trade hegemony in the Baltic. Should we seek allies, the various free cities in Denmark would be our primary choice. Although we were once part of the Hanseatic League and hostile to Denmark, matters of interest may lead these city-states to reconsider cooperation with us."
