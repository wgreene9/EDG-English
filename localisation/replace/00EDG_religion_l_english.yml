EDG_catharism_religion:0 "Cathar"
EDG_catharism_religion_desc:0 "Catharism, also translated as the Pure or the Purified. It generally refers to various sects influenced by Manichaeism that believed in dualism and upheld asceticism. They were several minor sects from the patristic era and one of the Christian denominations spread along the Mediterranean coasts of Europe, also transliterated as 'Cathari' or 'Cathars.' After the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, Catharism survived in southern France, northern Italy, and northeastern Iberia, where it was adapted by the ruling authorities to serve the strengthening of royal power."

EDG_catharism_aspect_1:0 "Confiscate Church Assets"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_1:0 "Catharism flourished under the influence of the Gregorian Reform. The Cathars advocated emulating the apostolic spirit of poverty, believing that the contemporary church had colluded with the secular world and thus was not the representative of Christ. They did not consider sacraments performed by corrupt clergy to be valid. Furthermore, Cathars rejected all external religious symbols such as icons, sacraments, church assets, and hierarchical systems, opposing religious-political authority."
EDG_catharism_aspect_2:0 "Preach Christology"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_2:0 "Cathars denied the divinity of Jesus, viewing him only as the highest created being. They believed Jesus came into the world to lead them away from this material world, liberate them from this lamentable cycle, and reveal to them the truth of salvation. Christ was the life-giving spirit, a mere form in this earthly realm. Since Christ was not born of a woman, he had no human component; his flesh was not substantial, so he neither died nor ascended. Therefore, Cathars opposed the doctrines of Christ's incarnation and resurrection. Even the Holy Spirit was merely a created being, the foremost among all spirits (including angels and human souls)."
EDG_catharism_aspect_3:0 "Preach Armed Pilgrimage"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_3:0 "We are also an expansionist Christian sect; armed pilgrimage is one of our tenets. We need to proselytize through violent means and reclaim our holy lands."
EDG_catharism_aspect_4:0 "Judge Heretics"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_4:0 "All who hold different views from ours are heretics. Catholics and Orthodox followers have long been on the wrong path. We must deal a heavy blow to the heretics within our country to realign their souls onto the correct track."
EDG_catharism_aspect_5:0 "Engage in Theological Debates"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_5:0 "Cathars deny religious authority. Although they have been reformed by the monarchs of southern France to serve political authority, there are still many factions within Catharism with slightly differing viewpoints. Engaging in theological debates helps develop our theological perspectives, thereby serving progress."

EDG_catharism_aspect_6:0 "Preach Gnosticism"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_6:0 "Catharism holds a dualistic faith, tracing its origins to Manichaeism and Gnosticism, advocating the dualism where the soul is superior to the flesh. They believe in two gods: one who created the intangible spiritual world, representing good, and another who created the tangible material world, representing evil. The good god creates souls, while the evil god creates physical bodies. Good and evil are in constant struggle. This concept of two gods is consistent with earlier Manichaeism. Cathars view the evil god as the deity of the Old Testament era, who imprisons human souls within material, earthly bodies. In this material world, death is not a liberation but merely a cycle where the soul enters another human or animal body. Cathars regard all matter as evil; this world is filled with diseases, suffering, and desires, so the material world is inherently evil."
EDG_catharism_aspect_7:0 "Preach Commandments"
desc_EDG_catharism_aspect_7:0 "Catharism advocates non-violence, regards sexuality and reproduction as evil, and promotes asceticism. Their followers are divided into two categories: the 'Perfecti' and ordinary believers. The 'Perfecti' must strictly observe regulations such as fasting, abstinence, refraining from lying, and avoiding oaths. Ordinary believers are not required to adhere to ascetic rules; they only need to receive spiritual baptism, live ordinary lives, and are not obligated to follow strict religious codes. However, they must fully respect the 'Perfecti' and completely obey their commands. The 'Perfecti' are considered true believers who, after prolonged trials, receive baptism—a ritual involving the laying on of hands to impart the Holy Spirit. After receiving baptism, they must embrace poverty and chastity, live communally, and practice asceticism. Besides conducting worship services and preaching, the 'Perfecti' also engage in charitable relief and educational work, such as establishing schools. If a 'Perfectus' later fails to maintain the standards of a spiritually baptized individual, they must undergo re-baptism by the Holy Spirit, which involves voluntary termination through starvation or suffocation, leading to a forced death."

#Mozarabic Rite
EDG_Mozarabic:0 "Mozarabic Rite"
EDG_Mozarabic_religion:0 "Mozarabic Rite"
EDG_Mozarabic_religion_desc:0 "The Mozarabic Rite, also known as the Moorish-Arabic Rite, represents a remnant of early Christianity. Due to the prolonged Muslim rule over central and southern Iberia, local Christians were not formally guided by the later Catholic Church, preserving many Christian traditions from the barbarian era. The origins of the Mozarabic Rite can be traced back to 507 when the Visigoths entered Iberia. At that time, the Roman provinces in Spain already had a distinct liturgical tradition. Although the Visigoths adhered to the anti-Trinitarian Arianism, Spanish prayers notably emphasized the Trinity. The Visigoths exhibited great tolerance toward this heterodox practice, retaining firm control over the appointment of bishops. By the time of Reccared I, the decision was made to convene the Third Council of Toledo, abandoning Arianism in favor of Chalcedonian Christianity, which also symbolized the cultural fusion between the Visigoths and the Spanish Romans. The only latent issue was the Council's inclusion of the Filioque clause—the highly contentious doctrine that "the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son"—into the Nicene Creed, sowing the seeds for the East-West Schism of 1054. Under Visigothic patronage, the Spanish Rite reached its zenith, with religious activities becoming standardized, and distinct religious traditions began to emerge between northern and southern Iberia. Due to Justinian I's short-lived Byzantine province of Spania and the exile experiences of Archbishop Leander of Seville in the Eastern Roman Empire, the southern Spanish Rite exhibited pronounced Byzantine religious characteristics, which became a defining feature of the Mozarabic Rite. This golden age ended with the Umayyad invasion in 711, as Muslims ushered in a dark period for Spanish Christians. The fall of Iberia forced northern Christians to retreat into the mountains of Asturias, becoming the forefront of the later Reconquista, though the majority of Christians and clergy continued to live under Moorish rule. Muslim rulers referred to these people as "Mozarabs." Although they existed as a Dhimmi class, they were prohibited from publicly displaying their faith or building new churches, potentially fostering the conservative ethos of the later Mozarabic Rite. As the Reconquista progressed, northern Christians began to counterattack and reclaim lost territories. Some Mozarabs fled back to liberated areas to rebuild abandoned towns and replenish the dwindling population, notably in the Kingdom of León, which was reorganized from the Kingdom of Asturias in 910. While expanding their influence, Iberian Christians also re-established connections with the Pope and other European nations. The region of Catalonia, liberated by Charlemagne, was among the first to adopt the Roman Rite over traditional Spanish local liturgies. As northern Christians underwent orthodoxy reforms, southern Mozarabs grew increasingly conservative, striving to preserve the most authentic Spanish liturgical traditions. Many experienced scribes within Mozarabic communities produced manuscripts in Visigothic script, which later became the oldest textual sources for studying the Mozarabic Rite. After Alfonso VI liberated Toledo, he reached an agreement with the local Mozarabs, promising not to forcibly impose the Roman Rite in exchange for their support of the Reconquista."

#Waldensians
EDG_Waldenses:0 "Waldensian"
EDG_Waldenses_religion:0 "Waldensian"
EDG_Waldenses_religion_desc:0 "Waldensians are typically classified within Protestantism and are considered a pre-Reformation Protestant movement. Initially known as the 'Poor of Lyons,' they were merely a small movement formed by ascetic commoners. As they developed, Waldensian views gradually became systematized. They opposed ecumenical councils, engaged in private interpretation of scripture, forbade clergy interference in their activities, and so on, leading the church to condemn them as heretics. According to a 1320 report by a French inquisitor, specific Waldensian tenets included: denying papal authority; rejecting sacraments other than the Eucharist and confession; emphasizing the New Testament, observing only Sundays, Marian feasts, and the Lord's Prayer, while disregarding all other church-sanctioned holidays, seasons, and prayers; viewing poverty as salvation and opposing private property; refusing to swear oaths; denying purgatory; and insisting on the use of local vernacular. Waldensianism is traditionally held to have been founded by the wealthy merchant Peter Waldo in 1173, after he renounced his wealth in imitation of the apostles and began preaching in Lyon. Many Catholic clergy followed his example, embracing a life of poverty and missionary work. Between 1175 and 1185, Waldo commissioned a Lyonnais priest to translate the New Testament into the local vernacular. In 1179, Waldo was even invited to meet Pope Alexander III and attended the Third Lateran Council. In 1180, for disobeying the decisions of the Third Lateran Council, particularly the prohibition on private scriptural interpretation, Waldo was expelled from Lyon. Thereafter, the Waldensians became a mobile, secretive group, connecting with local Waldensian covert communities for prayer before moving on to the next location. The public church's response to this blatant challenge culminated in the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which formally condemned the Waldensians as heretics. Earlier, in 1121, the burning of 80 Waldensians in Strasbourg had initiated centuries of persecution against the sect. Despite prolonged oppression, the Waldensians never vanished. The failures of the Albigensian Crusade and the Crusade of Varna, the stagnation of the Reconquista, and the success of the Hussite movement all symbolized the gradual decline of the Catholic world. During this period of waning papal authority, the Waldensians expanded, achieving significant growth within France."

#Bogomilism
EDG_Bogomili:0 "Bogomil"
EDG_Bogomili_religion:0 "Bogomil"
EDG_Bogomili_religion_desc:0 "Bogomilism is considered a Gnostic religion founded by the Bulgarian priest Bogomil during the reign of Tsar Peter I of the First Bulgarian Empire. It called for a return to early Christian teachings, rejecting ecclesiastical hierarchy and resisting local rulers and the church. Advocating a dualistic view where God is spirit and Satan is matter, believers held that the world is divided into inner and outer realms. They did not build churches or use crosses, believing the body itself to be a temple, and practiced purification through fasting, dance, or ceremonies. In reality, many Bogomil writings have been lost, and records about them largely come from the works of Zigabenos Zigabenos, with their doctrines continuously altered over time. The earliest records of Bogomilism appear in letters from the Bulgarian Patriarchal Theological School to Tsar Peter I. Some researchers believe Bogomilism absorbed ideas from wandering Armenian Paulicians and Marcionism. Despite continuous suppression by the Orthodox Church, Bogomilism spread across the Balkans. Local churches in Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary successively declared Bogomilism a heresy, with the Hungarians even launching the Bosnian Crusade in the name of eradicating the Bogomil heresy, leading to the eventual emergence of the Bosnian Church. According to Inquisition investigations, a dualistic sect did exist in Bosnia in the late 15th century, though it was not the Bosnian Church. Despite facing enemies on all sides, Bogomilism remained popular. Even after the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire and under oppression from various forces, Bogomilism persisted.

EDG_Celtic_Church_religion:0 "Insular Catholic"
EDG_Celtic_Church_religion_desc:0 "Generally, Insular Christianity is considered a localized Catholic denomination in Ireland. In the 19th century, many forcibly labeled it as the 'Celtic Church,' separating it from the Roman Catholic Church, but historians and believers prefer to call it 'Isolated Christianity.' The history of Insular Christianity dates back to English Christians in the 1st and 2nd centuries. After the Saxons invaded Britain in the 5th century, local Christians were forced to flee to Cornwall, Wales, and Brittany. Over the next century, Christian influence in England waned, but Wales entered the 'Age of Saints,' where Christianity flourished under the leadership of exiles. Brittany followed suit, though Cornwall’s exact conversion timeline remains unclear due to scant records. Saint Patrick and Saint Finnian took up the unfinished work of Bishop Palladius and traveled to Ireland. Saint Patrick’s activities in Ireland can be described as a race against death. Captured by Gaels at sixteen, he spent six years as a slave, during which he converted to Christianity and vowed to bring salvation to the land. After escaping to England and studying in Europe, he returned to Ireland to fulfill his promise. There, he competed with local druids, traveling widely and preaching to nobles. It is said Saint Patrick baptized thousands in his lifetime. For a long time after Ireland’s Christianization, isolated from the chaos of continental Europe, local Christian art flourished and in turn supported missionary work in Scotland. Insular Christianity generally adopted Catholic systems and doctrines but was more tolerant in many aspects, such as opposing church authority and papal supremacy, greater acceptance of women, closeness to nature, and incorporation of Celtic polytheistic elements. Insular Christianity opposed authoritarianism but not the Pope or the church itself. Like other regions in Europe, they respected Rome, opposed the Pope’s secular authority, but acknowledged his spiritual status. Regarding clergy, Insular Christianity particularly emphasized monasticism, using the strict Rule of Saint Columbanus instead of the Rule of Saint Benedict to manage monks. Local diocesan leaders were not bishops but abbots of monasteries; some even argue that in Ireland, monasteries had replaced churches in function. Another characteristic of Insular Christianity is its 'conservatism.' Many practices adhered to Old Testament traditions, such as the calculation of Easter dates and extensive use of Hebrew. In Scotland, Insular Christianity even exhibited practices resembling pork taboos, leading to frequent accusations of Judaization against its clergy in the early Middle Ages."

The church was led by a bishop called a Djed and had a twelve-member council known as Strojnik. The most famous work of the Bosnian Church is the Hval's Codex from 1404, entirely written in Bosnian Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts, serving as crucial material for the study of the Glagolitic language. The theological symbols in the manuscript differ significantly from those of the Orthodox Church. The emergence of the Bosnian Church is dramatic. Since Christianity spread to the Balkans in the 9th century, Illyria has occupied an awkward position. As the border region between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, northern Croatia and Dalmatia fell under Roman jurisdiction, while the southern Serbian area was under Constantinople's influence. Bosnia, sandwiched between them, was nominally managed by the Catholic Church. However, due to weak local ecclesiastical organization and harsh geographical conditions, Catholic influence could not expand further here. Following the East-West Schism, Bosnia became a vacuum rather than the envisioned convergence point for both factions, creating an opportunity for more heterodox sects to rise. In 1252, Pope Innocent IV's assignment of the Bosnian diocese to Hungary angered Bosnian Christians. The 1225 Bosnian Crusade had subjected locals to suffering under Hungarian invaders, leading Bosnians to reject Hungarian appointments, sever ties with Rome, and establish an autonomous church, marking the formal birth of the Bosnian Church. Due to the power vacuum among Balkan states, the Bosnian Church persisted for a long time."

From then on, the Eastern Church took charge of Assyrian Christians and answered to the Shahanshah of the Sassanian Empire. Due to its unique ties with the Sassanian Empire, the Eastern Church gradually drifted apart from the Eastern Roman Christian Church. In 424, Bishop Dadyeshu even declared the rejection of external theological debate outcomes, and the Eastern Church did not send representatives to subsequent ecumenical councils. However, it affirmed doctrines such as Christ's divinity from the First Council of Nicaea.

EDG_Lollards_religion_desc:0 "The Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe in late medieval England. This derogatory term originates from Middle Dutch, meaning 'mutterer' or 'mumbler,' and was earlier applied to European groups suspected of heresy. In 14th-century England, the Church was the largest feudal ruling class, owning approximately one-third of the land. It exploited English peasants through rents and labor services, and also extorted the faithful through heavy taxes and the sale of counterfeit relics. The corruption, decay, and shameless extortion of the Catholic Church not only deepened public hatred toward the clergy but also fueled national consciousness, pushing the anti-clerical sentiment long present in English society into a new phase in the 14th century. The conflict between royal authority and the papacy intensified. Throughout the 14th century, Parliament passed a series of statutes opposing papal interference in English domestic affairs. Meanwhile, the nobility, the lower gentry, and the emerging urban bourgeoisie increasingly found common ground, harboring envy and resentment toward abbots living corrupt lives and wielding state power. Clearly, the old feudal theological worldview could no longer satisfy this new generation. The common people at the bottom, oppressed both by the Church and secular authorities, were the most inclined to join such anti-clerical movements. In the 14th century, the English theologian John Wycliffe launched a fierce offensive against the Roman Catholic Church, marking the beginning of the European Reformation. As the reform deepened, Wycliffe's ecclesiastical reforms gained strong support from knights, commoners, and the emerging bourgeoisie. Driven by the needs of their own classes, they enthusiastically engaged in this religious reform movement, and these individuals were contemptuously labeled 'Lollards'—so-called heretics. The first Lollards centered around Wycliffe's colleagues at Oxford University, led by Nicholas of Hereford. In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury pressured some Oxford Lollards to renounce their views, but the sect continued to expand. A Lollard uprising in 1414 was swiftly suppressed by the King of England; the rebellion was met with brutal reprisals. However, due to the overall decline and turmoil within the Catholic world, this uprising did not mark the end of Lollard public political influence. Increasing numbers of commoners and preachers began to openly or secretly embrace Lollardy, gradually moving beyond the control of English rulers."

EDG_Euchites_religion_desc:0 "The Euchites are a sect that emerged around 370 AD, mentioned by the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople. It is said that their leader, named Peter, claimed to be Christ. He was sentenced to stoning for blasphemy, and before his execution, he told his followers that three days later he would ascend to heaven in the form of a wolf from his tomb. The core doctrine of the Euchites reflects a unique hedonistic philosophy. They assert that the Trinity is perceived through physical desire, that God transformed Himself into matter to unite with perfect spirit, and that God manifests His existence through different perceptions. They believe that human perfection is achieved solely through prayer rather than sacraments. According to some studies, this may derive from the libertine ideas of certain early Gnostic sects. Based on the account of Michael Psellos, the Euchites engaged in revelries and even acts that violated moral norms to some extent. By 1444, however, such behavior was considered localized rather than a defining characteristic of the Euchites as a whole. The Euchites persisted for centuries, maintaining contact with the Bogomils, the Bosnian Church, the Beguine movement, and the Cathars. Due to the spread of the Black Death, the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, and the ensuing turmoil in the Catholic world, the Euchites—who shared many similarities with the Cathars—quickly spread throughout the German regions. Many from the lower classes, suffering under immense social pressure, and members of the upper classes indulging in hedonism, were drawn to this sect that advocated for human liberation. Many German lords also believed that allowing the increase of Euchite followers could help populate their territories. Meanwhile, facing the challenges posed by the spread of Cathars and Waldensians, the Roman Curia and other bishops set aside dealing with the Euchites, a sect that did not openly advocate overthrowing oppression or breaking away from the Roman Church. Consequently, the Euchites developed extensively in secret with little obstruction, though the crisis they would bring would emerge by the mid-15th century."
