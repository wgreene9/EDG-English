EDG_LIT_mission_1_2_desc:0 "In Lithuania, the most revered is naturally our legitimate Grand Duke of Lithuania. But when it comes to the best reputation, none can surpass High Duke Casimir Jagiellon. Renowned for his bravery and martial prowess, this duke has just reclaimed the long-lost Podlasie region from the ruins of the Kingdom of Poland. The Jagiellon family in Vilnius has become one of the most influential noble houses. However, since ancient times, excessive merit overshadowing the sovereign has never been an empty saying. Lithuania must make a decision."

Those people from foreign lands cannot simply be scattered like seeds on the wilderness and left to grow on their own. Among the countless residents speaking different languages and holding different customs, a firm arbiter is needed. We urgently need to establish a more efficient management system. Vadatmas is a Lithuanian term referring to peasants whose social status lies between laukininkai (free peasants) and serfs. This was a form of land tenure in early Lithuanian serfdom."

The August Constitution introduced several modifications to the organization and authority of the Parliament. Simultaneously, the August Constitution represents the commitment and vision of us Lithuanians for the newly conquered territories in Scandinavia. In this land, we are not merely conquerors, but also builders and peacemakers. The Constitution ensures the rights and dignity of every individual, regardless of background or ethnicity. We integrate cultures and values into the legal system to ensure future generations can continue to enjoy this beautiful land. All who come to Lithuania are Lithuanians.

Whenever the smoke of battle spreads over this ancient land, the roar of cannons echoes like the wrath of gods, shaking the soul of every person. When artillery fire blankets enemy positions, its devastating force seems capable of making the very earth tremble. The artillerymen are the true masters of this land.

They need not only living space but also the population of Rus'. Lithuania is ambitious; in its vision, the demographic resources of the Rus' are a crucial component, indispensable for supporting its great-power aspirations. Thus, the Lithuanians actively plan how to attract, assimilate, and integrate the Rus' population to achieve dominion and control over Eastern Europe. Behind this grand blueprint lies a Lithuania discontent with the present, aspiring to become the master of the Eastern European plains. For this, they will spare no effort and stop at nothing."

Meanwhile, the mobs of Smolensk have exhausted the city's former glory and splendor.

But these Novgorodians control the trade routes to the Northern Sea. Lithuanian goods, whether entering or leaving, are often squeezed dry of their last drop of surplus value by them.

It is hard to imagine these Tatars were once the direct descendants of one of history's greatest conquerors. If the Mongols have forgotten who the greatest conqueror is, we can now help them recall how the Khwarezmian Empire was drowned beneath waves of cavalry."

On one hand, they are undoubtedly Europa's finest light cavalry—before the Cossacks' lances, sabers, and steeds, any infantry is sent to hell with skill and elegance. But at the same time, the Cossacks are also the most undisciplined of men, often disregarding military orders for the lure of plunder. The newly enacted Registered Cossack system requires Cossacks to register on the ruler's rolls, allowing the government to control their scope of activity and numbers. This means they must obey government commands and assignments, participate in government-organized military campaigns, and pay taxes. Simultaneously, the government will grant them certain military and administrative privileges to encourage them to serve the Empire's interests."

Whether in maintaining domestic security or participating in international peacekeeping and stability operations, the Standing Foreign Legion plays a vital role.

By reviewing and adjusting the internal organizational structure, communication procedures, and chain of command, the Lithuanian military is committed to establishing a more efficient and unified command system.

Quarterly Troops refer to those levied for military service only during specific seasons each year (typically summer), primarily responsible for the defense of border areas and patrol duties. Annual Troops, on the other hand, are in a state of military service year-round, tasked with broader military missions and combat operations. The establishment of the Quarterly Troops system allows the Lithuanian government to effectively utilize the human resources of the frontier regions and promptly respond to security threats along the borders. It also provides frontier inhabitants with an opportunity to participate in national security affairs, enhancing their sense of belonging and responsibility towards the state."

For the Grand Duke of Lithuania, reclaiming Volhynia is not just about territorial expansion; it is also about driving a wedge between Poland and Rus', opening the path for southern campaigns.

In the fractured lands of Eastern Europe, Lithuania's rise became a bright spot on the historical stage.

Amidst the fires of civil war, Moscow has suffered great wounds; her defenses totter, her people's hearts are scattered, and disorder reigns. In this chaotic land, the Lithuanians see an opportunity for conquest. Their ambitions soar high, determined to seize control of this city. Thus, in the light of dawn, Lithuania's warriors raise their battle standards and march to the field. They carry passion in their hearts, dreaming of toppling Moscow's walls and drawing her into their embrace. Their swords gleam with resolute light, their shields guard fearless conviction. Before them lies the path to glory and victory, the birth of a great nation, a new chapter for the lands of Eastern Europe.

In their vision, the cities of the West will bow to Lithuanian rule, and the states of the Holy Roman Empire will swear fealty. This is a magnificent campaign.

This phenomenon stems from Lithuania's long and diverse religious history, as well as its pre-Christian pagan traditions. Although Lithuania formally accepted Christianity in the late 14th century, traces of folk beliefs persist to this day. In the lives of many Lithuanians, Catholic doctrine intertwines with traditional pagan beliefs, forming a unique religious and cultural landscape. For example, during certain religious festivals and rituals, people may participate in both Catholic sacraments and traditional pagan ceremonies to seek divine protection and favor. This vacillating attitude towards faith reflects the Lithuanians' inclusivity and openness towards religion, as well as their cherishing and preservation of traditional culture. In such a religious environment, the Lithuanian people retain memories and respect for the past while also embracing the new faith brought by Christianity, resulting in a distinct and multifaceted religious character."
