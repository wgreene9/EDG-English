mission_TBR_1_1_desc:0 ""Qara Qoyunlu" — the Black Sheep tribe aspires to expand its realm. Looking in all directions, we are surrounded by formidable foes. Where there is unity, there is strength. The time has come to rally the Turkomans once more. We must rebuild our armies and awaken the courage and resilience in the hearts of our people. The call to muster echoes across the land — arise, Black Sheep tribe! After the cataclysm, reunite under a single banner once again, heed the Shah's call, sharpen your blades and prepare your steeds to compose the song of fate."

mission_TBR_1_3_title:0 "National Reorganization"
mission_TBR_1_3_desc:0 "At their zenith, the Ottoman Turks developed a highly sophisticated system for state governance and military affairs. In this regard, our semi-tribal state is evidently lagging behind. Therefore, some Anatolian Beys who have submitted to us have suggested adopting various Ottoman institutions to reorganize our state's government."

mission_TBR_1_4_title:0 "Slaughter of the Apostles"
mission_TBR_1_4_desc:0 "Decades ago, the Nakharar of Cilicia, defeated by the Crusaders, fled in disarray to the mountains of Yerevan, groveling before the Black Sheep tribe for protection. Yet now, while the Shah was away on campaign, they treacherously slit the throats of Persian caravans to fund their armies, even using the bricks from Black Sheep border watchtowers to build the altars of Yerevan's churches. When the news reached Tabriz that night, Jahan Shah crushed a crystal glass in his hand: "I will make the traitor's blood bind these shards back together!"\n\nThus, the Turkoman cavalry flowed like lava past Lake Sevan, arrows stormed against the walls of Yerevan like a downpour, captured Armenian nobles were bound to the mouths of bronze cannons, their flesh and blood sacrificed as cannon-fodder, and the frescoes of the Apostolic churches were inlaid with the blood of the Hayastanis.\n\nFinally, the Shah ordered wild pomegranates to be brought from the Sassoun valley — the fruit of life trusted by the descendants of the rebel king. These bastards were forced to their knees, made to gulp down the pomegranate seeds whole without chewing, until they choked to death in extreme agony."

mission_TBR_1_6_title:0 "Uzun Hasan"
mission_TBR_1_6_desc:0 "That son of a shepherd named Uzun Hasan is nothing but a hyena in wolf's skin on the Anatolian plains! The blood flowing in his veins is not the noble Grey Wolf blood of Turkic aristocracy, but the mud of lowly, wandering tribes. By licking the boots of Byzantine remnants and hawking his own sister's dowry to Venetian merchants, he barely scraped together a motley army, yet dares to usurp the title 'Sultan of the Aq Qoyunlu'?\n\nHis so-called 'elite' troops are merely a rabble pieced together from Kurdish bandits, Greek mercenaries, and Persian runaway slaves, whose warhorses are so starved their ribs show. In siege warfare, he drives women and children before him as human shields; in retreat, he burns wheat fields to cripple the people's livelihood — such vile tactics would be spat upon even by the jester of my court!\n\nI swear by the Twelve Imams, when we capture Diyarbakir, Uzun Hasan's head will hang from the city gates — let vultures peck away his cunning, let wind and sand grind down his ambition, so that future generations will forever remember the authority of the Black Sheep!"

mission_TBR_1_9_title:0 "The Caesar of Rûm"
mission_TBR_1_9_desc:0 "From Oghuz Khan to Jahan Shah, from the Sultans of Rûm to the Shahs of the Black Sheep, the blood of Turkic nobility has never been diluted.\n\nThe surging Grey Wolf blood of the Altai courses through the veins of Turkoman conquerors. The blood of the Ottoman upstarts has watered the red carpet of the Caesar's coronation. A monarch bearing the pure blood of the twenty-four tribes of the Oghuz now stands where the Seljuks once fell, drawing his bow, gripping his reins, his sword pointing towards Europe:\n\n— By the Mandate of Heaven!"

mission_TBR_1_10_title:0 "The Scourge of God"
mission_TBR_1_10_desc:0 "The King of Kings' iron hooves trampled the snows of the Balkan Mountains. The silver armor of the Magyars melted into teardrops in the phosphorescent flames. The feathers of the Polish Winged Hussars turned to tinder. The iron crosses of the Teutonic Knights were forged into horseshoes. The false Pope's triple tiara was shattered into three pieces: one filled into the walls of Istanbul, one melted into copper lamps for the shrines of Karbala, and the last cast into the Shah's own stirrup.\n\nThe old era now remains only as a dim afterglow. The Turkic lash has carved its mark deep into the spine of Christendom — this scar far surpasses those left by Hulagu and Jochi."

mission_TBR_2_2_desc:0 "A ruler's court is more than just a symbol of sovereignty; it is the crucible of wisdom and decision-making that shapes an empire's destiny. We must strive to build a court that gathers the wisest minds from across our realm. They shall become the Shah's Hammer / the Khan's Hand. Their sage counsel, scholarly wisdom, and diplomatic prowess will guide our governance and ensure that our decisions reflect the needs and aspirations of our people."

mission_TBR_2_4_desc:0 "The heretical Shirvanshah is nothing but a mere clown. As an inferior Turkmen, he could only grovel between the Mongol Khan's court, the blades of Christians, and the hadiths of the Imams.\n\nOnly the most intense flame can refine variegated metal into pure gold; only the most ruthless conqueror can unite scattered sands into a divine mountain. The greatest of all Turkomans—Jahan Shah—thus seized the lands of the Shirvanshah, drank the wine of Azerbaijan from his skull, and melted the throne of the Shirvan alliance into the scepter of the Black Sheep Khan."

mission_TBR_2_5_title:0 "Vengeance on Vakhtang" # Vengeance against Vakhtang
mission_TBR_2_5_desc:0 "The bloody battle of Akhaltsikhe in 1444 ultimately left Tabriz plundered by the Georgian King Vakhtang IV. With fortune turning against them, the Black Sheep could only temporarily restrain their ambitions and bide their time.\n\nNow, the great Jahan Shah has returned. He has forged the shame of his people into a poisoned blade. While Vakhtang IV drank mead at his Christmas feast, the Turkoman cavalry quietly moved out, delivering a fatal blow to the Kartvelians. On that day, the skyline of Tbilisi crumbled in orange-red flames, as if the Day of Judgment for the infidels had arrived.\n\nAfter the city fell, three hundred captives were herded into the church courtyard by Black Sheep warriors. These Georgian nobles were forced to swallow fragments of molten church bells (cast from the very spoils of 1444), their agonized screams harmonizing with the lingering echoes of the bells. Finally, Jahan Shah replaced the bell ropes with the vertebrae of Vakhtang IV: "Now, let your own king personally toll the death knell for your land!"

mission_TBR_2_8_title:0 "The Battle of Erzincan"
mission_TBR_2_8_desc:0 "The Black Sheep army, led personally by Jahan Shah, deployed on the Bashkent Heights along the upper Euphrates. Their right flank was shielded by the swift river, and their left leaned against steep mountains, forcing the Ottoman forces to assault the narrow valley head-on. As night fell, Black Sheep light cavalry lit campfires beyond the Ottoman camp, creating the illusion of a large army gathering, while scouts were dispatched to sever Ottoman supply lines. Although Mehmed II saw through some of the ruse, his commanders were weary from days of marching, and the soldiers trembled at the sight of the Black Sheep's ram banner flying atop the heights.\n\nAt dawn, the Ottoman Sipahis launched the first charge, attempting to tear open the Black Sheep's left flank. However, the Black Sheep's armored cavalry, clad in full plate and armed with lances and scimitars, had lain in ambush in the mountain's shadow. Descending like a 'moving iron wall' from the flank, they deflected the arrows of the Ottoman Azaps with their armor, their iron hooves crushing the front shield formations and driving the Sipahi cavalry back into the muddy riverbanks. A fleeing Ottoman officer cried out, 'They are not men, but devils forged of iron!'\n\nThe Ottoman center used wagons as barricades, deploying arquebuses and small cannons in an attempt to suppress the Black Sheep charge with firepower. Yet, Jahan Shah had anticipated this tactic. He ordered light cavalry to fire arrows wrapped in oil-soaked cloth, setting the wooden structures of the wagons ablaze. Amidst smoke and flames, the Ottoman firearm positions fell into chaos. Black Sheep archers seized the moment to rain arrows from the heights, pinning down the Janissaries trying to reform their lines.\n\nBy noon, the Ottoman right flank attempted to outflank the Black Sheep by circling the mountains, but mistakenly entered the soft sand along the riverbank. The Black Sheep light cavalry feigned retreat, luring the enemy into a pre-set trap. Suddenly, upstream dams were breached, and the floodwaters of the Euphrates poured down, swallowing thousands of Ottoman soldiers. Mehmed II's center was forced to retreat, its formation in complete disarray. Jahan Shah personally led his armored cavalry straight for the Ottoman command banner, engaging the Sultan's guard in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the chaos, a Black Sheep commander severed the standard, shattering Ottoman morale entirely. Mehmed II fled back to Amasya with only a remnant of his force. The great battle, known as the Battle of Erzincan, utterly ended Ottoman ambitions of eastern expansion and proclaimed to the world the hegemony of the Black Sheep Khan in the Turkic world."
