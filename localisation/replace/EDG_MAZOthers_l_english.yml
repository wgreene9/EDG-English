EDG_POL_Sarmatism:0 "Sarmatism"
EDG_POL_Sarmatism_desc:0 "The name and culture of Sarmatism can be seen in modern Polish literary works such as the memoirs of Jan Chryzostom Pasek or the poetry of Wacław Potocki. The nobility wore robes trimmed with fur (zupans) and thigh-high boots, and carried sabers; growing beards was also popular. The 'Sarmatian' image they aspired to was that of an ideal horseman, enjoying equal rights ('noble democracy'), appearing invincible to foreigners. Sarmatism glorified past victories of the Polish military and required the Polish nobility to uphold this tradition. An inseparable piece of their festive attire was the saber known as a 'karabela'.\n\nJan Długosz, a 15th-century Polish chronicler, was the first scholar to link prehistoric Poland with the Sarmatians. His theory was also supported by other historians and chroniclers such as Marcin Bielski, Marcin Kromer, and Maciej Miechowita. Other Europeans' views on Polish Sarmatism primarily came from Miechowita's work, which, through extensive documentation on the territories and peoples of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in internationally circulating languages, attracted readers in Southern Europe. The name derived from the supposed ancestors of the nobility, the Sarmatians. They were actually a tribal confederation of Iranian peoples north of the Black Sea, described by the 5th-century BC Greek historian Herodotus as descendants of the Scythians and Amazons, and later replaced by the Goths in the 2nd century AD. After generations of oral tradition, this evolved into the legend that Poles were descendants of the Sauromatae, a martial people from Asia who later migrated to Southeastern Europe. According to tradition, the Sarmatians were descendants of Japheth, son of Noah."
EDG_POL_winged_cavalry_reform:0 "Winged Hussar Reforms"
EDG_POL_winged_cavalry_reform_desc:0 "Shortly after the mid-16th century, most Winged Hussars had evolved into heavily armed warriors, but this heavy equipment and ornamentation in turn hampered their mobility. Just as it seemed the Winged Hussars would follow the outdated heavy knights into obsolescence, Stephen Báthory, Prince of Transylvania elected King of Poland in 1576, conducted profound and effective reforms of the Polish army. The result of Báthory's reforms of the Winged Hussar units was the creation of a new army that was significantly more agile and mobile while maintaining high discipline. In terms of equipment, he permanently discarded the old-style heavy helmets, wooden shields, and large medieval knightly saddles, replacing them with light helmets of the 'zischägge' type (or other styles) with lobster-tailed neck guards and a single nasal bar across the brim, chainmail and light cuirasses worn over them, or simply cuirasses with chainmail sleeves, specialized saddles and stirrups with strong Eastern influences, and long-necked spurs. The saber remained the primary melee weapon, but now Winged Hussars often also carried a heavy war sword, similar to the Western European estoc, strapped beside the saddle, which was very effective during charges. Two wheellock pistols or a wheellock carbine were carried in holsters in front of the saddle. War hammers and maces remained favored weapons among officers. The length of the lances was shortened, with long pennons attached to the front. During a charge, the sight of countless fluttering, brightly colored pennons was both magnificent and terrifying to the enemy."
