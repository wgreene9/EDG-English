EDG_TTS_mission_1_1_title:0 "Our Path"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_1_desc:0 ""I can do no other. Here I stand." When Martin Luther was questioned at the Diet of Worms, he resolutely spoke these words. Our people should also be able to choose their own path for themselves, for God, and for our people."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_2_title:0 "Securing the Pearl"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_2_desc:0 "Napoli is the largest city in all of Southern Italy. Since the 11th century, Napoli has long been held by the Principality of Capua. For the sake of our hegemony across all of Southern Italy, we should first seize Napoli, and then use it as a center to expand our sphere of influence to the surrounding areas."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_4_title:0 "Controlling the Norman Nobles" # Controlling the Norman Nobility
EDG_TTS_mission_1_4_desc:0 "Since the early 12th century, when the Normans established their first foothold in Sicily and gradually gained control over Southern Italy, the Norman nobility has held considerable influence in our country. We must control the Norman nobility for our own use, whether through forceful or gentle means."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_5_title:0 "The Italian Renaissance"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_5_desc:0 "The Renaissance first emerged in Italy in the 14th century, subsequently spreading rapidly to various city-states across Italy. We should ride this favorable wind, boarding the fast train of culture to better prepare for our influence in Europe and advancements in technology and invention, thereby enhancing our nation's soft power."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_6_title:0 "A Glorious Court"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_6_desc:0 "Our court culture was once obscure, but now, our splendid court is renowned throughout Southern Italy, even all of Europe. Everyone knows this is a land of civilization; all lords gazing upon the treasures here should feel ashamed of their own."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_8_title:0 "Invading Liguria"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_8_desc:0 "The Liguria region is a vital transportation hub for Italy, both in terms of land and sea routes. By controlling the Liguria region and the Ligurian Sea, we can open pathways to Corsica and Sardinia, as well as Provence, laying the foundation for our unification."

EDG_TTS_mission_1_9_title:0 "The Alpine Defense Line"
EDG_TTS_mission_1_9_desc:0 "By fortifying the strongholds on the western side of the Alps, we can defend against incursions by the Cathar heretics. This will better consolidate our borders and prepare us for an opportune moment to purge them. The moment they show the slightest negligence will be our time to strike."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_1_title:0 "The Norman Royal Army"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_1_desc:0 "Over three hundred years have passed since the first Norman King conquered and ruled Southern Italy. Our armies must not be confined merely to this tiny land; we must advance. Army of the Norman King, subjects under Norman rule, strive together for the unification of Southern Italy."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_2_title:0 "Legacy of the "Fox""
EDG_TTS_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Robert "the Fox," Duke of Apulia, began as merely a Norman mercenary, leading a few hundred of his clansmen to Southern Italy to establish a foundation. Through a series of military adventures and speculative actions, he successfully gained a foothold in Southern Italy, becoming the Duke of Apulia, and thus laid the foundation for centuries of Norman presence in the region. Now, we should remember our forebears and set our sights on all of Southern Italy."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_3_title:0 "Unifying the Norman States"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_3_desc:0 "With our complete unification of the Neapolitan region, we now fully control all the lands north of Sicily that once belonged to the former Kingdoms of Sicily and Apulia. We should crown ourselves as King, and the next step is to return to our loyal Sicily."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_4_title:0 "Power in the Shadows"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Though the Mafia is always involved in illicit dealings, their power, hidden in the shadows and the underbelly of society, should not be underestimated. Regardless, to better control our lower classes, we must either cooperate with them for mutual benefit or, alternatively, suppress them by any means necessary to prevent them from becoming a threat to the monarchy."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_5_title:0 "The Future of the Mafia"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_5_desc:0 "The Mafia, once a dark hand lurking in every shadow of Southern Italy, tightly gripping the underworld, has now undergone a dramatic transformation. This great hand has been replaced by another form. The one controlling it has changed from the leader of a criminal syndicate to the King. Like a climber atop a hill, he now overlooks all of Southern Italy."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_6_title:0 "Administrative System Reform"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_6_desc:0 "Our early administrative system lacked clear division of labor, typically relying on temporary bureaucrats appointed based on the King's personal preferences to handle affairs, with no proper distinction between matters of different levels. We should reform our political system to promote standardized governance."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_7_title:0 "Italian Ambition"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_7_desc:0 "Italia has not been unified since the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 553. Now, as we have gained control over all of Southern Italy, we should set our sights on the entire Italian peninsula. Italia must be unified, and the only way is for us to achieve this unification."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_8_title:0 "Invasion of Tuscany"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_8_desc:0 "The Tuscany region lies in the very heart of Italia and is also the southernmost territory of the Holy Roman Empire. If we can unify this region, we will open a path to Northern Italy, thereby aiding our further encroachment upon the Italian portions of the Holy Roman Empire."

EDG_TTS_mission_2_10_title:0 "Games with the Franks" # The Game with the Frankish King
EDG_TTS_mission_2_10_desc:0 "With the unification of all Italy under our belt, we should turn our gaze westward—towards the Franks, our natural geopolitical rivals. Southern Francia boasts fertile plantations, reason enough for them to be wary of us, and for us to covet their lands."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_2_title:0 "Ruling the Mountains"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The Duchy of Calabria fell into Norman hands during the time of Roger II. Today, it stands as one of the core territories of the Norman Kingdom in Southern Italy. By controlling Calabria, we can secure the vital route to Sicily and command the Strait of Messina."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_3_title:0 "Calabrian Pottery"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_3_desc:0 "Calabria has been historically renowned for its abundant pottery. Due to its advantageous geographical location at the northeastern end of the Strait of Messina and its excellent natural harbors, we can integrate the local pottery industry into foreign trade. We should promote the scaling up and industrialization of the local pottery industry."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_4_title:0 "Kingdom of Trinacria"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_4_desc:0 "The term 'Trinacria' means 'triangle' in Italian. Sicily has this nickname due to its roughly triangular shape. With our control over the entire island of Sicily and Southern Italy, we can crown ourselves King of Sicily, just as Roger II did in the past. We are the sole ruler of Sicily."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_5_title:0 "Trinacrian Parliament"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_5_desc:0 "In the past, the power of our state was held solely by the King. There were always edicts issued or enforced based merely on the King's personal whims. Now, with the Parliament's checks on the King, he too must issue decrees within a reasonable and lawful framework, thereby stabilizing the nation."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_6_title:0 "Constitutional Supremacy" # Supremacy of the Constitution
EDG_TTS_mission_3_6_desc:0 "Our nation has always been governed by laws since ancient times, but the content of these laws has been overly scattered and complex, greatly hindering legal revision and judicial processes. We should promulgate a complete 'Constitution of Trinacria' to unify the fragmented laws and clarify the meaning of legal statutes."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_8_title:0 "Invasion of the Papal States"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_8_desc:0 "'When our great army arrived beneath the walls of Rome, the Pope's vile nature was revealed in its full glory. The Pope was never God's representative on earth, willing to live or die with Rome. In fact, the Pope groveled, asking if he could trade the lives of all in Rome for his own freedom. The army's commander unhesitatingly struck off his head.' — Giuseppe Rossi"

EDG_TTS_mission_3_9_title:0 "Iron Crown of Lombardy" # The Iron Crown of Lombardy
EDG_TTS_mission_3_9_desc:0 "With our capture of Milan—the former capital of the Kingdom of Lombardy—we can rightfully and legally proclaim to the world that we have become the true successor to the Kingdom of Lombardy. We should don the Iron Crown of Lombardy and declare ourselves the sole legitimate ruler of Northern Italy."

EDG_TTS_mission_3_11_title:0 "Roger's Dream"
EDG_TTS_mission_3_11_desc:0 "During the lifetime of the great King Roger II, at his peak, he once led his armies to the Alps to openly confront Emperor Lothair of the Holy Roman Empire. After his death, all this glory faded away. Now, we have fulfilled Roger's dream of unifying all Italy, and we have once again deployed our grand army before the Emperor."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_1_title:0 "The Southern Italian Fleet"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_1_desc:0 "'The Trojans departed Sicily; Juno saw it and hastily bade Aeolus loose all his winds, raising a great storm. Neptune was disturbed, and finding his beloved Trojans threatened by the towering waves, he himself subdued the raging winds and sea, calming the waters once more.' Sicily is the throat of the Mediterranean, the queen of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas, Neptune's proudest station. Every town faces the sea, every Sicilian child is connected by blood to the ocean. A powerful fleet not only aids our mastery of 'Our Sea' but is also a battle standard marching towards the lands across the water."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_2_title:0 "Challenge the Lord Protector" # Challenging the Lord Protector
EDG_TTS_mission_4_2_desc:0 "Every kingdom has its king, except Sicily. On this side of Cape Faro, there is no king; on the other side of Cape Faro, the king is not a king. Sicily is the last stronghold of the Angelos dynasty. Their dynasty has already collapsed in Greece and lingers on merely as a breath in Sicily. The true ruler of Sicily is a powerful minister, a usurper. Yet those upstart warlords, like monkeys wearing crowns, adorn their folly with the title 'Lord Protector.' The Catholics in the mountains of Sicily eagerly await a true ruler for Sicily to open the road to Rome, urgently awaiting our saving hand."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_3_title:0 "Cleansing the Greek Heresy"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_3_desc:0 "Upon the ruins of the Byzantine Empire, the once philosopher-filled land of Greece has become a chessboard for competing warlords. Under the shadow of the Turks, multitudes of Greeks crossed the Strait of Otranto to Sicily, the first colony of the Roman Empire, clinging to the last gasp of their empire. The coastline of Sicily is now populated only by Greek speakers, while Catholic nobles have been driven into the mountains. They are called 'Montanari'—the true masters of Sicily. Now that Sicily has returned to the hands of Saint Peter's disciples, it is time to let these Greeks, clinging stubbornly to the past, know that their empire has crumbled. Sicily upholds the true faith of Rome with two hands: one holding the Latin Bible, the other wielding the sword that intimidates heretics."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_4_title:0 "Sicilian Textiles"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_4_desc:0 "Silk production, established as an economic pillar during Muslim rule over Sicily, was diligently maintained by Norman counts and the then Kings of Sicily. Silk production survived alongside technologies like irrigation and land use. Entering the 12th century, silk continued to flow along the central Mediterranean trade routes. Now, Sicily's silk-producing regions belong to us. The mulberry fields are Sicily's gold mine."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_5_title:0 "Revising the Civic Duty Laws"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_5_desc:0 "The flourishing prosperity of the Sicilian textile industry has made Palermo and Syracuse rivals to Venice and Genoa. The rise of Southern Italy is now an irresistible historical tide. In contrast, the speed of the Sicilian Kingdom's civic economic ascent is enough to make all Europe view Sicily with new respect. However, Sicily's outdated civil code and chaotic tax system hinder the citizens' channels for expression. The people of Sicily eagerly await new civic duty laws to replace the old code filled with the vague, archaic language of the Roman Empire era."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_6_title:0 "Industrialize Sicily" # Sicilian Industrialization
EDG_TTS_mission_4_6_desc:0 "Sicily's development is constrained by factors such as its natural environment and geographical location, preventing it from adopting a large-scale, centralized industrial development model like other European nations. Instead, the Sicilian approach to industrialization employs decentralized, flexible, adaptable, and low-cost small-scale factories, along with the traditional methods of cooperatives, to drive industrial progress. These small factories and cooperatives cater to local markets, adapt to changing demands, and mutually reinforce local agricultural production."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_7_title:0 "Right Hand of the Romans" # The Right Hand of the Romans
EDG_TTS_mission_4_7_desc:0 "'The army and navy are the two hands of the state' — this holds especially true for Italy at the heart of the Mediterranean. In Italy, there is no town that does not face the sea, no child who has not seen the ocean, and no reason to neglect the navy. The waves of the Mediterranean are the pulse of the Sicilian people, that azure sea surface akin to their deep, searching eyes."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_8_title:0 "Invading Emilia"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_8_desc:0 "North from Abruzzo lies Emilia, a fragment of Italy divided among Lombardy, Venice, and a few minor principalities. It could be said that Emilia is merely a geographical concept, yet it is also a power vacuum among the northern factions. The Pope, the Lombard Prince-Electors, and the Duke of Venice have turned Emilia into their chessboard. Would they welcome Sicily as a new player in this game? We shall use our swords to inform the local lords that surrendering the lands of Emilia is the greatest mercy they can receive."

EDG_TTS_mission_4_10_title:0 "Knocking on Ragusa's Door"
EDG_TTS_mission_4_10_desc:0 "The city-state of Ragusa is, in a sense, the only polity in the Adriatic Sea that can rival Venice. If we can seize this crucial trading hub, we will gain control over the entire Adriatic trade. Simultaneously, it serves as a bridgehead for our advance into the Balkan Peninsula."

EDG_TTS_mission_5_4_title:0 "A Modern Military" # Modern Military Reforms
EDG_TTS_mission_5_4_desc:0 "Glorious Sicily requires two strong hands: one is an army unmatched by ten thousand foes, the other is a brave and fearless navy. Sicily has introduced modern military reforms, such as restructuring military organization and equipment systems, enhancing soldier training and discipline, while also boosting the treatment and welfare of officers and soldiers to motivate them to unleash their maximum combat potential. On the naval front, Sicily has adopted new ship designs and fleet management systems, implementing effective strategies to counter threats and challenges. These measures have strengthened Sicily's national defense, allowing it to emerge prominently in the Mediterranean region and compete with neighboring great powers."

EDG_TTS_mission_5_5_title:0 "Relations with the Holy See"
EDG_TTS_mission_5_5_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, the most powerful figure in Italy is the Pope himself. He not only possesses the territorial capital essential for any secular monarch's foundation but is also the spiritual leader of all Italy, and indeed the entire Catholic world. Friendly relations with the Pope can not only elevate our prestige but, more importantly, leverage the Church's influence to unite the once fragmented Sicily into a cohesive whole."

EDG_TTS_mission_5_6_title:0 "Usurping Control"
EDG_TTS_mission_5_6_desc:0 "Sicily was once synonymous with chaos, but now it is a unified, centralized state where all revere one sovereign. Robert Guiscard's dream of an empire has become reality. At this moment, Rome's meddling increasingly diverges from Sicily's own path of development. Roman control and interference have become more and more inappropriate, as Sicily has embarked on its own course and is no longer a remote backwater obediently following Rome's lead. Sicily needs only one strong leader, who, like Caesar, holds the status of a king returned, and God will grant him the right to sovereignty."

EDG_TTS_mission_5_8_title:0 "Invading Veneto"
EDG_TTS_mission_5_8_desc:0 "The Venetians have long been infamous in Southern Italy. They turned the Adriatic Sea into a purse to be plundered after their ruthless exploitation, with the wealth of Southern Italy flowing ceaselessly northward under the Venetian merchants' exactions. If we cannot defeat Venice's mercenary traders on the commercial field, then the Sicilians will use the methods we know best to teach them a lesson in humility."

EDG_TTS_mission_5_9_title:0 "Dominating the Adriatic"
EDG_TTS_mission_5_9_desc:0 "The arrogant Venetians have finally paid the price for their conceit and defiance. Veneto is now an inseparable part of the Kingdom. We have achieved initial control over the Adriatic Sea, but hostile Venetian remnants have shifted their unloading points across the water. Croatian and Ragusan ports continue to compete with us. Across the sea, if it does not belong to us, it is our enemy."
