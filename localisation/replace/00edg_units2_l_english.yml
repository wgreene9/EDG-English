iranian_cavalry_1_1DESCR:0 "Traditional Iranian local politics are built upon successive local political entities often referred to as 'tribes.' These tribes can be large or small and are arranged in a hierarchical system, with the highest level being the supreme leader of the state. Early Iranian cavalry were primarily drawn from these local tribes, selected for central deployment in warfare."
iranian_cavalry_1_2DESCR:0 "Horse archers are a vital component of Iranian cavalry. Throughout history, as nomadic peoples continuously impacted Iranian culture and civilization, they also brought their military traditions to the Iranians. The horse archers galloping across the Iranian Plateau are an indispensable part of this heritage."
iranian_cavalry_6_1DESCR:0 "The Azerbaijanis have been indigenous to the northern lands of Iran since the distant Achaemenid Empire. They are also an important part of the Iranian nation. Known for their bravery and skill in battle, Azerbaijani cavalry often charge at the forefront, making them one of the mainstays of Iranian cavalry."
iranian_cavalry_10_1DESCR:0 "With the gradual increase in productivity, Azerbaijani shock cavalry received better standardized equipment and more refined training processes. The combat effectiveness of the Azerbaijani shock cavalry was greatly enhanced."
iranian_cavalry_10_2DESCR:0 "Turan is the Persian term for the nomadic peoples of Central Asia. The Turanians have long fought on horseback, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, achieving victory after victory. Since the era of Turkification, Iranians have hired formidable Turanian mercenaries."
iranian_cavalry_14_1DESCR:0 "Traditional Turanian light cavalry often lacked sufficient protection, and the quality of their weapons varied greatly. However, as the nation's production conditions gradually improved, we became capable of equipping Turanian light cavalry with more effective armor and sharper weapons without significantly compromising their mobility."
iranian_cavalry_14_2DESCR:0 "During the 15th and 16th centuries, firearms adopted by the Ottoman Turks from the West began to gradually infiltrate Iran. Various armed forces in the Iranian region also started to introduce arquebuses, attempting to combine them with the high mobility of cavalry."
iranian_cavalry_17_1DESCR:0 "The firing mechanisms of firearms evolved from matchlock to flintlock. For the Iranians, although progress was slow, improvements to their musketeers were gradually implemented. The enhanced Iranian arquebusiers became better suited to the demands of warfare."
iranian_cavalry_17_2DESCR:0 "The people of Khorasan in southern Iran have long been on the front lines of battles against Indians and Turks. Their cavalry is highly flexible, and when they suddenly appear on the enemy's flanks or even from behind, they always deliver unexpected surprises, often leading to a tidal wave of collapse."
iranian_cavalry_23_1DESCR:0 "Khorasani raiding cavalry equipped with more advanced firearms could inflict significant damage to enemy morale and combat effectiveness from a greater distance. Moreover, if the situation turned unfavorable, they could withdraw from the battlefield without engaging directly. This further enhanced their combat capabilities."
iranian_cavalry_23_2DESCR:0 "Afghans, who have long lived in mountainous regions, possess unique insights into complex terrain. Afghan dragoons armed with smoothbore muskets could dismount and fire from unexpected locations before vanishing without a trace."
iranian_cavalry_26_1DESCR:0 "Early dragoons were often simply mounted infantry equipped with firearms. As time progressed, Afghan dragoons began to develop their own unique equipment, and the dragoon as an independent branch became more mature."
iranian_cavalry_26_2DESCR:0 "As line tactics gradually matured in Iran, the Iranians began systematically training light cavalry to meet the needs of warfare. Iranian sabre cavalry is a typical example of this. Wielding large sabres, Iranian sabre cavalry could strike fear into enemy line formations."
iranian_cavalry_28_1DESCR:0 "Improved Iranian sabre cavalry began to adopt more Western-style hussar equipment, such as the distinctive hussar jackets. Through modernized training, the development of Iranian sabre cavalry also became increasingly standardized and systematic."
iranian_cavalry_28_2DESCR:0 "With the gradual increase in Iran's steel production, the expensive cuirassiers began to appear in Iranian cavalry ranks. It can be said that Iranian cavalry of the line era truly reached new heights."

iranian_infantry_30_3:0 "Iranian Mixed Formation Infantry"
iranian_infantry_1_1DESCR:0 "Equipped with pikes, Iranian shock infantry charging in unison can effectively strike the enemy. After all, no one enjoys facing a tide of enemy soldiers bristling like hedgehogs as they surge forward."
iranian_infantry_1_2DESCR:0 "The terrain of the Iranian Plateau and surrounding regions such as Azerbaijan and Afghanistan is rugged, with winding mountain paths. Therefore, mountain infantry are a vital component of Iran's early infantry forces. They can leverage complex terrain to deliver unexpected blows to the enemy."
iranian_infantry_5_1DESCR:0 "The inhabitants of Khorasan often rely on hunting for their daily sustenance, which has honed their exceptional archery skills. Khorasan longbowmen can strike targets with pinpoint accuracy from great distances, delivering terrifying blows to the enemy."
iranian_infantry_5_2DESCR:0 "The Kurds are nomadic tribes within Iran. Their itinerant lifestyle has endowed them with strong fighting spirit and high morale. When Kurdish assault infantry charge, their battle cries alone are enough to strike fear into the hearts of their foes."
iranian_infantry_9_1DESCR:0 "Although traditional Kurdish nomadic forces possess high morale, they often lack proper equipment and unified organization. Through re-equipping and training the Kurdish assault infantry, our army gains significantly enhanced combat effectiveness."
iranian_infantry_9_2DESCR:0 "By at least the early 16th century, Iran already had matchlock musketeers known as 'Tofangchis.' Serving as an excellent supplement to ranged weaponry, Iranian matchlock musketeers could penetrate armor and threaten traditional armies in unconventional ways."
iranian_infantry_12_1DESCR:0 "From the late 16th to early 17th centuries, Iran gradually established a mature standing army system. Musketeers equipped with firearms were integrated into this force. These musketeers were typically recruited from peasants and, after training, could form ranks and deliver volleys."
iranian_infantry_15_1DESCR:0 "After the establishment of Iran's standing army, the Iranians attempted to organize infantry more effectively—forming complex formations for battle. Well-ordered and organized formations could effectively prevent troops from fleeing and enhance their overall combat effectiveness."
iranian_infantry_18_1DESCR:0 "After the Iranians experimented with integrating matchlocks into their formations, they achieved unexpected success. By mixing muskets and pikes, the formations gained effective ranged striking power while ensuring the musketeers were protected from close-quarters attacks."
iranian_infantry_18_2DESCR:0 "After the flintlock mechanism was introduced to Iran, matchlocks were quickly replaced. The higher rate of fire, reduced smoke, and the ability to avoid revealing their position at night made flintlock muskets rapidly become the mainstream. The proportion of muskets in Iranian formations gradually increased, while that of pikes decreased."
iranian_infantry_22_1DESCR:0 "After the bayonet was introduced to Iran, fusilier infantry officially moved away from the protection of pikemen and became an independent combat branch. By forming dense lines, musketeers could maintain powerful firepower while retaining effective resistance against charges."
iranian_infantry_22_2DESCR:0 "Iran's infantry system gradually matured after the 17th-century reforms. The border infantry of Khorasan, serving as guardians of Iran's frontiers, have long been responsible for defense against India. The local troops possess rich combat experience and can effectively strike enemy forces."
iranian_infantry_26_1DESCR:0 "Khorasan border infantry equipped with advanced smoothbore muskets could deliver more powerful firepower against enemies from the East while maintaining their defensive capabilities against cavalry."
iranian_infantry_26_2DESCR:0 "At the height of the smoothbore musket era, Iran began training its own light infantry. The Azerbaijani people, skilled in archery from a young age, could produce soldiers who achieved remarkable accuracy after training, capable of striking targets with precision from great distances."
iranian_infantry_28_1DESCR:0 "Light infantry were initially simply sharpshooters selected from regular smoothbore musketeers. With the development of military equipment, specialized light infantry gear gradually entered the stage of history. Afghan guerrilla infantry could strike enemies more effectively from afar."
iranian_infantry_28_2DESCR:0 "The development of rifled muskets made Iran acutely aware of its military backwardness. Iran's New Army extensively adopted rifled muskets, whose accuracy and firing range were several times greater than those of traditional smoothbore muskets."
iranian_infantry_30_1DESCR:0 "Early rifled muskets had severe loading issues, requiring shooters to hammer bullets into the barrel. After the Minié ball was introduced to Iran, this problem was effectively resolved, greatly increasing the rifle's rate of fire."
iranian_infantry_30_2DESCR:0 "Equipped with the latest rifled muskets, Afghan riflemen saw a significant increase in their effective range. Their light infantry tactics could deliver even more unexpected blows to the enemy."
iranian_infantry_30_3DESCR:0 "In the post-Napoleonic era, Iran began to equip mixed formation infantry. By combining different types of troops, deficiencies in both close and long-range firepower could be effectively addressed, enhancing the combat capabilities of line infantry."

Maghreb_infantry_1_1DESCR:0 "In the early days, the resistance within Berber communities was quite formidable, so their primary garrisons and combat units were Crusaders. Among the most famous were the Crusader Halberdiers, whose halberds could ferociously cleave enemy skulls, instilling terror in their foes."
Maghreb_infantry_5_2DESCR:0 "Sicilian mercenaries were renowned throughout the medieval period—or, as the Arabs would say, infamous. Early Christian communities in North Africa frequently hired nearby Sicilian mercenaries to handle security issues and conduct military operations."
Maghreb_infantry_9_1DESCR:0 "The Copts of Egypt are one of the few groups in Africa who maintained their Christian faith after the rise of Islam. They are also among the few who mastered early firearm technology. Through hiring them, the combat effectiveness of North African Christian regimes was greatly enhanced."
Maghreb_infantry_9_2DESCR:0 "In the early days, when the Berbers still maintained their original tribal governance and their forces lacked training, foreign infantry were a primary source of military strength for Berber Christian regimes. Although expensive, they delivered services reliably and possessed formidable combat capabilities."
Maghreb_infantry_12_1DESCR:0 "The Murjan Corps was the most elite force of the Moorish kings. Recruited from Mozarabic believers in the Iberian region, they underwent the most rigorous training from a young age, making them a match for the Berbers' mercenary armies."
Maghreb_infantry_15_1DESCR:0 "After the Spanish Tercios fought across Europe, they became renowned worldwide. The Moorish and Berber regimes in Iberia and North Africa naturally benefited from their proximity, allowing them to develop their own imitation tercios modeled after the Spanish system."
Maghreb_infantry_18_1DESCR:0 "As firearm units became active in Europe, North Africans also began to adopt this modern equipment. The Algerians, in particular, excelled in this regard. Thanks to their natural harbors, they had better access to advanced technologies, allowing them to master firearm techniques more thoroughly."
Maghreb_infantry_18_2DESCR:0 "In the early days, when the Berbers still maintained their original tribal governance and their forces lacked training, foreign infantry were a primary source of military strength for Berber Christian regimes. Although expensive, they delivered services reliably and possessed formidable combat capabilities."
Maghreb_infantry_23_1DESCR:0 "Line infantry gradually became the mainstream of European military operations in the 17th century. The Moroccans, due to their proximity to Iberia, also developed highly sophisticated tactics for line infantry. Moroccan line infantry thus became a formidable force in North Africa."
Maghreb_infantry_23_2DESCR:0 "Tuareg initially served as an officer under the Moorish kings and later rose to the rank of general in the Coptic Kingdom. He excelled at combining the advantages of mobile light cavalry with well-trained infantry corps, pioneering new phalanx tactics."
Maghreb_infantry_26_1DESCR:0 "To shield themselves from the intense sunlight from the Maghreb to Egypt and the Arabian regions, locals often wore white garments and cloaks, which became synonymous with their light infantry corps."
Maghreb_infantry_28_1DESCR:0 "After the White Corps was established, they gradually shifted their original tactics to utilize the favorable terrain of deserts and arid lands for guerrilla warfare. The White Guerrillas thus became an elusive force in Iberia and North Africa."
Maghreb_infantry_28_2DESCR:0 "To keep up with the tide of modernization, Maghrebi feudal lords established a European-style New Army. Trained in European methods and equipped with advanced weapons, this force gained renown across North Africa."
Maghreb_infantry_30_1DESCR:0 "After the White Corps adopted guerrilla tactics, they still faced issues with slow rifle fire rates and low accuracy. However, with the introduction of rifled muskets, these problems were resolved. The high-precision shots of rifled muskets could easily eliminate enemies from hundreds of meters away."
Maghreb_infantry_30_2DESCR:0 "Following the establishment of the Maghrebi New Army, Maghrebi feudal lords expanded their modernized forces. The Maghrebi Phalanx Corps was thus formed, and the combined operations of multiple branches quickly enhanced its combat effectiveness."


Maghreb_cavalry_1_1DESCR:0 "As Catholicism spread into Iberia and North Africa, the prevalent mercenary culture of Catholicism also took root locally. The Berbers of North Africa, highly skilled in desert warfare and elusive in their movements, saw numerous camel riders begin to serve Catholic powers as mercenaries."
Maghreb_cavalry_1_2DESCR:0 "With the widespread conversion of many Moors to Christianity, their cavalry forces were extensively utilized by Iberian feudal lords. These Moorish horse archers excelled in their unique mounted archery skills, effectively supplementing the mobility gaps in Catholic armies."
Maghreb_cavalry_6_1DESCR:0 "As the pinnacle of European medieval warfare, cataphracts were highly popular from Iberia in the west to Poland in the east. This type of equipment, introduced alongside the spread of Catholicism, was adopted by North African Christian communities, and North African feudal lords also began equipping their forces with these expensive armaments."
Maghreb_cavalry_10_1DESCR:0 "The word 'Jatulan' is an Arabic transliteration of the Italian word for 'jade.' With the widespread dissemination of Christianity in North Africa, a new knightly order, the 'Jatulan Knightly Order,' was established to recruit fervent Berber believers for military campaigns."
Maghreb_cavalry_10_2DESCR:0 "The people of the Maghreb have long survived in the desert. Hussars recruited from the Maghreb are elusive and cunning; they know how to navigate the desert and engage enemies within it. Like a gust of wind, their sabres reach the necks of their foes."
Maghreb_cavalry_14_1DESCR:0 "Butrus was one of the most outstanding generals of the Moorish Kingdom in the late 16th century. He trained an elite unit of mounted arquebusiers and deployed them on the battlefield, achieving remarkable successes."
Maghreb_cavalry_14_2DESCR:0 "Traditional Arab cavalry were often equipped with sabres and employed guerrilla tactics as light melee cavalry. While effective against light infantry in loose formations, these tactics were less effective against infantry squares. By reorganizing them into shock cavalry and adopting European tactics, Arab cavalry could better unleash their potential."
Maghreb_cavalry_17_1DESCR:0 "Jama'ah was a Berber general who equipped his cavalry regiments with new firearms and adopted caracole tactics, making cavalry more adaptable to the warfare of the new era."
Maghreb_cavalry_17_2DESCR:0 "As the predominant group in North Africa, the Berbers have long lived a nomadic lifestyle. Organizing these nomadic troops, training them, and forming them into disciplined units not only leveraged their mastery of horsemanship but also enhanced their cohesion."
Maghreb_cavalry_23_1DESCR:0 "Dragoons are cavalry equipped with firearms, typically moving to their target locations on horseback before dismounting to fight. This advanced tactic, introduced to North Africa from Europe, was gradually adopted by the Berbers. Berber dragoons became a representative force of modern Arab cavalry."
Maghreb_cavalry_26_1DESCR:0 "Early dragoons were typically equipped with long muskets similar to those of infantry, which hindered their mobility on horseback. With the shortening of barrels and the development of specialized dragoon equipment, the combat effectiveness of Berber dragoons was greatly enhanced."
Maghreb_cavalry_28_1DESCR:0 "Cuirassiers, as heavy cavalry, could effectively breach musket squares, causing disruption to formations and morale. As northern Christians developed such tactics, the Berbers naturally kept pace with the times, establishing their own cuirassiers."
