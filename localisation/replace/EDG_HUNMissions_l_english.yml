EDG_HUN_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Since the signing of the Pacta Conventa in 1102, the Kingdom of Croatia has been united with us under a personal union. To secure the legacy of Duke Bela Pišimir firmly in our grasp, we should seek closer integration into a real union or otherwise strengthen the ties between our realms."

EDG_HUN_mission_1_3_title:0 "Preserve Bosnia"
EDG_HUN_mission_1_3_desc:0 "Bosnia's days of maneuvering between Rome and Constantinople are over; its local church shall now be led directly by the Cardinal of Pest. The weak King of Bosnia cannot protect his people from the pillaging Turks, the bellicose Bulgarians, or even the nearby Lord of Herzegovina. Let us preserve them by becoming their rightful sovereign."

EDG_HUN_mission_1_5_title:0 "March into Bulgaria"
EDG_HUN_mission_1_5_desc:0 "The Bulgarian warlords, by oppressing their people in the frenzied wars of recent years, have achieved astonishing successes right under our noses, even arrogantly claiming the laurels of Rome. Yet their conquests are unstable; the shadows of the past still hover over the Balkans, yearning to break free from the Bulgar yoke. The Bulgars have long been a thorn in our side. Let us become the Bulgar-Slayers of a new age, liberate the peoples of the Balkans, and conquer the descendants of Simeon the Great."

Let the unbelievers of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and lands beyond feel the fires of Magyar warfare—a great conquest that will make their petty fortresses tremble. None in the Near East shall oppose us, for we shall establish a mounted empire reigning over the Levant!"

To the fray! Onward, far and nigh!""

EDG_HUN_mission_1_12_title:0 "Found the Black Army"
EDG_HUN_mission_1_12_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Hungary, surrounded by powerful neighbors, has always required a strong military. In past wars, most forces provided by our nobles needed mercenaries to fill the gaps. As professional soldiers, these mercenaries often adapt faster to new weapons and tactics and engage in regular drills. By now, some have served us for many years, yet in peacetime, they resort to banditry for livelihood. Inspired by the writings of Caesar, our King contemplates establishing a permanent mercenary corps. Offering them a stable, permanent income would surely steer them away from plunder, granting us an unprecedentedly mighty and glorious force—provided our treasury can withstand it..."
EDG_HUN_mission_1_13_title:0 "The Black Legion"
EDG_HUN_mission_1_13_desc:0 "The Black Army has become a force recognized throughout the world. Formidable on the battlefield, they strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and have repeatedly safeguarded our independence. We must not halt midway; we must further institutionalize it, ensure its superiority, and make it a source of national pride and an unparalleled military power."

EDG_HUN_mission_2_2_title:0 "Mastering Wallachia"
EDG_HUN_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Since Vlad II of Wallachia ascended the throne, terrifying rumors of him being a vampire have spread throughout the Carpathians. However, these are undoubtedly baseless tales. We cannot allow Wallachia's military frontier to become another's sphere of influence, enabling it to maneuver between us and them. It is time to intervene and put an end to the Draculesti tyranny once and for all, so that the people of Romania may also bask in the glory of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen."

EDG_HUN_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Serbia once built a vast empire after the Battle of Sofia, but now, following the Bulgarian wars, they are hanging by a thread, their glory faded. The crown of Stefan has been tarnished. We should ensure that the descendants of Nemanjić are also illuminated by our radiance, restoring their former strength and opening a new chapter of their power—as princes subject to the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen."

EDG_HUN_mission_2_6_desc:0 "The Turkish marauders have occupied the Balkan Peninsula for far too long; their days of enslaving the Greeks are numbered. It is time to drive them from our southern territories all the way to the Aegean frontier, incorporating the wealthy coastline of Thessaloniki and the valiant people of Macedonia into our kingdom, thereby establishing our Balkan hegemony!"

EDG_HUN_mission_2_9_title:0 "Unify the Faith"
EDG_HUN_mission_2_9_desc:0 "Hungary is home to many of different faiths, where Latin and Greek rites converge, and the influences of Rome and Constantinople clash. As rulers of the Catholic faith, the people of our newly conquered lands are predominantly Orthodox. In any case, we will not allow religious differences to divide our nation. Let us clarify our religious policies and make timely adjustments."

EDG_HUN_mission_2_11_title:0 "Noble Obligations"
EDG_HUN_mission_2_11_desc:0 "Our nation was built on horseback; nobles can only earn merit and promotion through military service. Magyar hunters swept across Europe like the wind, destroying one enemy after another. Let us continue to promote the Magyar martial traditions, constantly encouraging nobles to join the army, forming new military organizations, granting our forces greater power, and bringing utter ruin to all who oppose us!"

The order now requires significant expansion so that its members can contribute substantially to our campaigns against pagans, heretics, and even internal enemies."

EDG_HUN_mission_2_14_title:0 "Towards Pluralism"
EDG_HUN_mission_2_14_desc:0 "Our conquests have brought vast lands inhabited by many different peoples under our rule. Although ethnic diversity has not caused significant trouble so far, the nascent enlightened concept of the nation-state is slowly redefining what constitutes a nation, and a major threat of rebellion against our rule follows. To maintain the integrity of our empire, we must introduce a set of reforms to modernize our government system and ensure that all peoples living under our rule are fully represented and enjoy welfare."

EDG_HUN_mission_3_1_title:0 "Time Waits for No One"
EDG_HUN_mission_3_1_desc:0 "If Bohemia is the jewel of the Holy Roman Empire, then Hungary is the crown guarding that jewel. However, the disastrous Crusade of Varna changed everything. The heir of the great Sigismund fell in battle, and Hungary was severely weakened. The nobles have grown estranged from the Emperor and are no longer willing to be remotely controlled by the court in Prague. Regent János Hunyadi has become the uncrowned king of the Apostolic Kingdom and will eventually part ways with the Empire. The times are calling, the eve of war has arrived. As soon as the great Sigismund passes, we shall usher in our own era. Time waits for no one; the Magyars recognize only power!"

EDG_HUN_mission_3_2_desc:0 "Due to Emperor Sigismund's prolonged absence from Hungary, he had to entrust state affairs to the great nobles, severely damaging Hungary's centralization and causing decades of stagnation, effectively fragmenting the country among the magnates. With our own independence achieved, we must stabilize these great nobles and firmly grasp all the Lands of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen."

EDG_HUN_mission_3_10_desc:0 "Institutions of higher learning are key to achieving great progress. Although we had universities in the past, present-day Hungary lacks institutions of higher education.

To consolidate the hard-won fruits of independence and remain unwavering in the face of any obstacle, the estates system must be reorganized, reforms must be implemented, and a new federation uniting the various lands shall be established."

This land now lies desolate in the aftermath of the Hussite Wars and wars of succession. If we can take up Sigismund's legacy, bring the Bohemian lands under our rule, and be crowned with the Crown of Saint Wenceslas, we can undoubtedly restore her former strength and prosperity, and make our own Crown of Saint Stephen shine even more brilliantly."

If we wish to become a true great power on the European stage, our agriculture must be able to support our growing population and supply our armies.

Yet with the failure in Rumelia, the once mighty Kingdom of Poland has fractured, its former court weakened, Hussite banners rising from the ruins, presumptuous old nobles eyeing the fate of the White Eagle, and dazed princes retreating to their corners.
