EDG_CWN_mission.3.t:0 "The Hue of the Sea"
EDG_CWN_mission.3.d:0 "A defining trait of humanity is the quest and yearning for the unknown. Humanity's dependence on water is so profound. Wherever water flows, humans follow its course. Upon the seas, wherever islands appear, people sail from isle to isle, thus establishing cultural exchanges between land and sea.\nAnd now, a vast, boundless ocean awaits us."
EDG_CWN_mission.3.a:0 "Set sail, until all vanishes into the hue of the sea."
EDG_CWN_mission_3_event_TT:0 "The 'Twilight of Doom' disaster will no longer occur."

EDG_CWN_mission.4.d:0 "To our brethren in distant lands, the war in Britain has ended, and we shall welcome an era of peace.\n\n"Time's fierce wind sweeps across these rain-hued dunes, creating a magnificent vista.

EDG_CWN_mission.9.t:0 "The Anglo-Saxon Yoke"
EDG_CWN_mission.9.d:0 "With all our ports blockaded by the northern British barbarians, our nation's trade has suffered a severe blow. Failed war strategies have driven the fiefs' discontent to its peak, and the feeble royal house is powerless to reverse the decline."

EDG_CWN_twilight.4.t:0 "Overcoming Adversity Together"

EDG_CWN_twilight.4.a:0 "All we can do is leave it to time."
EDG_CWN_twilight.5.t:0 "Rampant Banditry"
EDG_CWN_twilight.5.d:0 "Villagers with no way out have turned to pillaging. The Commonwealth's order is being trampled, and we have no choice."
EDG_CWN_twilight.6.t:0 "Crumbling from Within"

EDG_CWN_twilight.100.t:0 "The Enclosures"
EDG_CWN_twilight.100.d:0 "Sheep farming requires vast tracts of land. The nobility have been driving away the peasants who once rented their land, even tearing down their homes, to enclose the land suitable for grazing. Suddenly, across the Commonwealth, fields can be seen partitioned by wooden fences, hedges, ditches, and walls. The peasants driven from their homes have become homeless vagrants. This is the Enclosure Movement."
EDG_CWN_twilight.100.a:0 "Where have all the people from the fields gone?"

EDG_CWN_twilight.101.t:0 "Sheep Devouring Men"
EDG_CWN_twilight.101.d:0 "Rising wool prices have spurred the landed gentry's demand for grazing land. Minor and mid-level rural landowners, using various means, have encroached on common lands, seized peasant holdings, and vigorously pursued sheep farming.\n\nIn this era of the 'Price Revolution,' the minor and mid-level nobility have been hit the hardest. Their incomes are modest, and with currency devaluation and soaring living costs, their standard of living has plummeted. Under threat of bankruptcy, these lesser nobles have forcibly occupied the peasants' common lands, while the greater nobles, leading bands of demobilized soldiers, openly plunder them. Nearly all newly enclosed lands have been turned into pastures, driving swathes of peasants into towns in search of work. Urban handicraft workshops are momentarily unable to absorb them, leaving the dispossessed peasants destitute and displaced.\n\n'Sheep, once tame and requiring little, have now become greedy and fierce, even seeking to devour men, trampling our fields, homes, and cities.'"
EDG_CWN_twilight.101.a:0 "If we drive the peasants away, who will tend the crops?"
EDG_CWN_twilight.102.t:0 "Noble Discontent"
EDG_CWN_twilight.102.d:0 "To the foolish Lord Consul:\n\nThese lands have been in our possession for generations; the Parliament has no right to interfere. The rights of the nobility are not royal gifts but forged by history! And yet, you treat a thousand-year tradition as scrap paper, tearing it up at will, all to shield those lazy, gluttonous peasants.\n\nYou would rather cling to that pittance of grain tax, like a vulture guarding carrion, than open your eyes to the world! English wool sells across Europe; Flemish merchants kneel with gold coins begging for orders. And you—a blind old rat—wage war upon us to curry favor with those starving wretches! Do you know how much silver the nation loses for every pound of wool rejected?\n\nYou may reject wool, but you cannot reject war! Today's Commonwealth and Parliament are but putrid maggots. Only a King can bring true peace. Usurper, I shall shatter your body, and your soul shall burn in hellfire for eternity!\n\n—A Righteous Man"
EDG_CWN_twilight.102.a:0 "I see no righteous man, only a swarm of flies, brutal as beasts, buzzing about."

EDG_CWN_twilight.103.t:0 "Famine Year"
EDG_CWN_twilight.103.d:0 ""I entered a peasant's cottage, and the sight before me stunned me speechless. Six people, emaciated and spectral from hunger, lay on a heap of filthy straw in a corner of the hut. I thought them dead, but as I drew near, faint groans reached my ears. These 'people' were still alive...""
EDG_CWN_twilight.103.a:0 "We must control the situation."
EDG_CWN_twilight_103_TT:0 "All our provinces producing §YGrain§!, §YFish§!, §YLivestock§!, or §YWool§! gain §R50§! Devastation."
EDG_CWN_twilight_103_a_tt:0 "Unlocks a series of decisions to mitigate the Great Famine's effects. This disaster ends upon completing all §YRelief Effort Decisions§! and the missions §YEnd Manorial System§! and §YAid for Ireland§!."
EDG_CWN_twilight.104.t:0 "Reckoning"
EDG_CWN_twilight.104.d:0 "All nobles who sought to overthrow the Commonwealth have been brought to account. Their heads shall hang high on the gallows, their eyes pecked by crows and their brains washed by rain, until every city brick is soaked with their stench. The Commonwealth will fully seize all lands of the rebellious nobility—manors, pastures, forests, and mines, without exception! The right to raise troops is no longer the sole privilege of the nobility; the Commonwealth will establish a standing army to meet future needs."
EDG_CWN_twilight.104.a:0 "Long live the Commonwealth!"
EDG_CWN_twilight_104_TT:0 "Enables the new 'New Army' estate."
EDG_CWN_twilight.200.t:0 "Rotten at the Core"
EDG_CWN_twilight.200.d:0 "The compounding issues of excessive resource consumption, intensifying trade competition, and unstable trade policies have created immense operational difficulties for our nation's maritime trading enterprises. Problems like reduced orders, declining market share, and shrinking profit margins have led to a sharp decrease in our overseas trade revenue, posing severe challenges to our economic development."
EDG_CWN_twilight.200.a:0 "It's the economy, you fools!"
EDG_CWN_TW_200_TT:0 "Unlocks Economic Reform decisions. Completing all Economic Reforms ends this disaster."
EDG_CWN_twilight.201.t:0 "Soaring Prices"
EDG_CWN_twilight.201.d:0 "Despite our promises to maintain a strong currency, we have no choice but to devalue it. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ gold coins have been abandoned by banks and merchants across nations, their value plummeting wildly."
EDG_CWN_twilight.201.a:0 "We have no other choice."
EDG_CWN_twilight.201.b:0 "We have contingency plans."

EDG_CWN_twilight.202.t:0 "Rampant Smuggling"
EDG_CWN_twilight.202.d:0 "People have discovered numerous ways to evade paying taxes on goods circulation by using secret channels to smuggle them past our authorities. This erodes our revenues, but stopping them would come at a considerable short-term cost."
EDG_CWN_twilight.202.b:0 "We must crack down hard."
EDG_CWN_twilight.203.t:0 "Guilds Refuse Dialogue"
EDG_CWN_twilight.203.d:0 "The existence of guilds ensures price stability in a region and prevents cutthroat competition. However, positions within guilds are inherited as if by birthright, closed off both internally and externally. For townsfolk, guilds are an important safeguard of civic rights, yet for rural artisans and laborers, they are a barrier.\n\nTo break this monopoly, the Commonwealth has engaged in multiple rounds of communication with the guilds, but each ended in discord."
EDG_CWN_twilight.204.t:0 "Profiteering"
EDG_CWN_twilight.204.d:0 "Our administrative officials are clearly a talented lot devoid of virtue. Government operations are indeed running well, but the focus of administrative affairs has begun to shift, gradually leaning towards the interests of the patrons of these important officials.\n\nBribery is slowly becoming the norm in the market, with everything having a clear price tag. Those who refuse bribes have become the living embodiment of the proverb 'a fool'—even more foolish, for they actually turned down money within their grasp."
EDG_CWN_twilight.204.a:0 "Turn a blind eye."
EDG_CWN_twilight.205.t:0 "Regaining Control"
EDG_CWN_twilight.205.d:0 "We have finally managed to break our dependence on the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName], reasserting control over all vital state functions and confining these merchants within the city walls."
EDG_CWN_twilight.205.a:0 "The situation is now fully under control."
EDG_CWN_twilight_205_TT:0 "Each level of our administrative advisor, the Economist, will grant us an additional +5% Goods Produced modifier."
