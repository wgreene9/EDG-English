EDG_MISSION_GSR_1_2_title:0 "A Feast for the Wolves"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_1_2_desc:0 "While the Balkans were embroiled in bloody struggles, the Turkish beys of Anatolia waited in the shadows for their chance to strike, like a pack of wolves eyeing the fate of the Empire. Though we have clashed fiercely with these infidels in the past, in this critical hour of the Empire's life or death, we shall temporarily engage in expedient diplomacy with them, letting them fight the Bulgarians on our behalf to gain a breathing spell."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_1_3_title:0 "Wandering Knight" # The Wandering Knight
EDG_MISSION_GSR_1_3_desc:0 "Even looking back at the Empire's most glorious era over the past century, Vjekoslav Brankovic stands as one of Serbia's most brilliant military stars. Combining strategy and valor, he rendered distinguished service at the Battle of Sofia, yet was ultimately imprisoned for nearly 20 years due to court intrigue. However, his loyalty and achievements will never be forgotten. We shall welcome back this glorious knight, who will rally long-abandoned armies and lead us to victory once more!"

EDG_MISSION_GSR_2_2_title:0 "The Papal State"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_2_2_desc:0 "Across the Adriatic Sea, separated only by a strip of water, lies the 'Papal State' under the Roman Pontiff. We, believers of the Eastern Orthodox Church, are not without friction with them. Yet, at the Empire's most perilous moment, they have extended an olive branch, hoping to expand the Latin Church's influence in the Balkans through us. Maintaining good relations with them can bring us valuable Western aid, while insisting on independence and taking a hardline stance can earn greater support from our Orthodox faithful. Regardless, we shall take the course most beneficial to the Empire."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_2_3_title:0 "Military Consolidation"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_2_3_desc:0 "The Bulgarian War served as a warning to us. In the early stages of the war, the decadent imperial forces struggled against the fierce armies of Bulgaria and Albania, teetering like the fate of the Empire itself. Now, as we have reversed the decline and rebuilt the Empire, it is time for a round of military reform. We must integrate the combat experience gained during the war, so that the Serbian army may once again dominate the battlefields of Eastern Europe."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_1_title:0 "The Darkest Hour"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_1_desc:0 "Since the assassination of the great Emperor Stefan 'the Tall' Lazarevic, Greater Serbia has been plunged into prolonged turmoil. The Grand Župans, with the Emperor's indulgence, usurped great power. The Empire grew increasingly corrupt, with regions enjoying high autonomy, imperial decrees going unheeded, leading to a de facto state of fragmentation. With the 1444 Mount Leš uprising and the Bulgarian rebellion, the Empire has clearly reached its darkest hour. We must promptly reorganize our armies to save the nation from peril."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_3_title:0 "Resist Constantine"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_3_desc:0 "After the triumph at the Battle of Sofia, the Empire liberated its fellow Balkan Christians from Muslim tyranny, earning their allegiance. However, the Bulgarians ultimately fear power rather than cherish virtue. Having regained their statehood through the divine martial prowess of Stefan 'the Tall', they now, under the hawk-eyed and wolf-hearted False Tsar Constantine IV, have turned like a loosed arrow against his successors, sworn to overthrow the Empire's hegemony. No matter what, for the sake of the Empire, we must repay tooth for tooth, blood for blood, and resist the False Tsar."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_4_title:0 "Execute the Tsar"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_4_desc:0 "As the hussars proudly entered the cities of Nikopol and Sofia, planting the imperial banner atop the False Tsar's palace, the fragile Bulgarian nation was once again subdued by Serbia's soaring double-headed eagle. The once-ambitious Constantine IV is now a prisoner trembling with constant fear. We shall bestow no pitiable mercy but choose to execute this chief rebel, intimidating the remaining traitors and formally drawing a close to this farce known as the [Bulgarian War]."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_5_title:0 "The Serbian Era"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_3_5_desc:0 "Emperor Stefan Dušan, a legendary conqueror of his generation, nearly unified the Balkan Peninsula and was crowned sovereign of both the Greeks and South Slavs. However, his sudden death plunged the Empire into fragmentation once more. After crushing the rebellion, reforming the system, and reorganizing the military and administration, Greater Serbia once again stands at the center of the Eastern European stage, proclaiming to the world its legitimacy as the true heir to Stefan's legacy. The Empire will be restored, and must be restored. An era of iron and blood for Serbia shall surely dawn again."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_4_2_title:0 "Unite the Princes"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_4_2_desc:0 "The persistent infighting among the Grand Župans was one of the reasons for the disintegration of Stefan Dušan's empire. To rescue the Empire from peril, we must unite the princes, cede some benefits to ensure their loyalty, reawaken their war obligations to the Empire, and make them continue to provide troops and taxes, securing our defenses and guarding the regions."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_4_4_title:0 "Administrative Reforms"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_4_4_desc:0 "In 1349, Stefan Dušan promulgated the Dušan's Code, modeled on the Eastern Empire's system, which consolidated Serbia's feudal structure. However, under this system, the Grand Župans and the Church held extensive privileges, and the monarch's rule was always constrained by the local princes. This was one of the causes of the Empire's decline. With the conclusion of the Bulgarian War, some old feudal bonds have been torn apart, undoubtedly providing us with an opportunity to reform the imperial administrative system."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_5_2_title:0 "Return of the King"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_5_2_desc:0 "Obilic Nemanjic is the nephew of Emperor Stefan John Uroš. He once led troops to successfully suppress the Skanderbeg rebellion in Albania, achieving illustrious military feats. However, due to the current Emperor's distrust, he has never been given significant responsibilities. Now, as the imperial edifice is on the verge of collapse, we must correct the Emperor's mistake and entrust him with great duties once more. At the same time, considering we hold a Bulgarian prince in our custody, releasing him to sow chaos for the False Tsar might be a wise choice."

EDG_MISSION_GSR_5_3_title:0 "Coronation Agreement"
EDG_MISSION_GSR_5_3_desc:0 "As Obilic returns amid the watchful eyes of the masses to assume the great authority of the Serbian Empire, he must reward the Grand Župans who supported his ascension, allowing them to better fortify Skopje's defenses. Simultaneously, he must prepare to rein them in, ensuring their perpetual loyalty to prevent a recurrence of the previous dynasty's scenario where the nobility grew uncontrollable and the Empire declined."
