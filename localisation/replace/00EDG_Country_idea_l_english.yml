However, the veche continued repressive domestic policies, treating the nation's agriculture and handicrafts as its own colony and exploiting peasants and lower-class artisans to the extreme. This ultimately led to an uprising by freeholders and townspeople. The rebellious peasants and citizens formed an alliance later named the United Front. After overthrowing the merchant veche, the freeholders and citizens established a government that rejected the dictatorship of nobles and property owners, forming a military force known as the National Militia."

He submitted this act to the Assembly of the Land, demanding that the nobility across the realm fulfill their obligations as the military aristocracy. Though Ivan II's life will eventually end, his act shall forever radiate brilliant light over our land, destined one day to allow the wings of the Volhynian Eagle to spread from Kiev to Moscow."
EDG_VOL_2:0 "Reform the Assembly of the Land"
EDG_VOL_2_desc:0 "The old Assembly of the Land has become a cancer upon our state. Powerful nobles refuse to obey the monarch's commands; only wise and virtuous rulers like Ivan II can mobilize the nation's vitality. When the monarch lacks capability, we fall into peril.

This law meticulously defined the powers exercisable by the state and the obligations of citizens, yet faced criticism for not explicitly addressing the corresponding aspects for both parties, leading to its initial limited implementation.

EDG_AZO_2:0 "Civilize the Tatars"

In 1157, the Grand Prince of Kiev Yuri Dolgorukiy granted this land to Yuri Yaroslavich, grandson of his uncle Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, marking the beginning of the principality's independence. In the early 15th century, we once again shook off Lithuanian domination and regained our hard-won independence. Having tasted both freedom and its loss, we understand the imperative to defend our sovereignty."
EDG_TOV_2:0 "Dregovichians and Marshes"
EDG_TOV_2_desc:0 "The Dregovichians were an East Slavic tribe inhabiting the northern regions between the Pripyat River and the right bank of the Dnieper.

EDG_TOV_3:0 "Turov Trade Tax Reform"

EDG_EDG_MLO_1_desc:0 "The Alps form a dividing line within the Holy Roman Empire, separating Latins from Germans. Although the Holy Roman Emperor still holds the titles of King of Burgundy and King of Italy, German control south of the mountains has weakened along with the imperial authority itself. The emperor must appoint the most loyal and reliable Italian prince as the imperial plenipotentiary in Italy - in other words, the 'Viceroy of Italy'. Since the Visconti family seized Milan, they have maintained good relations with the Empire. Regardless of changes in the northern imperial throne, the Duke of Milan remains the undisputed Viceroy of Italy. When the electoral seat of Mainz was transferred to the Milanese archbishopric controlled by the Visconti, none could deny that the Lombard lord, Duke of Milan and Modena, was indeed Italy's foremost prince."
EDG_EDG_MLO_2_desc:0 "The Po Valley boasts thousands of acres of fertile land yielding abundant harvests every golden autumn, yet even such prosperous lands cannot satisfy Lombard thirst for profit. Joining mercenary companies is the path chosen by every Italian youth yearning for glory or seeking fortune on the battlefield. The most exceptional among them become condottieri, gaining the opportunity to raise their own troops. Lombards would rather exchange their grain for a few lire than miss the chance to gather ducats, florins, livres, and dinars from the hands of foreign monarchs."
EDG_EDG_MLO_3_desc:0 "In the Greek era, the Athenian Academy was a harbor of wisdom; during the Arab era, scholars' disciples filled the House of Wisdom. Now, Lombardy stands as the hall of knowledge. In Milan, one can not only hear the teachings of ancient Greek sages and recite the Hippocratic Oath, but also study Avicenna's 'Canon of Medicine'. While the rest of Europe remains in slumber, Lombardy has already turned its curious gaze toward distant horizons. Future generations will recognize Lombardy as the cradle that nurtured the Renaissance."
EDG_EDG_MLO_4_desc:0 "Plato's Athenian Academy, as romanticized by later generations, was considered the ideal form of an institution of knowledge. Under the organization of clergy, scholars were assembled to establish the highest seat of learning for imparting knowledge, resolving doubts, and receiving instruction. The earliest universities more closely resembled what later ages would consider theological seminaries, their primary aim being to produce more educated clergy. However, as students grew dissatisfied with the rigid church schools, a group of scholars from Bologna spontaneously organized to establish the Mother of Modern Universities - the University of Bologna. The Lombard Council of Wisemen welcomed the expansion of universities, issuing a series of decrees in Verona that not only reaffirmed the Imperial Decree of 1158 but also established comprehensive school charters and statutes."
EDG_EDG_MLO_5_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has historically opposed profiting through moneylending. According to classical doctrine, earning through diligent labor was blessed, while exploiting others through usury was akin to consorting with the devil. This doctrine was observed throughout Europe for 400 years, but it first began to erode in Lombardy. Due to the region's commercial prosperity, merchants had far greater capital circulation needs than peasants toiling in fields, creating the most urgent financial demands. Goldsmiths, previously seen merely as gold storers, recognized this opportunity and began lending out deposited gold as capital for profit. As Lombardy's commercial demands and financial networks continuously expanded over time, reaching as far as the British Isles, even people there would refer to any moneylender as a 'Lombard'."
EDG_EDG_MLO_6_desc:0 "The Italian states were born as the frontline in the contest between the Empire and Western powers. The Empire also employed offshore balancing to divide Italian city-states, preventing the emergence of any force capable of challenging German hegemony. Through a combination of co-option and suppression, Italy remained perpetually fragmented. To change Italy's division, the Duke of Lombardy took the lead in forming the Most Holy League, aimed at uniting all of Italy."
EDG_EDG_MLO_7_desc:0 "Guilds were the primary organizational form for commerce and handicrafts in Lombardy at the time. These guilds, typically composed of artisans, merchants, and other practitioners of the same trade, aimed to protect their interests and promote their industry's development. As the economy grew and commercial activities flourished, the scale and influence of these guilds expanded accordingly. Accumulating more capital and resources, guilds began undertaking broader commercial and industrial activities. With increasing organizational scale, human resource management became increasingly important. Guilds started hiring professionals to manage departments for personnel, sales and marketing, finance, and legal affairs. This specialized management structure laid the foundation for the corporate form."

EDG_SIC_1_desc:0 "In 1254, Conrad IV died, and his illegitimate brother Manfred usurped the Sicilian throne from his nephew Conradin. This resulted in Sicily losing all support from Germany, and Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily began to weaken. The Greek communities now became a ticking time bomb within the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1266, through Genoese mediation, Greeks from Messina and Syracuse took up arms. Using the vesper bells of Sicilian churches as their signal, both eastern and western coasts of Sicily swiftly fell to Greek control. The Syracuse Catholic Cathedral was consumed by flames. Prepared for this opportunity, General di Savoy saw the beacon fires and led his forces onto Sicilian shores. Manfred disappeared - some say he hid in a mountain village, others claim he perished in a shipwreck while fleeing Sicily. For the first time since Archimedes' death, Sicily's coastal regions belonged to Greeks again. In 1411, Michael Angelos, a prince of the exiled Epirote dynasty who had become the son-in-law of the Doge of Venice, gained fame in Venice for his diplomatic eloquence and courageous bearing. To counter Genoese influence over Mediterranean trade routes, Michael Angelos led a fleet core of Swiss and Lombard mercenaries to land at Syracuse. Before the landing, his deputy Paolo Nosati infiltrated Sicilian mountains, claiming to be Catholic crusaders coming to rescue locals from Greek control. Sicilian mountain families, believing this, provided detailed maps and garrison information, and after Michael's landing, actively supplied his troops. Yet they were betrayed from the beginning, as Sicily became Angelos dynasty territory. When Emperor Isaakios IV died in 1443, his 9-year-old son Isaakios V succeeded, with real power held by Theodore Vatatzes - a young, capable, and ambitious militarist supported by most military nobles. In November 1443, Theodore gave Isaakios V his ultimate gift: he deposed the young emperor and, with military aristocratic support, became 'Lord Protector' with supreme military and political authority. Theodore established a Protectorate Council composed of military noble commanders, personally appointed by the Lord Protector, to manage regional military and administrative affairs."
EDG_SIC_2_desc:0 "Theodore established a Protectorate Council composed of military noble commanders, personally appointed by the Lord Protector to manage regional military and administrative affairs. Since these central and local officials all originated from military backgrounds, they generally possessed high military competence, and their forces demonstrated considerable combat morale."

The deep ancestral friendship between the Kingdom of Valencia and the Kingdom of Castile facilitated continuous dialogue between Valencian knights and the Order of Calatrava, ensuring both kingdoms maintained exceptional military strength along the religious frontier."
EDG_VAL_2_desc:0 "'The Song of El Cid' (the epic's full title is 'El Poema de Mio Cid'. 'Cid' derives from Arabic, an honorific for men. 'Mio Cid' means 'My Lord' or 'My Master') is the earliest epic in Spanish literary history. Originally a cantar de gesta (song of deeds), its author remains unknown. Some literary historians attribute it to clergy, others to juglares (minstrels). These wandering singers, active during the 12th century, typically lived in poverty, traveling to perform in public squares, taverns, inns, or noble houses. With widespread illiteracy, Spanish commoners eagerly listened to juglares for entertainment and historical knowledge. 'The Song of El Cid' remains the most completely preserved cantar de gesta, generally dated between 1140-1157. The extensive poem spans over 3,700 lines, artistically recounting the life of Rodrigo Ruiz de Vivar across three cantos (songs)."

EDG_BDH_5_desc:0 "On a modest hill stand remnants of a Moorish fortress. Originally a Roman town, later occupied by Moors, the city prospered.

The Derqawi Order was established in the late 18th century by Moulay Arabi Derqawi, with followers distributed across eastern and northern Morocco and western Algeria.

EDG_MJO_2_desc:0 "As early as 1300-1000 BC, people already lived collectively on Mallorca. During the Arab occupation from the 9th to 13th centuries, Mallorca developed significant urban structures. Our isolated geographical location has maintained peace across our lands, making Mallorca a frequent refuge for war-weary migrants from across the western Mediterranean seeking sanctuary and settlement. They cultivated lands and entered urban workplaces, providing developmental opportunities for us."
EDG_MJO_3_desc:0 "During the 13th century, after repeated failed attacks by Catalans and Barcelonans, they bribed the corrupt Catholic curia to excommunicate the Mallorcan king. When the devout king sought forgiveness through submission, domestic nobles overthrew him, establishing what effectively became an aristocratic republic. Yet power transition didn't deter enemy ambitions - the Pope excommunicated Mallorca's ruling nobles, who then abandoned Roman rites for Catalan liturgy, severing ties with the Roman Curia."
EDG_MJO_4_desc:0 "We speak a distinct language from our neighbors and maintain different beliefs. We should bow to no one, and for a maritime power, the best way to preserve independence is naval expansion."
EDG_MJO_5_desc:0 "Our neighbors never abandon their wolfish ambitions - 'surrounded by powerful enemies' perfectly describes our geopolitical situation. Without greater support, maintaining our independence remains challenging."
EDG_MJO_6_desc:0 "New sea routes brought prosperity not only to the Iberian Peninsula but also opportunities for us. New products and cheap slaves provided technical support for establishing fertile haciendas in Mallorca, while domestic and international cities created demand - conditions perfectly suited for the hacienda economy."

While eliminating the Janissary Corps, he also curbed religious influence by suppressing the Bektashi Order, which had close ties to the Janissaries, thus initially clearing the path for reform. Over the subsequent decade, the Sultan implemented a series of reforms: abolished the outdated military fief system, reclaiming most fief lands for the state; eliminated the practice of confiscating criminals' property; established ministries of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance modeled after European governments, temporarily changing the title of Grand Vizier to Prime Minister; created a postal system; conducted a national census; founded military academies; issued official Turkish-language newspapers; and paid some attention to economic issues by establishing committees for agriculture, industry, and commerce. To coordinate reform planning, the Sultan established the Supreme Judicial Council and recalled Ambassador Mustafa Reshid Pasha from Britain to lead the drafting of reform edicts. Mahmud II's reforms served as the prelude to the Tanzimat, preparing the ground for its implementation."

Emir Ibrahim was a bloodthirsty tyrant who delighted in watching prisoners being skinned layer by layer while enjoying wine and entertainment. Worse still, Ibrahim Yaqub imposed relentless taxation upon Lebanon, plunging the people into misery. Muhammad al-Hariri, a Lebanese officer born into common society who understood civilian hardships, had traveled through the Catalan Republic in his youth, gradually developing admiration for republican systems and disdain for autocratic monarchy.

EDG_EGY_2_desc:0 "As progressive rulers, we must excise the cancerous tumor that has plagued Egyptian society for centuries - the Mamluks. These decadent, backward feudal forces not only hinder our advancement but have long served as foreign puppets exploiting the Egyptian people."
EDG_EGY_3_desc:0 "We require comprehensive land reform including: demanding all tax farmers declare their holdings; abolishing the tax farming system and nationalizing tax farmers' lands; confiscating Islamic religious lands under pretexts of mismanagement and lack of documentation. We'll redistribute some confiscated lands to landless or land-poor peasants, enabling cultivation while requiring fixed annual government taxes; consolidating miscellaneous exactions into a single land tax uniformly assessed by the state based on land quality; implementing standardized measurements and national land surveys to significantly increase actual taxable land area. Thus while reducing peasant burdens, we'll boost state revenue, greatly enhancing peasant productivity and national fiscal income."
EDG_EGY_4_desc:0 "We focus on importing technology from Western Europe, purchasing equipment, hiring foreign technicians to train domestic expertise, and absorbing capital, enabling Egyptian national industry to achieve high technical standards and rapid development from inception.

EDG_NOM_1_desc:0 "The core strength of the Aegyptus state government lies with foreign Greeks. These Greek officers seized power in Egypt and established a military junta to maintain their rule."
EDG_NOM_2_desc:0 "Aegyptus primarily operates under a tenant farming system where free peasants are the main producers. They sign contracts with landowners guaranteeing they won't leave the land from sowing to harvest. These contracts contain coercive elements, with terms potentially extended if tenants provide additional guarantees. Greek military settlers often lease their lands to Egyptian farmers. Additionally, peasants can lease royal lands and borrow seeds, tools, draft animals, and sometimes even housing. The government determines crop types, strictly controlled by local officials. This agricultural management meets multiple needs, and properly maintaining this structure's balance benefits agricultural development."
EDG_NOM_3_desc:0 "The Aegyptus government employs an extreme state monopoly system with extensive coverage. State monopolies include not only mining, salt, wine, spices, glass, and pottery but also foreign trade and money-changing activities. This system applies not only to Egypt but all kingdom territories. Tight tax collection and strict monopoly operations enable the kingdom to extract maximum wealth."
EDG_NOM_4_desc:0 "We have established an elite guard composed of ethnic Greeks. This guard is well-trained with doctrinally advanced officers, directly commanded by and accountable to the king."
EDG_NOM_5_desc:0 "Since the Aegyptus government consists of foreigners, many Egyptians resist our foreign culture even when sharing our faith. Thus we require more open, inclusive, and culturally assimilative policies to sustain long-term rule."
EDG_NOM_6_desc:0 "Aegyptus military recruitment draws from various ethnic groups. Initially relying mainly on Greek immigrants who received land in exchange for service, they formed the military majority. As the kingdom engaged in multiple wars, Greek recruitment became increasingly insufficient, with immigration from mainland Greece inadequate for military needs. Since Greeks primarily serve in the royal guard or as officers and officials, we must recruit more locals to expand our forces."
EDG_NOM_7_desc:0 "Due to our lack of popular support during the initial power seizure, we granted regional autonomy to secure emirs' obedience. However, as we gradually strengthen state control, it's time to revoke Muslim governors' privileges."

EDG_COP_7:0 "Integrate the Negades"
EDG_COP_1_desc:0 "Copts take pride in devoutly adhering to the Coptic faith, their psychological state strongly manifested through religious devotion. Christianity entered Egypt through Saint Mark in the mid-2nd century AD, with Egyptians converting en masse to resist polytheistic Roman rulers. When the Roman Empire adopted Christianity in the 4th century, advocating Christ's dual divine-human nature, Egyptian Christians countered by accepting the doctrine of Christ's single composite nature to oppose Roman and Byzantine rulers. They cited Christ's edict: 'Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's,' resisting secular interference in church affairs and maintaining ecclesiastical independence. After the 451 Council of Chalcedon condemned Miaphysitism as heresy, the Egyptian Church decisively broke with Constantinople. Copts long maintained a pattern of widespread dispersion with localized concentration, present nationwide but more numerous in Upper Egypt than Lower Egypt, in urban areas than rural. In cities, they concentrated in specific districts like Cairo's Shubra, Azbakeya, New Cairo, Old Cairo, and Sahel areas; in villages they inhabited distinct quarters. This settlement pattern facilitated mutual connections and religious activities. While Coptic-Muslim intermarriage occurred, internal marriage now predominates. They give children Coptic names, with rural Copts tattooing cross symbols on wrists. These practices express Coptic pride, dignity, and self-preservation. Now we reestablish the authentic Coptic faith as our state religion."
EDG_COP_2_desc:0 "Due to distrust of Christians, Muslim regimes closely monitored local officials' activities. While Coptic officials handled regional tax collection and distribution, the government dispatched Muslim inspectors nationwide to supervise revenue operations and maintain regular central communication. Despite suppression under Muslim rulers, we ultimately formed an influential Coptic aristocratic class. Gaining these families' support will better mobilize national strength."
EDG_COP_3_desc:0 "With Coptic identity inseparable from their faith, Copts passionately champion ancient Egyptian history and culture, convinced that Pharaonic civilization decisively ensured Egypt's continuity. They particularly treasure post-millennial history's first six centuries - when Coptic Christianity formed amid foreign persecution, especially under Emperor Diocletian. For survival, Copts united around their church in inspiring resistance. To commemorate countless courageous martyrs, they designated Diocletian's accession as the Coptic calendar epoch, honoring these six centuries as 'Coptic History,' objecting to official textbooks labeling it 'Egypt under Roman Rule.' With their history, destiny, and fortunes inextricably linked to Egyptian soil, Copts naturally identify with Egypt's essential character with profound emotion."
EDG_COP_4_desc:0 "The Cathedral of Saint Mary, also known as the Hanging Church, is located in Cairo's Old City, the Coptic Quarter. It earned the name 'Hanging Church' because it was constructed above the southern gate of former city walls, though not literally suspended in midair. The Hanging Church stands as arguably the most beautiful among all churches here. Its snow-white towers and exquisite crosses against the azure sky radiate the unique sanctity and brilliance of Christian churches. Under sunlight, plants in the church garden appear to glow with an incredible light, filling hearts with profound emotion. Inside, the black altar furnishings, ivory-inlaid screens, and marble pulpit reflect meticulous craftsmanship. The interior arrangement features a small altar supported by 13 pillars symbolizing Jesus's apostles - one made of black basalt representing Judas who betrayed Jesus. The church also preserves numerous saintly relics, with the Virgin Mary's icon being most renowned."
EDG_COP_5_desc:0 "Ancient Egypt's military administration evolved continuously. State military affairs were centralized, enabling pharaohs to effectively mobilize national resources for campaigns. During the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, Egypt established a specialized institution called the 'Armory Bureau' managing weapons, weapon/ship manufacturing, military supplies, and fortifications. Its director, the 'Armory Bureau Chief,' sometimes combined with army scribal duties, held crucial military department positions. This represented the ancient world's earliest central-level military logistics organization. We have reinstated the Armory Bureau, though its functions now include introducing new military doctrines and advanced equipment."
EDG_COP_6_desc:0 "The Coptic Church serves as the religious institution sustaining the Coptic Christian community. Whether in urban or rural areas, Christian communities typically cluster around church buildings. For individual Christians, the local church forms the central institution around which they organize their lives according to its liturgical schedules and activities. Local churches provide gathering spaces for worship and spiritual guidance while functioning as charitable and educational establishments - essential components of Christian life. Another vital religious institution is the monastery. Monasteries offer spiritual anchorage for monks while serving as workplaces, learning centers, and even refuges. They remain equally important for ordinary Copts, possessing extensive rural lands and engaging in commercial transactions with surrounding settlements, constituting crucial production and circulation nodes in Egyptian Christians' economic life."
EDG_COP_7_desc:0 "Negades originally meant 'lower classes,' belonging to the lower freemen stratum, emerging around the late Old Kingdom. After the Coptic state's establishment, they evolved into a bourgeois 'Negades' class, including so-called 'powerful Negades.' Some powerful Negades owned lands, hiring agricultural laborers to manage their farms. The Negades' growth marks a significant indicator of Coptic modern capitalist economic development."

After Władysław III's death, the already unstable Poland effectively fragmented into three states, including Sandomierz.

EDG_FRK_1_desc:0 "Seven centuries ago, when Charlemagne received the papal crown, a new empire seemed to dawn on the horizon. The Eternal City Rome's world-center status appeared destined for Aachen, Europe poised for 'Pax Francorum.' Though except for southeastern remnants of the old empire, all European civilization bowed to the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne, the nascent dawn plunged back into eternal night as the empire fragmented into dark ages. But a new Frankish ruler's rise now illuminates Europe with past glory - his every breath stirs storms along the Loire and Rhine. He is undoubtedly Europa's master: as heaven has one sun, Europa has one sovereign."
EDG_FRK_2_desc:0 "Despite enduring taunts from Empress Irene's subordinates, north of Rome in Alemannia, Lombardy, and Gaul, the title 'King of the Romans' rightfully belongs to the great Frankish Empire, not the usurper Otto I and his descendants. Since the disciplined, mighty, obedient Roman legions praised in all accolades were replaced by successive Germanic mercenaries, the Roman legion seemed merely a carved stone concept rather than actual troops. Roman legions flourished with the empire's rise - the empire's resurgence will birth new legions. The Frankish Emperor's guard embodies Roman discipline, Greek wisdom, Gallic courage, and crucially, Frankish conquest thirst."
EDG_FRK_3_desc:0 "The Frankish Empire stands where mountains meet sea - Northern Europa's crossroads from Lusitania to Zeeland, Caledonia to Lombardy. Frankia is the world's new center. The Pyrenees, Alps, and Rhine provide natural barriers for the Frankish core, but Frankish territory long transcended geographical constraints. Its central location offers a natural platform for projecting influence. A Frankish court intellectual termed their strategic concept 'Grand Strategy' - focusing on maintaining Frankish hegemony while fostering balance and suspicion among foreign nations. Continental courts pride themselves on fluent Frankish, Frankish diplomats spreading imperial will through salons and banquets. Frankia represents civilization's center and nations' leader: 'Let all pride themselves in Frankish friendship, unconsciously accepting Frankish hegemony.'"
EDG_FRK_4_desc:0 "When Jesus was born, the Star of Bethlehem guided the Three Magi to the Virgin Mary. These wise men came to worship Jesus because he came to save all humanity, not merely to fulfill Jehovah's covenant with the Jews. For the subsequent millennium, the Catholic Church maintained universal construction principles - all Catholics worldwide venerate the Roman tiara, while Caesar's states remained fragmented. They call themselves Lowlanders, Germans, Normans, and Occitans. Yet just as Egyptians, Greeks, Etruscans, and Carthaginians became Romans, they too can become Franks. God is universal, never rejecting conversion based on origin. Frankia is universal - those who cultivate, labor, and govern upon Frankish soil are all Franks."
EDG_FRK_5_desc:0 "Frankia wasn't the first maritime power - our southern neighbors have extracted endless gold and silver from the Spice Islands and New World. Yet this doesn't mean Europa's leader would ignore such wealth. Greeks considered Mount Atlas the world's edge, most Vikings never reached or knew lands west of Greenland. But Frankish ambition extends beyond European domination - beyond the Old World, Frankish fleurs-de-lis shall bloom across every conquered land. Not being first doesn't prevent Frankia from having the last laugh."
EDG_FRK_6_desc:0 "Otto I and his fraudulent successors smugly cling to the crown stolen from the Franks, brazenly claiming equality with Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, Diocletian, and Charlemagne before the world. They treat the exalted title 'King of the Romans' as a child's plaything. In Alemannic lands, the emperor is but a figurehead - territorial lords and knights act autonomously, carving fiefdoms where imperial authority seems derived not from the emperor himself but from imperial possessions. How can such fragmentation constitute an empire? The title, born of theft, lacks sanctity; teeming with vermin, it cannot be Roman; with authority scorned, it hardly qualifies as empire. Frankia's mission is to shred this paper crown and place the true diadem upon the legitimate monarch."
EDG_FRK_7_desc:0 "A knight can personally ride his steed around his fiefdom twice between sunrise and sunset; a count can visit every township under his jurisdiction within months. But for a Frankish emperor ruling countless knights and hundreds of counts, personal management of his domains proves nearly impossible. The Frankish emperor ingeniously established rotating officials distinct from Roman governors and contemporary counts/dukes - these inspectors tour Frankish lands, answer directly to the emperor, with treasurers and tax collectors submitting separate accounts for imperial audit. Additionally, permanent court archival and administrative departments were established, centralizing economic authority under the imperial government with annual review records and documentation, significantly enhancing Frankish administrative capacity."

Bordering numerous Catholic territories, we face constant threats from both the Duke of Lombardy and the Pope, who eagerly seek to breach our borders and undermine Piedmontese independence. Only by building a powerful army can we resist their aggression."
EDG_PIT_2_desc:0 "Southern Piedmont features gently rolling hills where farmers cultivate grapes. Benefiting from mild climate and fertile soil, Piedmont early became one of Italy's primary wine regions. The most renowned Piedmontese wine is 'Barbera' - a robust red wine perfectly paired with beef."
EDG_PIT_3_desc:0 "Piedmontese culture remains relatively young. Historically, this entire region was broadly termed 'Western Lombardy.' Piedmont actively distinguishes itself from Lombards, transforming numerous areas into Piedmontese cultural spheres. Ethnically, some regions host French communities like Aosta and Savoy, while eastern Piedmont exhibits stronger Lombard characteristics. Cultural fusion represents an ongoing drama continuously unfolding across Piedmont."
EDG_PIT_4_desc:0 "Piedmont has always maintained strong interest in technology and science. While other Italian regions focused on philosophy and art, Turin's rulers patronized young chemists and engineers, establishing Piedmont as a technological hub. This rationale prompted creating a new educational institution: the Polytechnic - where engineers, technicians, and architects could acquire knowledge."
EDG_PIT_5_desc:0 "Columba's monastery at Bobbio gained increasing prestige throughout the Middle Ages, particularly as it became a Catholic bulwark against Arianism. Bobbio Abbey accumulated an invaluable library with a scriptorium producing manuscripts coveted across the continent. These intellectual institutions made Bobbio northern Italy's cultural and knowledge center for centuries, its scriptorium becoming Italy's largest book production site."
EDG_PIT_6_desc:0 "Piedmont stands alone in Italy by maintaining a standing army while other states employ mercenaries. Piedmont conscripts peasants for military service - these unfortunate individuals are selected for years of mandatory duty away from home. Initially deeply unpopular, this system ultimately became the Savoyard army's successful principle."
EDG_PIT_7_desc:0 "Military service transformed Piedmontese mentality: once peaceful farmers became disciplined soldiers. Every Piedmontese knows he's also a soldier. When France invades, youths automatically flee to mountains fighting for king and country without requiring generals' guidance. This explains why Italian uses 'Piedmontese soldier' describing exceptionally dutiful individuals."

Though merely 22, his military prowess and discernment already earned renown. Nasir unified Yemen by 1356, gradually expanding through regional conquests. He entered Arabian political struggles, filling power vacuums. The loosely organized Sahadan rule permitted substantial local autonomy, facilitating rapid expansion. By 1374, Nasir I had become a regional power controlling nearly half the Arabian Peninsula. In 1380, when the last Bahri Mamluk Sultan Hajji II was expelled from Cairo, the Burji faction failed to consolidate control, triggering a Mamluk civil war that devastated Egypt's economy. Sultan Hajji II sought Sahadan assistance, promising southwestern Arabian territories and substantial tribute to Grand Malik Nasir I. After deliberation, the 60-year-old Nasir recognized this as Allah's ultimate birthday gift, marching into Egypt. After suppressing the rebellion for the Bahri Sultan, Nasir turned against the Bahri regime, ultimately replacing the Mamluks as Egypt's Sultan, reestablishing a powerful realm spanning Egypt and Arabia."
EDG_FYM_2_desc:0 "The imperial military-administrative system rests upon feudal relationships between Egyptian Mamluks and Arabian tribal confederations.

Securing Egyptian Mamluk support constitutes every Sahadan Sultan's primary task upon accession."
EDG_FYM_4_desc:0 "To safeguard various domestic factions' interests and maintain support for the Sahada Dynasty, Sultan Nasir I promulgated the Buhayra Act in 1390.

Abolishing the Buhayra Act will be our first step toward building a centralized state."

EDG_CDC_1_desc:0 "The initial Crusades aimed to reclaim Jerusalem and the Levant, nominally for redemption but practically serving as knights' career platform. Yet successive crusades drifted farther from Jerusalem, while Stephen of Clois's absurd 'French Crusade' launched on dubious divine revelation unexpectedly took root in Carthage. Since the Second Albigensian Crusade's failure, crusading lost appeal for many knights - merely collecting Muslim heads along Tunisian borders sufficed for boasting of valor. But for French families settled since Stephen's crusade, Tunisia bears deep crusader imprints. The Kingdom of Tunisia and neighboring Knights Templar form Christianity's North African bridgehead, witnessing that great trans-Christian conquest."
EDG_CDC_2_desc:0 "Flandreau was the crusader flagship's name, the sole vessel surviving that campaign by transporting Stephen of Clois back to Tunis, thus escaping Muslim raid on Alexandria. Today, this ship's only remnants are its nameplate hanging on Tunis's water gate and a shanty titled 'Flandreau Advances':\n'Distant horns sound in the wind/Flandreau advances/Blue seas stretch beneath our feet/We march courageously forward/Heave, heave, the ship sails on/Unafraid of storms or waves/With faith we sail afar/Flandreau never retreats...'"
EDG_CDC_3_desc:0 "As Christendom's largest African stronghold, Tunis serves as Mediterranean East-West trade hub. Here, goods from Gabès and Constantinople exchange hands; Malian and Oriental gold flows as taxes. Barbary pirates naturally target such rich prey, prompting regular Tunisian Strait patrols against corsairs. When encountering Muslim vessels, captains never mind extra levies, while recovered pirate plunder certainly needs no returning."
EDG_CDC_4_desc:0 "Though parting ways with the Knights Templar, Tunisian rulers retained valuable lessons. For the nascent Kingdom, primary concern was distributing conquered lands. In Europa, local governance was largely outsourced to clergy - Catholic peasants obeyed priests willingly, but hostile Berbers remained unconstrained. Thus besides directly-administered Tunis, arable lands were divided by lineage and military merit into various-sized fiefs granted directly to knights owing allegiance solely to the king, not subordinate lords. Knightly families and retainers served as territory contractors, displacing Berbers while Catholic farmers would overcome heretical Berbers. As long as male lineages continued, these lands differed little from European holdings, but territories reverted to the crown without male heirs."
EDG_CDC_5_desc:0 "In 1302, the Tunisian Order of Saint Cyprian was established. The name Cyprian derives from a great Carthaginian bishop, Tunisia's patron saint. As 3rd-century Carthage's bishop, Cyprian crucially advanced Christianity there. A devout believer, he propagated Christian doctrine and values while actively organizing congregational and charitable activities. His extensive influence made him the region's spiritual guide and patron saint. Under his leadership, Carthage's Christian community flourished, with believers contributing to church development and spreading faith nearby. The Order's founding commemorates and continues Bishop Cyprian's dedication and mission. Comprising devout Christians, the Order protects regional Christian faith and values, aiding the vulnerable and persecuted. Named after Cyprian, it perpetuates his example guiding members' conduct and spiritual pursuits. Through sworn oaths, knights defend justice, uphold truth, and engage in philanthropy, continuing Cyprian's legacy."

Without reforming existing ecclesiastical structures, our institutions will gradually become obsolete and abandoned. Church reform has become urgent - we must reorganize domestic Catholic institutions and seek more reasonable coexistence with the Pope."
EDG_CDC_7_desc:0 "Crusading appeals have lost their former attraction, with many viewing crusades as mere political/military stunts rather than paths to salvation. This mentality doesn't exist in our Crusader Kingdom - every Christian resident receives rigorous ideological education from childhood, instilling crusading and holy war as fundamental principles."

EDG_YRK_2_desc:0 "During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, York was depicted as prosperous. Periodic religious festivals and performances related to Corpus Christi filled the streets, attracting increasing numbers of entertainers. Prominent figures like Old Nicholas Blackburn - a nobleman serving as mayor in 1412 and business leader - had his image carved on the eastern window of All Saints' Church on North Street."
EDG_YRK_3_desc:0 "Since castles were built along the Ouse River, York gradually became an important city and administrative center of Yorkshire. The establishment of an archbishopric here created a secondary administrative authority rivaling royal government by the late 13th and 14th centuries."
EDG_YRK_4_desc:0 "York also served as a significant trade hub. After the Norman Conquest, several religious structures were erected including St Mary's Abbey and Holy Trinity Priory. The city became royal demesne with sheriffs providing substantial protection for the Jewish community."
EDG_YRK_5_desc:0 "During the late Middle Ages, York reached its zenith reflected in its architectural environment. York Minster stands as England's largest medieval cathedral and one of Europe's greatest Gothic churches. The medieval walls and gates known as 'Bars' encircling the city remain visible today."
EDG_YRK_6_desc:0 "Ouse River flooding perpetually threatens York with inundation. The city maintains extensive though not always effective flood control networks including walls along the Ouse, embankments across the Foss, and reserved floodplain areas within city limits - creating unusually abundant green spaces for this reason."
EDG_YRK_7_desc:0 "The Ouse River banks feature flood-nourished meadows while low-lying areas surrounding the city border marshes. Another similar area called 'Knavesmire' serves as recreation ground when dry in summer, with cattle grazing there."

EDG_NFK_2_desc:0 "The Magna Carta, or Great Charter, stands among England's crucial constitutional documents from the feudal era. On June 15, 1215, King John of the Plantagenet dynasty was compelled to sign under pressure from barons, clergy, knights, and townspeople. This document not only subjected royal power to legal constraints, establishing principles of inviolable private property and personal freedom, but also granted greater autonomy to regional nobles."
EDG_NFK_3_desc:0 "The first Lollards centered around Wycliffe's Oxford colleagues, led by Nicholas of Hereford. In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury forced some Oxford Lollards to recant, yet the movement continued expanding and flourishing particularly in East Anglia."

Provincial governors were appointed from non-Turkmen new army commanders accountable solely to the emperor, gradually replacing Qizilbash as regional controllers.

Abbas's rule marked the Safavid's most crucial period, signaling transition from traditional tribal governance toward autocracy. With imperial support, Caucasian political influence dramatically increased, forming a powerful third force alongside Turkmen and Persians."

Domestically, he receives limited praise, frequently exploiting subjects and nobles for military campaigns.

In military command, Nader had few equals across 18th-century West Asia or globally."

Employing cavalry effectively in rugged terrain proves challenging, yet Kurdish horsemen navigate mountains effortlessly. During the Ilkhanate, the Hazaraspid served as vassals governing barren highlands avoided by Mongol conquerors. When khans abandoned equestrian traditions for Sultaniyeh's comforts during the 1335 imperial collapse, only those controlling the reins survived independently. Successive heirs briefly occupied the Ilkhan throne before being replaced. Though overshadowed by the Chobanids of the Taichiud controlling the northwest and Jalayirids holding fertile lands, the mountain-bound Hazaraspid demonstrated keen legitimacy-seeking instincts. After the Golden Horde sacked Tabriz, the dubious claimant Noshiwan disappeared, prompting Kurds to secretly enthrone former khatun Sati Beg. Despite internal debate about female rulership, Kurdish merchants disguised as traders smuggled Oljeitu's daughter hidden in Persian carpets from the city. Sati Beg entered her fourth marriage following unions with Amir Choban, Arpa Ke'un, and Sulayman Khan. As rival claimants died unnaturally or from illness, Sati Beg became the sole legitimate heir by 1330, reluctantly recognized by factions. After her 1345 death, her son Surgan and descendants continued as puppet khans."

He captured Bukhara in 1500, then defeated the Persian-Timurid coalition under Babur at the Battle of Sar-i Pul near the Zeravshan River in spring 1501. When Samarkand's ruler Ali hastily negotiated, Shaybani executed the ignorant youth, declared the Timurid Dynasty ended, established his own dynasty with Samarkand as capital."
EDG_SHY_3_desc:0 "With Eastern Chagatai Khan Mahmud's assistance, Muhammad Shaybani gathered his grandfather's remnants, conquered Transoxiana between 1500-1510, and founded his dynasty. During this period, his tribesmen merged with Transoxiana's sedentary population, forming the modern Uzbek nation - a powerful, unstoppable people destined for great conquests."
EDG_SHY_4_desc:0 "After conquering Herat, Shaybani immediately implemented measures to restore production. He first addressed land ownership issues and revived cultivation, returning lands to original owners while encouraging reclamation of civil war-abandoned territories. Temporarily unreturned lands were registered under Shaybani Khan, with treasury funds allocated for production restoration, worked by peasants with harvests collected as state taxes."
EDG_SHY_5_desc:0 "Shaybani prioritized repairing irrigation systems. Two years after capturing Bukhara in 1502, the dam bridge across the Zeravshan River was completed, followed by new canals and reservoirs. Numerous irrigation projects emerged along the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, transforming the Fergana Valley into interconnected agricultural oasis kingdoms, restoring and developing Central Asian socioeconomics."

Defeated by nobles, Eric sought burgher support by granting extensive privileges, even promising Scania to Sweden. With Swedish and burgher aid, Eric suppressed rebellion but reneged on ceding Scania, leading Sweden to occupy the region militarily. Losing external support, Eric attempted to reassert royal authority by curtailing burgher powers, sparking the 1439 Burgher Revolt that forced him to grant extensive autonomy to city councils and free cities, effectively dissolving the Danish monarchy into a commercial confederation."

EDG_HAB_ideas_1_desc:0 "The mysterious 'AEIOU' motto, heraldic reliefs on St. George's Church's west wall, and burgeoning medieval chronicle literature collectively affirm one theme - Austria transcends mere geography. This land and its destined rulers are fated to achieve extraordinary accomplishments and witness great history. Indeed, Austria represents not just territory but an inclusive community of destiny encompassing empire, mission, tradition, and providence. While most ruling houses derive names from primary territories like Brandenburg or Saxony, Austria carries an ancient family's enduring faith and hopes beyond geography. For later Habsburg princes assuming foreign thrones, they remain Austrian house members despite distant homelands. Austria's significance for Habsburgs exists not only in present reality but also in historical memory."
EDG_HAB_ideas_2_desc:0 "Legends about Austria and its ruling family's divine mission emerged through Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini's careful crafting. As Emperor Frederick's minister and renowned historian, his early-1440s fictional dialogue promoted Frederick's enlightenment, emphasizing Austrian rulers' sacred duties: defending and spreading imperial authority, restoring Italian order, expanding Christendom, and ensuring public welfare. At the Basel Council years later, Piccolomini again praised Austria's religious devotion to governing by divine will, citing numerous Austrian-born kings and emperors as evidence. He extensively referenced the 'Chronicle of 95 Lords' to provide scholarly basis for fictional genealogies, embellishing the prophesied Habsburg mythos."
EDG_HAB_ideas_3_desc:0 "Maximilian's selection of Innsbruck as treasury location was strategic. Backed by Tyrol's rich silver mines, the central treasury could use future minting revenues as collateral for loans from Augsburg's Fugger and Welser bankers, temporarily alleviating fiscal pressures. Given Innsbruck's political importance, Maximilian ordered additional palace construction: a 'Heraldic Tower' displaying orderly imperial territories' coats of arms, and a loggia overlooking Innsbruck's main square for enjoying tournaments and equestrian events. Today, the loggia's famous 'Golden Roof' with its luxurious gilded copper tiles still proudly watches over Innsbruck's main square through centuries."
EDG_HAB_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Habsburg legend continues through magnificent royal mausoleums and triumphant Roman-style theatrical productions, distinct from previous hollow performances. As Charles V declared at the Diet of Worms, the sacred mission of defending the faith gradually integrated into Habsburg lineage, becoming inseparable from the dynasty's great destiny."
EDG_HAB_ideas_5_desc:0 "Given the Habsburg emperor's vast territories, prolonged absence was inevitable. Ferdinand I delegated Hungarian and Bohemian administration to regency councils handling lower court appeals and petitions. Thus the Privy Council became the sole department coordinating governance. Established in 1527 with no more than twelve advisors constantly accompanying Ferdinand during inspections, Habsburg territories maintained considerable autonomy under local traditions - a principle exemplified by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V."
EDG_HAB_ideas_6_desc:0 "War consumed nearly half of Maria Theresa's reign. Fiscal reforms marked revenue-enhancement measures providing solid foundations for military operations. Following Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz's advice, she increased taxes and bound parliaments through ten-year agreements, eliminating annual bargaining delays while abolishing numerous parliamentary fiscal privileges. When parliaments complained, the Empress responded firmly. To the verbose Carniolan Parliament regarding taxes, she demanded "immediate approval of the following sums." Similarly, when promulgating the 1775 constitution for annexed Polish-Lithuanian territories (grandly renamed Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), she stripped parliamentary tax authority, instructing that when receiving fundraising orders, parliaments shouldn't consider "whether appropriate" but only "how to accomplish.""
EDG_HAB_ideas_7_desc:0 "In 1760, a new 'regional conscription system' modeled on Prussian military service began implementation. New military districts supplied Habsburg forces, with conscription committees and civil officials jointly registering eligible manpower. They first selected economically dispensable males as optimal recruits while deploying recruitment teams. The new system required comprehensive population censuses including livestock available for wartime requisition."

After establishing the Danubian Federation principle, member states' rights and obligations were legally clarified and strengthened.

EDG_H10_ideas_1_desc:0 "During the Empire's early days, the Elbe basin was Slavic territory until emperors established northern marches, bringing governance and civilization. These northern marches eventually evolved into the Electorate of Nordmark, Margraviate of Luppin, and Margraviate of Brandenburg - three northern guardians defending the Empire's northeast frontier and maintaining Holy Roman Empire border stability. Now, the Kingdom of Elbeland has superseded these three northeastern marches, inevitably becoming one of Northern Germany's most formidable forces."
EDG_H10_ideas_2_desc:0 "Before the Habsburgs ascended the throne, various families were elected emperors, with Elbeland territories frequently becoming imperial demesne. Many great rulers used all or parts of Elbeland as power bases, including Otto I of Saxony and Sigismund I of Brandenburg. The Elbe-irrigated lands represent the Empire's past - perhaps someday we too can properly utilize this territory to restore the Holy Roman Empire's former ideals."
EDG_H10_ideas_3_desc:0 "Growing estate power significantly threatens Elbeland's supreme authority. While their contributions are substantial, they endanger our power foundation. The united three estates effectively constrain royal authority - we must systematically counter other estates to consolidate control, necessitating weakening traditional estate privileges. Our reformers believe a Royal Privy Council enables continued benefit from estates without accommodating their demands. Early Hohenzollerns replaced customary with Roman law, then relocated the supreme court from court to fixed location, achieving Brandenburg's judicial reform. We can integrate the Brandenburg margraves' supreme court, manipulating national judiciary and politics through its authority."
EDG_H10_ideas_4_desc:0 "Our banners that intimidate foes inspire our armies to find courage for great deeds, as befits those who never admit defeat. Our lands gather resilient, unyielding peoples - Brandenburgers, Brunswickers, and Hanoverians all form stalwart communities. Elbe valley inhabitants never submit to foreign occupation; however desperate the situation, even facing apparent defeat, our elite forces continue battling enemies, leveraging their skills to regain extensive and profound victories."
EDG_H10_ideas_5_desc:0 "When others attempted to suppress the great reformer Martin Luther, Elbe rulers became renowned for protecting him. All Europe knows we don't stifle unorthodox thought, understanding deeply that stability enables expansion. By encouraging religious tolerance and allowing diverse ideas to flow freely across our lands, we achieve national stability while becoming a refuge for persecuted peoples."
EDG_H10_ideas_6_desc:0 "We strive to become Germany's academic sanctuary, transforming outsiders' stereotypes of us as barbaric and crude. Universities cradle new ideas where students represent our national future - we inspire them to think freely and passionately for societal progress. Minor injuries from duels are mere small prices for great thinking. We believe we can become Germany's greatest Enlightenment center, a beacon of European scholarship and culture."
EDG_H10_ideas_7_desc:0 "We control extensive Elbe River territories with staple rights, requiring passing merchants to sell their goods here. Indeed, we've constructed earthworks ensuring they cannot bypass us. Thus diverse commodities trade in our markets, generating substantial urban wealth."

In 1134, preceding the 1147 Wendish Crusade, German noble Albert the Bear received the Northern March from Emperor Lothair III. Slavs were subsequently assimilated by German settlers during the Ostsiedlung migration movement."
EDG_H03_ideas_2_desc:0 "Though Nordmark temporarily lost electorship with the Brandenburg margravial title's forfeiture, Sigismund's death and Nordmark's reacquisition of Brandenburg restored the Nordmark margrave as one of seven electors. After centuries of dynastic changes between families, Nordmark rulers became adept at political manipulation - regardless of emperor, we shall remain the Empire's true power brokers."
EDG_H03_ideas_3_desc:0 "Under Albert's leadership, the Church established dioceses whose walls protected townspeople from attacks. As monastic and episcopal documented history recommenced, eponymous marches developed. The margraves' military and religious roles continued shaping Nordmark culture."
EDG_H03_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Joachimica Constitution comprises legal codes standardizing margravial succession and legal authority based on Roman law. Nordmark's adoption of Roman law worsened peasant status, reducing them to serfdom particularly east of the Elbe. Noble rights to evict landholding peasants (enclosure) were recognized (1535-1539)."
EDG_H03_ideas_5_desc:0 "King Fressilid the Great implemented drainage projects, abolished torture, and established an honest, efficient civil service system, famously declaring 'I am the state's first servant.' He significantly contributed to legal development, establishing numerous functional government departments replacing omnipotent chancelleries to strengthen economic leadership. From 1740 to 1777, Fressilid successively created ministries for commerce-industry, military administration, finance-tariffs, mining-metallurgy, and forestry. By his reign's end, he had essentially established comprehensive central economic departments ensuring unified, effective economic governance."
EDG_H03_ideas_6_desc:0 "Nobility and military formed Prussian monarchy's pillars. Fressilid the Great demanded iron discipline, elevating 'strict military discipline' to 'military soul' status. Fressilid II focused on cultivating officers' loyalty and military honor, controlling the entire army through them and harsh martial law. Soldier training proved exceptionally rigorous, with brutal corporal punishment permeating the military."
EDG_H03_ideas_7_desc:0 "In the mid-1740s, Fressilid the Great commissioned jurists to draft a new, universally valid legal system unifying inconsistent and contradictory legislation across Nordmark provinces. Von Cocceji served as the king's primary assistant and chair for legislative and judicial reforms. With his help, Fressilid established court regulations and unified judicial organization with prosecution statutes. The Public Law's formulation significantly influenced both Nordmark and other nations worldwide. Though this massive legislative work wasn't completed until five years after Fressilid's death, he and Von Cocceji undoubtedly laid its foundation."

Emulating the Eastern Roman Empire, he established a political-military system centered entirely on the emperor, requiring all citizens to perform military service. The emperor appointed military commanders as officials based solely on military merit rather than hereditary privilege, while Bulgarian tsars established imperial guards directly accountable to the tsar, similar to Rus' princes."
EDG_BU1_roma_idea_2_desc:0 "The five patriarchates are Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.

He established an independent legislative body comprising elected representatives and tsar-appointed councilors responsible for lawmaking and review. Furthermore, he strengthened the judicial system to ensure independence, separating courts from the executive branch. Ivan V also created a Privy Council directly commanded by the emperor, consisting of senior officials selected by the monarch to supervise and implement crucial policies, thereby reinforcing imperial autocratic power."

FRA_ideas_1_desc:0 "French kings established standing armies through ordinances setting long service terms, including the 'Compagnies d'Ordonnance.' Initially comprising 100 full 'Lances' - each with 1 heavy cavalryman, 1 squire, 3 archers, and 1 servant - this organization had little tactical relevance. Heavy cavalry formed separate tactical units while archers and squires assisted rather than charging alongside them. From Louis XII's reign (1498-1515), they increasingly organized into distinct companies soon termed 'light cavalry.'"
FRA_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Estates General, established in 1303 and continuing today, gradually evolved from royal convocation to electoral representation. Its long history lends legitimacy to multi-level assemblies and their levied taxes."
FRA_ideas_3_desc:0 "Louis XI's 'new monarchy' wasn't a centralized unified state. France divided into 12 gouvernements whose administration rested with royalty and nobility, legally exercising extensive royal privileges until century's end, maintaining autonomy until the next century. Numerous regional parlements emerged - provincial courts established by monarchy wielding supreme regional judicial authority."
FRA_ideas_4_desc:0 "French monarchs supported the Renaissance, protecting humanist thought. In 1530, Francis I founded the Collège Royal specializing in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. His 1539 edict approved Greek publications while mandating French in official documents. That year he established the Fontainebleau Library collecting ancient texts, later considered the National Library's precursor. To house artworks (many Italian), he expanded the Louvre while inviting prominent Italian humanists and artists like Leonardo da Vinci. Francis's declaration supporting literature earned him the title 'Father of French Letters' among French humanists."
FRA_ideas_5_desc:0 "Richelieu effectively established the intendant system. Intendants de Justice, de Police, and de Finances were commissioners granted extensive powers. Initially temporary inspectors with special missions, they became permanent central government representatives throughout France. Appointed directly by the king making positions non-removable and non-purchasable, these officials (often former maîtres des requêtes and minor nobility in the 17th century) represented the absolutist state's new power across the kingdom."

With cavalry as their main force, Uzbeks excel at flanking attacks and encirclement maneuvers - highly effective on Central Asian battlefields, causing significant enemy pressure and chaos. Uzbek cavalry frequently employs the 'Tulughma' tactic: elite warriors concentrate on wings while center forces envelop enemies in crescent formation."
EDG_Uzbekistan_2_desc:0 "Uzbek ethnogenesis traces to the early 14th century. We are followers of Jochid descendant Uzbek Khan, inheritors of Khaerkhan and Shaybani Khan - descendants of great conquerors."
EDG_Uzbekistan_3_desc:0 "Though the Uzbek Khanate founded by Khaerkhan has collapsed, we still claim its legacy, destined to conquer all northern nomadic homelands."
EDG_Uzbekistan_4_desc:0 "The Samanid Dynasty made Turkic tribes accept Persian culture and Islam through warfare, trade, commerce, and missionary work, forcibly incorporating Turkic prisoners into administrative systems. This accelerated Turkic nomadic-Persian urban civilization relations as numerous Turkic pastoralists migrated to prosperous cities, settling alongside Persians and East Iranians, commencing Central Asia's Turkification."
EDG_Uzbekistan_5_desc:0 "The Uzbek ethnicity formed through Sogdian-Turkic fusion. Many believe Uzbeks comprise seventy-two tribes - numerous, complex clans making our society more diverse and fluid."
EDG_Uzbekistan_6_desc:0 "Long influenced by Persian and Islamic cultures, Uzbeks developed unique Central Asian characteristics. Early social organization retained nomadic features, but settled agriculture gradually became primary livelihood. Though mid-16th century Uzbeks remained incompletely settled - consuming meat and dairy like Kazakhs without farming or bread - their sedentarization accelerated during the 16th century. By the 17th century, only Uzbeks and Tajiks remained in Transoxiana, jointly creating a heavenly land."

EDG_AJO_1_desc:0 "During the Middle Ages, Anjou evolved from a county to a duchy. The Counts of Anjou dominated neighboring territories including Nantes, Vendôme, and Maine, becoming one of France's largest principalities. One count, Geoffrey Plantagenet, married Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I (King of England and Duke of Normandy). Their son Henry II unified England, Normandy, Anjou with their dependencies, and through marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine (former wife of French King Louis VII) acquired Aquitaine, establishing the vast Angevin Empire. Though the main Angevin line later lost Angevin territories, we as a branch continue ruling the Duchy of Anjou, aspiring to restore the empire's vast domains."
EDG_AJO_2_desc:0 "Early in Charles the Bald's reign, Anjou faced dual threats from Brittany in the west and Normandy in the north. Former Count of Nantes Lambert allied with Breton Duke Nominoë to devastate Anjou. Thus Anjou required guardians of exceptional wisdom and courage. Angevin chroniclers consider 'Tertullus' the first Count of Anjou, personally elevated by Charles the Bald. Centuries later, Anjou still needs rulers combining intelligence and bravery."
EDG_AJO_3_desc:0 "The Angevin house has always epitomized chivalry. Our longstanding knightly traditions produce battlefield valor and tactical excellence - Angevin knights charging into medieval warfare earned renown across numerous campaigns."
EDG_AJO_4_desc:0 "The Duchy of Anjou exists within complex geopolitics where Normandy and Brittany long threaten our territorial security, while England and France make us their conflict focus, necessitating enhanced fortress systems against foreign invasion."
EDG_AJO_5_desc:0 "The Angevin court once served as Europe's cultural center where English, Aquitainians, and Champenois displayed their talents. Today our court remains synonymous with poetry, music, and arts."
EDG_AJO_6_desc:0 "The Duchy of Anjou occupies a unique position between England and France, historically connected to both nations through intricate ties. While participating in French politics, it maintains close familial connections with English royalty. Through marriages and alliances, Anjou became a crucial nexus for Anglo-French exchange and conflict."
EDG_AJO_7_desc:0 "Due to its special geographical position and historical experiences, the Duchy of Anjou blends multiple cultures - incorporating French romantic elements alongside British influences. Architecturally, it features both French monumental castles and English manor styles. In literature and arts, diverse poetic and painting styles intermingle. This cultural fusion generates innovative vitality, with Angevin artists and scholars absorbing different cultural essences to create unique Angevin culture that attracts regional exchange and learning."

Philip II became the 15th century's most renowned French chancellor - during his administration, Victorious Hugues maintained excellent relations with French nobles."
EDG_PTU_2_desc:0 "Duke Philip II displayed an enormous tapestry in his court. Amplifying such terrifying narratives across hundreds of feet of textile art inevitably stunned viewers into submitting to divine will. Who was chosen by God's will to rule these lands? Indeed... you. When understanding that obeying the duke meant obeying almighty God, none retreated from battlefields. Any fallen would resurrect immediately after the tapestry's depicted Judgment Day."
EDG_PTU_3_desc:0 "With coastal access, fishing and maritime exploration became vital Poitevin development directions. Poitou navigators harbored curiosity and yearning for unknown worlds, constructing sturdy yet agile vessels to sail the vast Atlantic."
EDG_PTU_4_desc:0 "Poitou literature primarily features poetry and legends recounting heroic deeds and romantic tragedies. This unique literary style shaped distinctive Poitevin lifestyles and intellectual culture."
EDG_PTU_5_desc:0 "Agriculture forms Poitou's foundation - fertile lands yield sweetest grapes. Through meticulous cultivation, Poitou vineyards produce premium wines becoming the duchy's signature product, highly sought in European markets."

EDG_PTU_7_desc:0 "Abundant travertine resources in Poitou serve as essential building cornerstones. Travertine-constructed castles prove exceptionally sturdy. Militarily, these castles provide formidable defense against invasions, acting as the duchy's impenetrable shield while symbolizing Poitou's regional importance.

Domestically, we actively promote French language, arts, and architecture to foster cultural prosperity. Internationally, we position ourselves as French culture's ambassadors, attracting foreign talent through cultural influence."
EDG_BOU_3_desc:0 "Bourbonnais stands at the crossroads between Langues d'oïl and Occitan. Though historically favoring northern dialects, our heritage remains deeply connected to Occitania, granting us easier access to Southern French support than our northern neighbors."
EDG_BOU_4_desc:0 "Our strategic central French location provides excellent natural defenses. The Massif Central's towering southern ridges and the east-flowing Loire River form natural barriers protecting most borders from attack."
EDG_BOU_5_desc:0 "During the 1540s, Calvinism spread through France as Huguenot faith. Southern French nobles adopted Calvinism to seize church lands, conflicting with northern Catholic nobles seeking separatism, escalating into prolonged civil war. Eight successive Catholic-Protestant conflicts devastated 16th-century France, but represented divine opportunity for the Bourbon dynasty."
EDG_BOU_6_desc:0 "Feudal politics' complexity subdivided the Bourbon house into branches like Bourbon-Montpensier and Condé. Several noble families gained significant influence in French affairs."
EDG_BOU_7_desc:0 "The Bourbon dynasty continuously strengthened absolute monarchy. Kings wielded absolute power for swift decision-making. Domestically, this enabled efficient implementation of economic and military reforms without excessive noble obstruction.

EDG_AMG_4_desc:0 "Auch, capital of Armagnac, serves as the archepiscopal see of the Archdiocese of Auch. Dating back to the 6th century, it enjoys the prestige of Primate of Aquitaine and Navarre."
EDG_AMG_5_desc:0 "We hold no particular affection for Catholicism, having early converted to Catharism. Amid the Reformation's tides, we eagerly embrace our role as pioneers of change."
EDG_AMG_6_desc:0 "Since Romans introduced grapes to Gascony, Arabs brought distillation technology, and ancestral Celts invented oak barrels, brandy production has evolved.

EDG_FCC_1_desc:0 "Franche-Comté serves both as a French royal vassal and Holy Roman Imperial prince. Leveraging its strategic location, it navigates between France and the Empire, skillfully using dual status to pledge loyalty to the French crown for resources while maintaining imperial alliances. Through diplomatic maneuvering in complex international relations, it preserves independence and avoids excessive interference from either power."
EDG_FCC_2_desc:0 "Recognizing limited military capacity, Franche-Comté extensively employs Swiss mercenaries for our defense needs."
EDG_FCC_3_desc:0 "Franche-Comté blends French and German cultures, incorporating French romance and elegance alongside imperial rigor and tradition. This cultural synthesis manifests in architectural styles, artistic creation, and social customs."
EDG_FCC_4_desc:0 "Despite being French royal vassals, Franche-Comté staunchly defends its autonomous rights as imperial princes. While fulfilling feudal obligations, we actively participate in imperial affairs to secure greater autonomy from the emperor. This vassal autonomy philosophy maintains relative independence within the feudal system, preventing excessive control while protecting local noble and common interests."
EDG_FCC_5_desc:0 "As imperial princes, Franche-Comté values alliances with other imperial states. We actively join princely leagues to collectively safeguard imperial princes' rights, cooperating closely in military defense, economic collaboration, and cultural exchange. These alliances enhance our imperial influence while resisting centralizing pressures."

lot_glory_of_charlemagne_desc:0 "The Four Nations' War was a prolonged conflict between France, England, Arles, and Lotharingia, involving England's Richard VI, Lotharingia's Louis VII, France's Hugues VII, and Arles' Robert II. This massive war concluded with France repelling the triple invasion. Though the Kingdom of Lotharingia failed to conquer France, the conflict enhanced its military traditions - Louis VII gained loyal, skilled officers while Lotharingian soldiers gained valuable experience."

EDG_IR1_idea_1_desc:0 "Since the Sassanid Empire's collapse, Iran has endured prolonged suffering - this vast land experienced extended fragmentation and foreign domination under Arabs, Mongols, and Timurids, or remained divided. This resulted in Persians, Azerbaijanis, Turkmens, Kurds and others coexisting long-term without unified national identity. By establishing Christianity as the state faith and using Persian culture as unifying bond, we've integrated these diverse ethnic groups into a unified Iranian Empire. As the first unified Iranian empire since Achaemenids and Sassanids, we're hailed as the 'Third Iranian Empire.'"
EDG_IR1_idea_2_desc:0 "Establishing Christianity as state religion marks one of Iran's most crucial historical turning points. Previously adhering to Zoroastrianism and Islam, neither decadent Zoroastrianism nor foreign Islam could represent Iran's will. Only Christianity can save Iran, only God's mercy can rescue the Iranian people. Thus we've built a Christian empire with extensive ecclesiastical institutions, consigning all heretics and infidels to the stake."
EDG_IR1_idea_3_desc:0 "Ancient Iran's bureaucratic system was a complex, evolving institution developing across multiple historical stages from early civilization through Islamic era to modern times. This system reflected Iran's political structure while embodying institutionalized operations in administration, taxation, judiciary, and military affairs. Since the Achaemenid Empire, Iran maintained relatively sophisticated administrative bureaucracy that continues operating with preserved distinctive features through ongoing reforms and development."
EDG_IR1_idea_4_desc:0 "The legend of Prester John first appeared in a 1165 letter purportedly from the mysterious 'Prester John' ruling a Christian realm in the East. This letter rapidly circulated throughout Europe, undergoing continuous modification and embellishment to enhance its marvel and appeal. Europeans believed finding Prester John would provide crusaders with crucial allies against Muslim enemies. Though our empire was recently established, Europeans will believe we are the legendary Prester John."
EDG_IR1_idea_5_desc:0 "The Persian Immortals were elite heavy infantry forming the Achaemenid Empire's military core, renowned for exceptional combat effectiveness and strict discipline. This force played vital roles under Persian monarchs including Cyrus the Great, Cambyses II, and Darius I. Though centuries have passed, the 'Immortals' name still inspires every Iranian warrior. We shall resurrect this formation to crush those who dare slaughter and oppress Iranians, treating them as livestock and slaves."
EDG_IR1_idea_6_desc:0 "The Iranian Renaissance represents a complex movement encompassing cultural, artistic, political, and social dimensions, aiming to address national challenges amid modernization and globalization by reviving traditional culture and values. This movement emphasizes excavating and inheriting Persian cultural heritage spanning poetry, literature, architecture, and arts. The Shahnameh epic exemplifies Persian culture, recording Iranian history while symbolizing national spirit and heroism. Advocates believe Iran's decline partly stems from overreliance on Western and Islamic cultures, necessitating return to core Persian values like wisdom, justice, tolerance, and chivalry. Persian language serves as crucial cultural component bridging past and future, while celebrating traditional festivals strengthens national cultural identity."
EDG_IR1_idea_7_desc:0 "The Fifth Monarchy's core belief anticipates Christ's imminent return to establish a millennial kingdom. This ideology derives from biblical eschatological prophecies, particularly Daniel and Revelation describing four ancient empires (Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman) preceding Christ's Fifth Empire. Since unifying Iran, we've championed Fifth Monarchy ideology, with our people believing we embody this prophesied kingdom."
