rigaExpand.0.desc:0 "The current state of the Bishopric of Riga is far from optimistic. Although we are surrounded by the Livonian Order and under its protection, their past performances in battle worry [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to protect the bishopric once more—neither the Battle of Saule in 1236 nor the Battle on the Ice in 1242 showcased satisfactory results.\n\nThus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] hopes to unite the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Order. The Livonian Order has long protected the Bishopric of Riga; although it was previously dissolved and incorporated into the Teutonic Order, it now enjoys considerable autonomy, effectively acting as an entity independent of the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Order, meanwhile, has persistently sought expansion toward Poland and Lithuania, making it increasingly isolated diplomatically and less likely to heed [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advice. Nonetheless, we can still attempt to propose it."

To further expand the bishopric's interests and extend the 'business' of selling indulgences, the [root.GovernmentName] must plan its strategic priorities. Thus, [root.Monarch.GetTitle] [root.Monarch.GetName] has today gathered elites from various strata to chart the next course of action. Where will Riga's future lie?\n\nTo the north, Sweden's control over the Baltic Sea is growing stronger daily. If we aim to monopolize Baltic trade, Sweden will be our primary foe. Defeating Sweden will be no easy task, but perhaps we can leverage the crowns of Norway and the County of Skåne.\n\nAlthough the Baltic region is under our control, we do not hold the initiative in Baltic trade. The gradual decline of the Hanseatic League, represented downstream by Lübeck, forces us to seek alternative paths. The commercial city league born from the Danish revolt of 1439 may be an excellent choice; they compete with Lübeck, and perhaps we can draw them into our own commercial alliance. Upstream, trade is controlled by the Novgorodian heretics. Given that the Grand Duchy of Tver in the east is rising and seems intent on unifying northeastern Rus', perhaps we should act sooner rather than later.\n\nTo the south, the fragmentation of the Polish crown and the civil war in Kievan Rus' have created a vacuum of regional power, but this situation will not last long. As another upstream power in the Baltic, we must secure control over Kraków and cleanse the legacy of the Hussites. Regarding Kiev, whether it is the unexpected rise of the Bogomils or the Orthodox Church, they will be enemies we must face. The civil war in Kievan Rus' will not last forever; we hope to achieve our objectives before another power emerges.\n\nNow, let us choose our target."

However, given the current circumstances, all of this seems nothing more than a fantasy.\n\nA secret meeting might reveal their resolve—if they dare to openly rebel against Sweden, we will offer our support. Of course, this will not come free; we shall receive commercial privileges in the Øresund to secure our trade advantage in the Baltic and Lübeck region, and it could also lay the groundwork for our future advance into Scandinavia. If their so-called determination proves lacking, then we will personally 'assist' them in achieving their goal."

The treaty stipulates that Riga will thereafter receive commercial privileges within our nation. However, compared to independence, the terms proposed by Riga remain highly attractive.\n\nIf we gain the support of the Bishopric of Riga, our path to independence will be smooth.

rigaExpand.30.name:0 "Hanseatic Strategy"
rigaExpand.30.desc:0 "The term 'Hanseatic League' first appeared in 1344, initially as a commercial union sharing privileges. By 1356, the merchant Hansa evolved into a city Hansa, with its members including most North German coastal cities. Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen were its core, later joined by Cologne, Danzig, and Königsberg. In 1358, cities on the eastern Baltic coast like Riga also joined the Hanseatic League. The league monopolized the intermediary trade between Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and Western Europe, and also traded in Eastern products such as spices and precious textiles through Italian merchants. In 1367, representatives from 77 member cities held their first meeting in Cologne. The league established a supreme council and a supreme court; member cities had to abide by the decisions of its governing bodies. The cities shared public finances and a navy, and had the authority to conduct diplomacy, declare war, make peace, and sign treaties.\n\nBy the mid-14th century, the Hanseatic League had expanded to include all German port cities along the southern and eastern Baltic coasts and spread to various parts of Europe. While the league's influence was immense, for present-day Riga, this is not a sustainable long-term strategy. The Hanseatic League's longstanding principle of 'procuring only from the cheapest regions' hindered the development of agriculture and handicrafts in its core territories, a potentially fatal flaw. If merchants rely solely on commercial means to reap huge profits, they are bound to face backlash from their own policies. Although the Hanseatic League currently faces no strong commercial competition, as regional powers consolidate and new powers emerge, a purely mercantilist and protectionist approach will become increasingly inadequate.\n\nNow, there is an urgent need to develop our commerce in a form distinct from traditional trade. We should reduce our emphasis on trade within the traditional business model, and instead encourage handicrafts and agriculture to increase the quantity and quality of our products, achieving commercial 'self-sufficiency.' This approach would not rely solely on 'buying low and selling high' to secure profits, and it would also ensure a degree of robustness in our commercial activities during times of war."

Thus, in the face of complex threats to their interests, internal divisions are beginning to emerge. Some member cities seek to gain advantageous positions at the expense of others. With Riga formally announcing its challenge for Baltic trade hegemony, this tendency will immediately intensify. Hanseatic League members are becoming restless, with some already expressing concern that the situation may develop unfavorably for us. Therefore, the Hanseatic League must also reunite to address the impact brought by Riga."

rigaExpandIncident.0.desc:0 "For a long time, commerce in Northern Germany has been largely dominated by the Wendish and Saxon circles of the Hanseatic League. Through the activities of Hanseatic merchants, the secular princes within the Empire, whose economies were mostly based on the manorial system with limited and inefficient production, gained significant commercial benefits after establishing trade relations with the Hanseatic League. Upon joining the League, the raw materials produced in their own territories could be sold at higher prices in foreign markets, while they could obtain higher-quality imported goods. The import and export duties levied by Hanseatic merchants also provided the state treasuries with a stable and reliable source of revenue. Consequently, various principalities welcomed the Hanseatic League to set up trading posts in their lands.\n\nHowever, with the rise of another Baltic city, Riga, the commercial dominance of the Hanseatic League in the Baltic region began to waver, and competition between the two intensified. The Bishopric of Riga and the Hanseatic leader, Lübeck, have engaged in a series of commercial conflicts over the past period. Recently, the newly formed trade alliance between the Bishopric of Riga and various Danish city-states has brought this war to a climax. North German principalities, seeking to protect their own interests, have begun to lean towards one side or the other, implementing supportive policies and actions to secure greater profits. This, in turn, has further fractured the already strained relations among the princes, each with their own grievances. Minor skirmishes involving mercenaries are frequent across the region, and economic instability has led to more frequent peasant uprisings. As the trade war continues, the entire Empire is now more or less affected by the North German trade war. Rebellion, famine, and conflict loom over the Empire constantly."

Faced with the deteriorating war situation, the Emperor also began negotiations with the Bishopric of Riga.\n\nThe economic losses from the war were severe. Although we held the advantage, we still suffered heavy costs. Continuing the war would bring no benefit and only cause further deterioration of the North German economy, which clearly contradicted our original intentions. Therefore, Riga presented the Emperor with a treaty. This treaty confirmed the absolute dominance of the Bishopric of Riga over the Hanseatic League.

The spread of the Devotio Moderna within the Empire, the propagation of Hussitism, and the firmly entrenched Catharism in Provence all threaten the Catholic world. However, beyond these established, tangible enemies, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] is even more concerned about the future. Due to the failures of the Albigensian Crusades and the rise of imperial authority, various Catholic sovereign states in Europe are beginning to slip from papal control. Concurrently, the Italian Renaissance severely impacts local Catholic churches. The growing merchant class and the actions of the Roman Catholic Church in the German lands breed widespread discontent. It is foreseeable that in the near future, a religious reformation targeting Catholicism will unfold, and Riga must then make its choice.\n\nCompared to the problems we may face in the future, the state of Riga's military is our most pressing concern now. For a long time, we have relied on the independent forces of various bishoprics, combined with knightly orders and military districts for warfare. Consequently, the problems of the Archbishopric's direct forces have not been exposed in battle. Yet the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] knows the quality of these troops is far from optimistic. The mobilizable manpower of a single city is always limited. Conscripting widely within Riga's walls would not only drastically reduce the urban population but also breed local resentment. Historically, we have conducted recruitment across various bishoprics, then gathered and reorganized the troops. This results in a chaotic mix of recruits, with significant differences in language and customs—a fatal flaw for a force requiring high coordination. Moreover, in past conflicts, we over-relied on the better-trained forces of knightly orders and military districts. While we achieved continuous victories, this fostered complacent generals and increasingly corrupt armies, as they realized they could win wars without even taking the field. To them, training seemed pointless. Fortunately, our bishoprics have not yet extensively questioned our military prowess. Maintaining a sufficiently large army can still command their respect—but the paper tiger will inevitably be exposed one day. §RWhen that time comes, we shall surely crumble§!."

rigaExpand.82.desc:0 "Overall, Riga's administrative system is beyond reproach, effectively maintaining the administrative affairs of its various bishoprics. However, Riga is clearly not content with the status quo. The demands of expansion necessitate reforms to the administrative system. Governing a larger state requires a more robust administrative framework, especially for a nation like Riga, built upon control over individual bishoprics. The prosperity and stability of these subject states are essential, potentially even more crucial than the development of Riga city itself.\n\nWith the continuous growth of Baltic commerce, the increasing volume of trade has caused Riga's outer districts to expand into the territories of the Livonian Order. This expansion, focused on trade and production, does nothing to improve our administrative system. On the contrary, it forces us to allocate more administrative capacity to manage Riga's increasingly vast trade and production networks. The expansion rate of the inner city's administrative system merely keeps pace with our current needs. We must find suitable methods to enhance the city's administrative capabilities, whether through streamlining the inner-city bureaucracy or through physical expansion. The immediate priority is to increase paper production—an indispensable tool for governing a state."
rigaExpand.82.aa:0 "Paper is the future!"

rigaExpand.83.name:0 "Calm Waters"
rigaExpand.83.desc:0 "Within the intricate streets of Riga's inner city, robed clerical administrators are a common sight. The process of managing the various bishoprics is not particularly complex in theory. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wishes to send an order to a subject state, the command must first be relayed to the specific administrative department within Riga responsible for that subject. Personnel from that department then transmit the order to the target state. The communication of requests from subject states simply reverses this process.\n\nTo maintain up-to-date knowledge of each subject's situation, each bishopric is required to periodically report its finances, active military strength, population, etc., to Riga. This allows Riga to coordinate trade and economic distribution among the subjects and provide appropriate guidance on their developmental focus. Although our subject states enjoy considerable autonomy in policy implementation, they lack Riga's extensive administrative system and information sources. While each bishopric may manage its own affairs well and respond to sudden crises, ultimately, this relies on their individual capacity to alleviate pressure. Intervention by the Archbishopric of Riga can mobilize other subjects to assist, each contributing their strengths to achieve coordinated development and collectively overcome crises.\n\nThe drawbacks of this system are also evident. The perennial issue of corruption is unavoidable, meaning the data Riga receives on paper sometimes requires personnel to be dispatched for verification, affecting the timeliness of information and potentially leading to erroneous orders. More importantly, as the bishoprics develop, new cities are established and expanded. The growth of subject administrative bodies necessitates corresponding adjustments in Riga's own administration, and an increase in the number of subjects will further escalate Riga's administrative expenditures."

Large-scale changes to the administrative structure will inevitably entangle the interests of all parties, leading to evident issues such as decreased administrative efficiency due to poor inter-departmental coordination and uprisings fueled by discontent with policy implementation. However, this is not without solution—opposition is inevitable during transformation. If we possess sufficient 'strength' and employ a mix of persuasion and coercion, we can make them understand their place.\n\nCompared to radical, rapid reform, perhaps a gradual approach is more suited to Riga's current situation. It is not necessary for all subject states to reform immediately. We can first select a subject state deemed suitable for reform and proceed to the next only after its completion. While this method prolongs the overall reform period, it helps maintain the stability of the Archbishopric during the process."

They widely publicize the disparities between the inner and outer districts, pressuring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to demand fairer treatment. Coincidentally, rumors of the outer district unrest have sparked disturbances in the middle districts as well—though initially not threatening, until a ship laden with gold and silver bound for Riga was seized by a group of radical insurgents. The wealth accumulated through Riga's long prosperity has now become another fuse for rebellion.\n\nSuch incidents are hardly uncommon. However, due to the ongoing reforms, the government's response has been slow. By the time action was taken, it became clear that unrest was spreading through Riga like wildfire. Equal distribution cannot satisfy everyone, and when faced with vast, seemingly attainable wealth, desire becomes the driving force behind all actions.\n\nGiven Riga's immense urban scale, deploying the army for suppression would cause severe damage to the city districts.

The crusade is divided into two major directions: The first will march south from Podolia, crossing Moldavia and Wallachia to Constantinople, then cross the Bosporus to besiege Ankara and Karaman, proceed south along the Gulf of Cyprus to Antioch, and finally capture the Holy City of Jerusalem. The second crusade will set out from Kiev and Tver to purge the heretics of the Eastern European steppes and the Ural region, then advance into Central Asia and Siberia. Unlike the first crusade with a defined route, the second has only a broad directive: to expand Riga's influence in Central Asia and Siberia and spread the Gospel of Christ to the East.\n\nSuch an enormous war plan would have been a fantasy in the past, but today Riga possesses the capability to realize it.

They possess highly elite military capabilities, serving as garrison territories to protect the archbishopric. However, due to their limited size, the orders cannot efficiently manage large areas of land; therefore, their territorial scope should be kept at a reasonable level.\n\nThe other subsidiary bishoprics of Riga represent the administrative extension of the Archbishopric of Riga. They possess relatively independent political and military systems, but each bishopric also has distinct functional tendencies: Administrative Regions focus on administrative planning and maintaining stability in their areas, allowing them to manage large territories efficiently but with certain limitations in military and economic aspects. Economic Regions prioritize economic development, reducing taxes on peasants within their areas and encouraging agriculture and handicrafts to boost production and foster regional prosperity. However, due to their focus on economic affairs, they have significant shortcomings in military and administrative capabilities, making it difficult to manage large areas or maintain local stability effectively. Military Districts possess high potential for military development and directly represent Riga's military strength alongside the knightly orders. Larger military districts provide stronger military power, but the risk of them breaking away from the archbishopric also increases accordingly."

Joining the Hanseatic League brought considerable profits, but such gains are not permanent. Only substantial development of resources can yield longer-term benefits. This has led to the formation of a unique economic system in Riga: subsidiary states will fully transfer their trade systems to the Archbishopric of Riga, retaining only a portion, or even no independent trade system at all. Riga will centralize the trade of its subjects' goods for profit.\n\nCoordinating such vast trade clearly cannot be done by the city of Riga alone. Therefore, Trade Zones were established to help alleviate Riga's burden. These specialized trading cities focus primarily on commerce. Although dependent on Riga, to maintain a certain level of operation during wartime, they do not participate in Riga's offensive wars."

However, after unification, the orders have once again demonstrated their renewed military prowess to all.\n\nThanks to the guidance of the knightly orders, Rigan forces, while not as elite as the orders themselves, remain capable in battle. However, since recruitment must largely take place in subject cities, employing mercenaries is also a viable option. In summary, Riga's current military engagements primarily rely on the forces of various subjects, such as the knightly orders and military districts, as the mainstay.

It was founded in 1099. In 1113, the Papacy recognized its status as an independent order and granted it a series of economic and political privileges, such as exemption from tithes and from the authority of any secular power, answering only to the Pope.\n\nIn its early years, it was merely a charitable organization. It was not until around 1120 that the Knights Hospitaller began to operate as a military order, using force to protect pilgrims from attacks by infidels. It evolved into a significant military force within the Kingdom of Jerusalem and exerted considerable influence on its politics.\n\nDuring the Battle of Hattin in 1187, the Knights Hospitaller also committed its main forces. Due to command errors, the Christian army, including the Hospitallers and Templars, was nearly annihilated. With the end of the 'Crusade of France' in 1222, the Hospitallers received no reinforcements. Finally, in 1291, the Order abandoned Palestine, moving to Cyprus, and then to Rhodes in 1309, where they eventually lost their last territorial holdings.\n\nAccording to the terms offered by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName], the Knights Hospitaller will receive territorial rights to the island of Gotland and will pledge fealty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The transfer of territory does not mean the abandonment of their duties.

RigaExpandSupplement.11.desc:0 "The Knights Templar, officially known as 'The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon,' were founded in 1119 by the French noblemen Hugues de Payens and Godfrey de Saint-Omer. They established a monastic order based at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount to protect pilgrims and attack infidels. The mosque was built on the ruins of the ancient Temple of Solomon, hence the order's name. Initially, it had nine members.\n\nIn 1129, the Roman Church convened the Council of Troyes in France, where the Pope formally recognized their status. This council was a milestone, establishing the Rule for the Knights Templar and confirming their legitimate position throughout Christendom and the supreme authority of the Papacy over them. Papal recognition further expanded the Templars' influence in Europe and legitimized their receipt of donations from Christians.\n\nThe Battle of Hattin in 1187 saw the Templars besieged by Saladin's forces, with most members either killed or wounded. That same year, Saladin captured Jerusalem. The Templars retreated, eventually reaching Cyprus and finally returning to France.\n\nIn 1221, the Templars supported a new 'French Crusade' initiated by the Dauphin, Count Louis of Artois. Although this crusade did not achieve its initial objectives, Christians still gained a foothold in North Africa. Following a series of military and diplomatic failures, the Kingdom of Tunisia ultimately fell, and the Templars lost their lands in North Africa, returning once more to France.\n\nDespite accumulating considerable wealth in the past, a stark reality is that the Templars currently hold no actual territory, rendering their actions subject to the will of others. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] has offered the Grand Master of the Knights Templar a proposition: to grant them territories in the Eastern European steppes in exchange for their fealty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

As transoceanic trade rises, Riga's naval development must also adapt.\n\nSimilar to Riga's past army situation, each bishopric subject state maintains a relatively independent navy, with vessels of varying specifications and types built and owned locally. However, the scale of these bishopric fleets is clearly not as extensive as Riga's. Therefore, we only need to spend a certain amount of time to standardize the construction and management of all subject vessels, subsequently placing them under Riga's direct command.

RigaExpandSupplement.27.name:0 "The Place Where the Schism Began"
RigaExpandSupplement.27.desc:0 "In 858 AD, the Roman Emperor appointed Photios as Patriarch of Constantinople. The Pope in Rome refused to recognize this and excommunicated Photios. Photios, believing his authority was no less than the Pope's, excommunicated Pope Nicholas I in 867, marking the beginning of the rupture between the two.\n\nIn the 6th century, Spain converted to Catholicism. Without the consent of the Orthodox Church, the Spanish Church first altered the Nicene Creed phrase regarding the Holy Spirit proceeding 'from the Father' to 'from the Father and the Son.' The Orthodox Church considered this a violation of the commonly held creed, leading to prolonged dispute—the so-called 'Filioque' controversy—which was temporarily resolved. In 1014, the Pope reintroduced the 'Filioque' clause into the Nicene Creed, reigniting the conflict.\n\nIn 1054, Patriarch Michael I Cerularius of Constantinople accused the Western Church of using unleavened bread for the Eucharist. Pope Leo IX sent Cardinal Humbert and two others with a sternly worded letter to Constantinople that April, demanding negotiations over alleged heresies within the Constantinopolitan Church. Leo IX died on April 19th. Humbert and his delegation, feeling slighted in Constantinople and with Cerularius refusing to discuss the accusations, became infuriated. On July 16th, Humbert marched into the Hagia Sophia and, before a large assembly, placed a 'bull' of excommunication condemning the Eastern Church and deposing the Patriarch on the altar, then stormed out. This bull accused the Orthodox Church of harboring various heresies—Arianism, Valesianism, Donatism, Nicolaitism, simony, etc.—and announced the excommunication of Patriarch Cerularius. This greatly angered Cerularius. With the Byzantine Emperor's support, Cerularius retaliated, convening a synod at the Hagia Sophia on July 20th. He condemned and burned the Pope's letter, denounced Humbert and his envoys as 'impious men,' and declared the excommunication of the Pope and his legates, proclaiming himself the head of the Eastern Church. This marked the definitive schism between the Eastern and Western Churches.\n\nAlthough we currently control the Orthodox Church of Constantinople, healing a schism that has lasted centuries cannot be accomplished overnight. We must await a more opportune moment to complete this great task."

RigaExpandSupplement.28.name:0 "Journey to Jerusalem"
RigaExpandSupplement.28.desc:0 "According to the Bible, before the Israelites settled in Jerusalem, many peoples had intermixed in this area. When the Israelites entered Canaan, a Canaanite tribe—the Jebusites—lived near Jerusalem. The Israelite tribe of Judah conquered the city of Jerusalem, and the tribe of Benjamin occupied it, coexisting peacefully with the Jebusites living within. Around 1000 BC, King David led the Israelites in conquering the city, expanding it southward, establishing it as his capital, and changing its name to Yerushalayim (Jerusalem). He also brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and set up a tabernacle for it.\n\nDuring the First Crusade in 1099, the Crusaders' most significant victory against the Muslims in the Eastern wars was the capture of the Holy City of Jerusalem and the Lord's Holy Sepulchre. This caused an unprecedented sensation in the Western Christian world, a perfect triumph Pope Urban II could never have imagined before his death. Naturally, it was celebrated and recounted for generations throughout Christendom. Many accompanying clergy and later ecclesiastical chroniclers strove to record this event, praising Christ's power, spreading the tale as if it were a miracle. At the same time, this war and the subsequent establishment of Latin Outremer profoundly impacted the entire Eastern Mediterranean landscape, like a stone causing ripples, drawing intense attention from all sides. Byzantines, Armenians, Turks, Arabs—historians of various religious backgrounds and different statuses all wrote accounts, detailing the event for reflection and learning.\n\nAlthough fraught with difficulties, Jerusalem was not returned to Christian hands until centuries after the fall of Acre in 1291. However, having been under Muslim control for so long, many Muslims still reside within the city. Expelling the infidels would increase our authority within the Papacy, but this is not the only solution. A more moderate approach would be to pardon these infidels.

During the Roman Empire, Antioch was one of the Empire's most prosperous cities, with a population reaching a staggering 500,000 at its peak. However, after a major earthquake in 526 AD, the city was almost entirely destroyed, and Antioch fell into decline.\n\nOver the following centuries, Antioch changed hands multiple times but was always recaptured by Christians. Until 1268, when Baybars began its siege and captured Antioch on May 18th. Baybars ordered the city razed to the ground, all men killed, and women enslaved. The once-great city of Antioch vanished. Twenty years later, the last Crusader stronghold in Jerusalem, Acre, fell. The Crusader flags that had flown over the Christian Holy Cities for 200 years disappeared from the Near Eastern horizon.\n\nAs we raise the Crusader banners once more in the Holy Land, this sacred city deserves to regain its former prosperity."

It was also home to the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria and the Library of Alexandria.\n\nHowever, after Egypt's Islamic rulers founded Cairo in 969 and moved the capital there, Alexandria's status gradually declined. The discovery of the Cape of Good Hope route in 1498 dealt a final blow to Alexandria's economy, and the city began to shrink in size year by year.\n\nWe have no reason to allow this once-glorious city to continue its decline.

rigExpandAction.50.name:0 "Rigan Religious Reform"
rigExpandAction.50.desc:0 "The Renaissance laid the intellectual groundwork for religious reform, with the humanist movement challenging medieval authority.\n\nHumanists like Erasmus focused on establishing schools, printing the Bible and works of the Church Fathers, hoping to reform society and restore Christian unity by opening new fields of learning. Although they did not question traditional fundamental doctrines and even opposed schismatic activities to maintain the traditional church structure, through their study of primitive Christianity, they recognized that the contemporary church's hierarchy, secularization of the clergy, and the tedious debates of scholasticism had all deviated from the original Christian teachings, signaling the impending collapse of Christianity.\n\nA few thinkers boldly challenged traditional notions. For instance, the biblical scholar Wycliffe first proposed that the authority of the Bible surpassed that of the Pope, that only God could forgive sins, and that salvation was achieved through faith and direct communion with God. In this theological view, the status of divine authority and the visible organization of the church was greatly diminished.\n\nMartin Luther praised Wycliffe's teachings and published them in 1522, forming the blueprint for the fundamental doctrines of the Reformation. By the 14th and 15th centuries, the Bible had been translated into several languages. Coupled with the invention and application of the printing press, more people could read the Bible directly, gradually enhancing religious awareness among people everywhere.\n\nIn the year [GetYear], numerous churches and theologians in Riga engaged in a series of debates on the current state of religion. At the final council presided over by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName], Catholicism was confirmed as the sole faith in Riga. However, on the premise of maintaining core doctrines, it was acknowledged that some compromise on certain teachings was necessary. Although this move would displease the Pope, the progress of the age constantly reminds us of the need for change; stubborn adherence to the past brings no benefit."

The various bishopric subject states also hold their own attitudes toward the situation—some opposing the current state, others waiting to see—all acting to maximize their own interests.\n\nYet the unrest among the Archbishopric's loyalists is merely the surface manifestation. Following two major disasters, the administrative efficiency of the Archbishopric of Riga has significantly declined. The bishopric subjects now must not only deliberate on the sovereignty of the Archbishopric but also stabilize the disrupted economic and political structures.\n\nDue to Riga's current state, the problems faced by each subject state have intensified over the past months, with various violent incidents occurring frequently. Any class, group, or individual seeking to achieve their goals has begun to act, attempting to secure the greatest benefit from this disaster. The most expedient and effective way to legitimize these benefits is to participate in the struggle over the sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Riga.\n\nThus, diverse and complex forces have begun to clash under a unified overarching objective.

However, as the system expanded, the speed of information acquisition from distant subject regions continuously decreased. Moreover, various issues arose during the transmission of this information, and the cost for Riga to verify and screen such information grew increasingly high, giving rise to necessary decentralization policies. While other European nations were intensifying centralization, Riga could only expand its vassal system by continually delegating power.\n\nPast reforms may have, to some extent, prevented subordinates from overpowering superiors, but this did not permanently solve the stability of the entire vassal system. As the military and economic strength of each bishopric developed, the classes beneath them also began active maneuvers, seeking to maximize their interests in various ways. Among these participants were numerous 'ruffians'.\n\nWhen the scale was smaller, Riga could still regulate internal affairs within each subject. With territorial expansion, the actions of various separatists and religious rebels grew more severe and widespread. Violent incidents in distant bishoprics far from Riga occurred frequently and spread like wildfire. Different rebel groups within the jurisdictions of various bishoprics colluded, continuously disrupting the bishoprics' operations. Moreover, various classes within the bishoprics were restless, attempting to extract greater benefits from this vast machinery.\n\nThe problems caused by excessive and unchecked expansion extend beyond internal strife. External powers have detected that Riga is mired in internal governance conflicts, quietly awaiting the collapse of this massive administrative machine, ready to seize a share from its wreckage.

We must now rely on ourselves to overcome the coming difficulties.\n\nSince its founding, Rigaeria has established a highly autonomous republican system where each region possesses considerable military and economic self-governance, not vastly different from Riga. However, the distinction lies in how Rigaeria unites the entire nation through a 'confederation' rather than a hierarchical vassal relationship like Riga's. This has its pros and cons: the advantage is the highly efficient speed of colonization and missionary activities in unexplored territories; the disadvantage, however, is now being demonstrated 'vividly'.\n\nJust a few months ago, when news arrived that distant Riga could no longer spare any resources to support Rigaeria, domestic unrest began. Rigaeria had to cut expenses and open new revenue streams to maintain normal state operations.

Simultaneously, they gradually realized that seceding from the nation better served their interests, marking the beginning of Rigaeria's collapse.\n\nWithin a few short weeks, regions across Rigaeria ceased obeying the central government's control and recently declared independence.

RigaExpandFlavour.0.name:0 "City Log: Königsberg"
RigaExpandFlavour.0.desc:0 "Originally, the location of Königsberg was home to several settlements established by the Old Prussians, known as Twangste. In 1255, the Teutonic Order conquered the Prussian Sambian tribe, Twangste was destroyed, and a new fortress was built on the site, named Königsberg, meaning 'King's Mountain,' in honor of the Bohemian King Ottokar II Přemysl. It was King Ottokar who funded the construction of the first castle here, Königsberg Castle. Around the new castle, three towns gradually developed along the Pregolya River: Altstadt, Kneiphof, and Löbenicht, approximately 4.5 miles from the Vistula Lagoon. The Teutonic Order used Königsberg as a base for conquering the Sambian Peninsula and fighting the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From 1262 to 1263, Prussians revolted against the Teutonic Knights' forced religious conversion, besieging Königsberg. The fortress was ultimately relieved with the help of the Livonian Order.\n\nIn 1340, Königsberg became a member of the Hanseatic League. The city rapidly developed into a major port in the southeastern Baltic, trading goods from Prussia, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1324 and 1330, the writer Peter of Dusburg likely composed his masterwork, the Chronicon terrae Prussiae, in Königsberg. Despite suffering a devastating defeat at the Battle of Grunwald, Königsberg remained under Teutonic control throughout the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War. However, the Livonian Order took over the defense of Königsberg and participated in the reconstruction of towns occupied by the forces of Władysław II Jagiełło.\n\nAs military conflicts in the Teutonic Order's heartland diminished, Königsberg began to expand its urban areas outward, seeking faster development. The surrounding economy also began to grow under its influence."

RigaExpandFlavour.1.desc:0 "In 1274, after suppressing the 'Great Prussian Uprising,' the Teutonic Order began constructing a high castle, with work continuing into the early 14th century. Upon completion, the high castle served as an integrated complex for both religious and defensive purposes, unique among contemporary European castle architecture, thus becoming a model for later castles built by the Order. In 1309, the Grand Master of the Order moved its headquarters from Venice to Marienburg, initiating a new phase of castle construction. Gradually, a middle castle was built around Marienburg, roughly square in shape, consisting of three connected buildings surrounding a square courtyard. The northwest side housed the Grand Master's Palace and the Knights' Hall, the northeast side contained the entrance and guest reception area, the southeast side accommodated guest quarters, and the fourth side opened toward the high castle, accessible via a passageway. Simultaneously, Marienburg underwent extensive renovations, expanding in area and increasing in overall height.\n\nThis castle currently covers an area four times that of Windsor Castle and can accommodate approximately 3,000 members of the Order. By area, Marienburg ranks among the world's largest European-style castles and is Europe's largest brick-built structure. As the Teutonic Order's headquarters continued to expand, further enlargement of this castle was planned. Although Marienburg remained primarily a military facility, due to the Order's growing size and the decreasing frequency of local conflicts, various industries gradually developed around the castle. Supported by merchants arriving via the port of Danzig, the Marienburg region gradually prospered."

RigaExpandFlavour.3.desc:0 "The Vilnius region has been inhabited since ancient times, located at the confluence of the Vilnia and Neris rivers. It is believed the name Vilnius derives from the Vilnia River that flows through the city. In 1323, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania established its capital in Vilnius. The city was first mentioned in records in 1323, when Grand Duke Gediminas wrote to German cities inviting Germans and Jews to settle in the capital.\n\nAfter Riga established its governance, the city quickly built walls and rapidly developed, leveraging Riga's influence in Baltic trade. The Vilnius Jesuit University was founded. The city became highly active politically, economically, and socially. Due to its location at the junction of Eastern Europe and the Baltic, after relaxing immigration policies, Vilnius saw a large influx of immigrant groups, each contributing uniquely to the city's life, fostering prosperity in handicrafts, trade, and science.\n\nAlthough under a theocratic government, Lithuania maintained a remarkably tolerant attitude toward various religions. Vilnius is not only a multicultural city but also a multi-religious one, earning the well-known nickname 'the Jerusalem of Lithuania.' Several other religious communities also developed within the city, and Vilnius provided sanctuary to religious refugees from other regions."

RigaExpandFlavour.4.name:0 "City Log: Danzig"
RigaExpandFlavour.4.desc:0 "The city's name was established only after the investiture of Saint Adalbert in 997 AD. In the local Kashubian language, it is called Gduńsk, but due to the predominance of Germans in the city, the German name Danzig was also widely used.\n\nDanzig lies to the north, bordering the Gulf of Danzig, a semi-circular bay in the southeastern Baltic Sea, partly separated from the main Baltic by the Hel Peninsula. The Vistula River flows into the gulf, branching into many distributaries at its mouth. The city of Danzig is situated on both banks of one such distributary, the Motława River, on the left bank of the main Vistula channel. The riverbanks were the birthplace of this port city.\n\nSome scholars believe Danzig Fortress was established by Polish King Mieszko I in the 980s, while others consider 997 as the city's founding date because that year, Polish King Bolesław I the Brave sent Saint Adalbert of Prague to baptize the inhabitants of Danzig. The Duke of Pomerania's coat of arms subsequently marked Danzig as a major center under the rule of the Pomeranian dukes, a Polish fragmented duchy. The most notable duke was Świętopełk II, who granted Danzig its municipal charter around 1235 when the city had 2,000 inhabitants. By 1308, Danzig had developed into a prosperous trading city with 10,000 residents—a population size few cities could match at the time. On November 13, 1308, the Teutonic Order conquered and destroyed this thriving city, perpetrating the Danzig Massacre. This massacre led to the city's decline and sparked a series of wars between the Teutonic Knights and Poland until the Treaty of Kalisz in 1343, where the Teutonic Order acknowledged that the Pomeranian lands they occupied were held as a 'fief' from the Polish king. Despite lingering legal disputes over territorial ownership, this agreement ultimately confirmed Danzig's municipal status in 1343 and developed the trade route for Polish grain imports via the Vistula River. During the period of Teutonic control, the city's size and trade recovered and expanded, and German influence increased. In 1361, Danzig became a member of the Hanseatic League and served as the chief city of the Prussian and Livonian circles within the League, trading with Prussia, the Teutonic Order's territories along the eastern Baltic coast, Poland, and Sweden.\n\nSubsequently, Danzig changed hands repeatedly between the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order until the complete fragmentation of the Polish kingdom ended the century-long conflict over Danzig. For centuries since the Hanseatic era, Danzig has remained a vital shipping and trading center along the Baltic coast. Although it declined several times during various wars, it has always leveraged its geographical advantages to restore its former prosperity shortly after each decline. We should continue to develop and improve this city."
