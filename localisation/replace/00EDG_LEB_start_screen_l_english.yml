Emir Ibrahim was a bloodthirsty §Rtyrant§! who delighted in watching prisoners being flayed layer by layer before his eyes, enjoying the spectacle while indulging in drink. Worse still, Ibrahim Ya'qub imposed continuous and oppressive taxation upon Lebanon, plunging the local populace into misery. Muhammad al-Hariri, a Lebanese officer born of common folk, understood the people's hardships intimately. In his youth, he traveled to the Republic of §YCatalonia§!, where he gradually developed a yearning for §Trepublican governance§! and a disdain for autocratic monarchy. He believed republicanism was the best political system, the only one that could make a government accountable to its people. On a tranquil night, Muhammad al-Hariri launched a coup, imprisoned Ibrahim, and founded the Republic of Lebanon.\n\nMuhammad granted citizenship to adult property-owning men in Lebanon, empowering vast numbers of peasants and artisans with political rights for the first time. Simultaneously, he established a §YGeneral Assembly of All Lebanon§!, with representatives elected by the citizens. This assembly held the power to elect the nation's highest leader.\n\nThe republic founded by Muhammad faced numerous challenges. Under his leadership, he stabilized the domestic situation and secured autonomous status for Lebanon from the §YSakhada§! Dynasty, temporarily preserving the republican system. However, Lebanon's future is destined for turbulence. Even if the republic can manage internal conflicts, neither the rising Turkic powers to the north nor the emerging Egyptian regime in the south poised to replace the Sakhada Dynasty will allow Lebanon to remain independent for long."
