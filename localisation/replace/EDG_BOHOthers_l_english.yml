EDG_BOH_prague_clause:0 "Utraquist Four Articles"
EDG_BOH_prague_clause_desc:0 "The Utraquists, as the reformist faction within Hussitism, were primarily supported by the middle and minor nobility. Their main platform was the Four Articles of Prague, formulated by professors of Prague University.\nFirst, the Utraquists demanded the freedom to preach 'the Word of God.' The freedom they envisioned was, first and foremost, the freedom to conduct anti-Catholic propaganda while preserving a reformed Christian Church.\nSecond, the Utraquists demanded that the laity receive communion in both kinds (sub utraque specie)—the bread and the wine from the chalice—which is the origin of their name 'Utraquists' (or Calixtines). This demand reflected a distinctive aspiration of the middle class: to abolish the special status of the medieval clerical class solidified in Catholic doctrine and organization. Bourgeois notions of equality were expressed in religious guise, in the only form comprehensible to the Czech middle-class consciousness of the time. The demand for communion in both kinds was proposed by Matěj of Janov, who even attempted to implement it. Although Jan Hus did not explicitly advocate this, when many Prague priests began administering communion in both kinds to their congregations from 1414, Hus—then imprisoned in Constance—expressed approval. The practice of receiving the chalice gained support from most Hussite nobles and commoners, leading Hussites to depict the chalice on their banners, weapons, seals, etc.\nThird: Opposition to the secular authority of the clergy, thereby preventing the Church from owning property. This article expressed the demand of the middle-class opposition for a 'cheap church.' Simultaneously, the minor nobility saw this as a starting point to realize their desire to limit the privileges of the Catholic clergy. The former major nobility rejected the other articles of the Prague platform, even refusing the chalice demand, yet exploited the third article to plunder Church and monastic lands. Furthermore, the common people imbued this demand with their own content. They saw it as a powerful weapon in the struggle against the feudal ecclesiastical hierarchy and for realizing the Gospel ideals of simple living and universal equality.\nFourth: Grave offenses and all restrictions on preaching the Word of God must be punished. In the mouths of the middle class and minor nobility, this demand expressed a modest wish: to correct the faults of believers, highlight their role in feudal society, and consolidate the reformed church. Peasants and artisans added a different meaning to the fourth article, one directly aimed against feudal lords. For them, accepting this meant engaging in active struggle, physically punishing exploiters, and abolishing generations of oppression and injustice. Popular preachers interpreting this article directly called the masses to 'draw the sword' and 'cleanse God's vineyard,' aiming not only to renew the church but to transform the entire social structure on a new foundation.\nDue to their lack of precise definition, the Four Articles of Prague could be accepted by both the Utraquists and the Orthodox faction (i.e., the Taborites). However, the Utraquists used the Prague Articles to limit their entire platform, whereas for the Taborites, these articles were merely the first step toward realizing their ideals. Moreover, the Taborite and Utraquist interpretations of these four articles were fundamentally different."

EDG_BOH_commune_of_tabor:0 "Tábor Commune"
EDG_BOH_commune_of_tabor_desc:0 "The fundamental tenet of the Hussite Orthodox faction (i.e., the Taborites) was the doctrine of the Millennium—a thousand years of peace inherited from medieval popular heresies, commonly known as millenarianism. Among medieval revolutionary sects, the prevalent belief was premillennialism: they believed Christ would return to earth a second time and establish a kingdom of happiness and justice directly ruled by God. This characterized the views of the core peasant and commoner masses within the Taborite camp.\n\nThe Taborites asserted that a world built on exploitation could not endure; the millennium-long Kingdom of Justice would soon be realized. Then, on earth, 'there will be no kings, no rulers and subjects, all taxes and duties will be abolished, violence will be eradicated, and people will live together as brothers and sisters. Private property will cease to exist, so all who possess property shall be condemned to death.'\n\nThe Taborites attempted to establish a society that vaguely resembled their vision. Even during the initial mountain gatherings, elements of material distribution emerged spontaneously. Many peasants, leaving home for days, would bring provisions; upon reaching the gathering place, they pooled all food supplies for collective use. During the course of the peasant war, especially in its early stages, the Taborites strove to implement this principle of absolute equality among all rebels. This principle was particularly evident in the organization at Tábor itself, where the rebel peasants sought to create a social structure where terms like 'mine' and 'yours' were unnecessary. Anyone arriving in Tábor with money had to deposit it into the common treasury—often a large barrel placed in the square. All goods captured from the enemy were treated as communal property, managed by the commander and distributed as required to each unit or fighter. All who came to Tábor called themselves brothers and sisters. Class distinctions were abolished. Women in Tábor were no longer in a subordinate position; on the contrary, many women were active combatants in Taborite forces. The entire membership of the Tábor Commune was divided into two halves: one half remained in a constant state of combat readiness, while the other half engaged in productive activities, quickly establishing production on the necessary scale for weapons, equipment, ammunition, and transport.\n\nThe Tábor Commune was governed by commanders elected by the general assembly of the Taborites. Commanders held their positions for life, with full military authority; particularly significant issues concerning all of Tábor were sometimes resolved in general assemblies. Numerous towns and villages across Bohemia pledged allegiance to the Taborites. Regional communes united to form special alliances—'brotherhoods.' These communes were obliged to implement the resolutions of the Taborites and their commanders on all fundamental matters.\n\nAlthough the Taborites displayed strong republican tendencies, only the most radical among them considered themselves republicans. Overall, the Taborite social structure remained dominated by 'theology,' with their ideal societal model being a theocratic commune system akin to the 'Millennial Kingdom.'"

EDG_BOH_picart_commune:0 "Picart Commune"
EDG_BOH_picart_commune_desc:0 "The original idealistic significance of the Hussite movement did not vanish immediately from all its participants. Far from everyone could become a master craftsman or manage their own farm. The majority of peasants and urban poor were not only the most active combatants in the armed struggle but also represented the most revolutionary ideology. The urban and rural poor formed 'sects of popular revolutionary, evangelical communist republics.' These sects had various names, but those holding extreme millenarian views were often called Picarts, sometimes Adamites.\n\nEarly key leaders of the Picarts included priests such as Petr Kániš, Jan Bydlín, and Martin Húska. The Picarts steadfastly adhered to the early Taborite millenarian doctrine, yet their religious views contained materialist elements. They opposed all exploitation and violence. The society envisioned by the Picarts was one without any property, where all lived as brothers. The Picarts called the Pope the 'chief of heathens,' rejected all church organizations, labeled churches 'dens of robbers,' and monasteries 'brothels.' Picart thinkers even opposed the Eucharist, which was accepted by the other Taborites.\n\nThe most extreme and thoroughgoing Picarts of this time already attempted to realize their ideals. They not only negated property but also the family, considering all individual plans and actions sinful, while only things created communally were sinless. They spoke of living in the 'sinless Kingdom of Heaven.' Their enemies accused them of walking the streets unclothed and practicing free love. Picart thinkers preached that neither God nor the Devil existed; God lived in the hearts of the good, and the Devil in the hearts of the wicked. They considered themselves immortal, comparable to Christ, whom they saw as merely an ordinary man.\n\nThe views of the Picarts contained notable materialist elements, which frightened many peasants bound by religious prejudice, who saw these ideas as blasphemous and insulting to religion. Consequently, although the social aspects of Picart doctrine did garner sympathy from the urban and rural poor, their numbers remained small. At critical junctures, the Picarts failed to gain widespread popular support. The ideals of the Picarts far exceeded the possibilities of their era, being unrealizable not only in the 15th century but even to this day. §RThe failure of the Picarts was inevitable§!.\n\nYet the Picarts' struggle was not without trace. The dream of human equality and a society without exploitation inspired the Czech peasants' struggle. By proposing goals unattainable under the conditions of the time, it greatly invigorated their strength to fight for immediate tasks—significant stages in the long-term struggle of laborers to build a classless society. The distant ideals of the Picarts helped the masses thoroughly address the immediate tasks of their struggle."

There, they held open-air sermons and worship services, administering the Eucharist according to Hussite rites. Peasants listened to the impassioned speeches and calls of the People's Preachers on the mountaintops. These preachers also used allegorical tales, various prophecies, and other didactic means to reach the people. Under the conditions of the time, these were highly effective methods through which the masses began to understand the necessity and imperative of active struggle against a sinful world. Many preachers openly called to 'wash one's hands in the blood of the unbelievers.' The Uphill campaigns strengthened connections between villages and districts. The peasant gatherings on mountains served as training for combat organizations, forming the nuclei of future peasant forces. The preaching aroused and nurtured feelings of class solidarity, fortifying the peasants' resolve against feudal oppression. Sometimes, groups of peasants did not leave the gathering sites, staying for days in tents or outdoors. Participants called themselves brothers and sisters. They shared food and clothing among themselves, thereby laying the groundwork for the principles of consumer communism later practiced by the Taborites. Simultaneously, the Uphill campaigns demonstrated the broad influence of revolutionary propaganda in religious forms upon the peasant masses under the conditions of that era."
