EDG_Mission_ARL_1_4_desc:0 "The Caucasus has always been the backyard of the Persians, but this region has long been fragmented, chaotic, and easily defensible. We need the bravest soldiers to defeat the enemies there."

EDG_Mission_ARL_1_6_desc:0 "Due to the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid dynasty in West Asia, a great battle erupted at Chaldiran. We must achieve victory and strangle Ottoman power in Anatolia."

EDG_Mission_ARL_1_8_desc:0 "As early as the classical era, Persians once set foot on the Balkan Peninsula. Today, the iron hooves of the King of Kings will once again trample the lands of the Greeks."

EDG_Mission_ARL_1_10_desc:0 "The Alawites have long held widespread influence in West Asia, with an increasingly profound impact after the 16th century. We should consider our relationship with them."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_1_title:0 "Formation of the Qizilbash"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_1_desc:0 "In the spring of 1500, Ismail captured Ardabil. He immediately sent messengers to contact the Qizilbash tribes in Syria and Anatolia, summoning them to gather at Erzincan on the Armenian Plateau. On his march, an army of Turkmens from the Bayburtlu tribe came to join him. When he reached Erzincan, a total of 7,000 warriors from tribes such as Ustajlu, Shamlu, Rumlu, Takkalu, Zu’l-Qadar, Afshar, Qajar, and Varsaq awaited his arrival. These tribes formed the earliest Qizilbash."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_2_title:0 "Taking Tabriz"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_2_desc:0 "Tabriz, founded in the 3rd century BC, has historically served as the capital of multiple dynasties. In ancient times, it was a hub of communication from all directions, holding significant military and transportation importance. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu confederations established by Central Asian Turkmen tribes, as well as the Persian-founded Safavid dynasty, all successively made Tabriz their capital."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_3_title:0 "Integrating the Maragha Ghazis" # Integration of the Maragha Ghazis
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_3_desc:0 "The Maragha Order is another Shia order, composed of Islamic clerics and Ghazis. Integrating this vibrant order into the Safavid organization will provide us with more resources and support."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_5_title:0 "Shia Activities"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_5_desc:0 "The majority of the people under Ismail's rule belonged to the Sunni sect, with over two-thirds of the population in the capital Tabriz being Sunni Muslims. The Safavid Order, however, was a Sufi order mixed with various religious elements, its doctrine reflecting more of a fanaticism useful for swaying hearts and minds but of little benefit for governing a state. Particularly among some extremists within the Qizilbash, who viewed Ismail as a god and prophet, they would pillage Iranian towns while shouting his name. Ismail executed some of them on charges of robbery and murder, while many others were sent to Anatolia, handed over to local Safavid Order agents to continue managing them according to the old order's ways—raiding villages, attacking armies, and creating chaos within the heart of the Ottoman Empire. Domestically, to more effectively control the Qizilbash and return to an "orthodox" faith became Ismail's primary task. He did not convert to Sunni Islam but instead chose the minority sect in Iran—the Twelver Shia branch—as the official faith of his state. His advisors urged him to reconsider to avoid inciting popular revolt. But Ismail pushed aside dissenting opinions and publicly announced this decision during the next Khutbah, declaring that the Shia Shahada "Ali is the Wali of Allah" would be added to future Friday prayer sermons. Qizilbash soldiers, as ordered by Ismail, mingled among the crowd, apprehending any opponents or suspicious individuals making unusual moves. To consolidate his rule, Ismail began to forcibly promote the Shia faith within his realm through "iron and blood."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_7_title:0 "Destroy the Aq Qoyunlu"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_7_desc:0 "The successors of Uzun Hasan are incompetent and selfish. Ismail I also possesses the bloodline of Uzun Hasan, giving him the right to destroy the Aq Qoyunlu and inherit Uzun Hasan's empire."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_9_title:0 "Support of the Sufis"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_9_desc:0 "Sufism holds widespread influence in the Iranian region. Winning over our Islamic allies will provide us with more opportunities to connect with Iran's Sufis."

EDG_Mission_ARL_2_10_title:0 "Voice of the Twelvers"
EDG_Mission_ARL_2_10_desc:0 "The sacred lineage and legends of the Safavid family began with Ismail and became an 'acknowledged fact' by the time of his son, Tahmasp. Although most Iranians at the time were Sunnis, they generally held sympathy and respect for Ali and his descendants, especially since the mother of the Fourth Imam was a princess of the last Sasanian dynasty. This carried a strong affinity for Iranians who revered 'noble bloodlines,' which may be one reason Ismail chose the Twelver sect."

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_2_title:0 "Sheikh of All Azerbaijan"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_2_desc:0 "With our conquest of Azerbaijan, we have become the sole and truly orthodox Sheikh of Azerbaijan. Now it is time to set our sights further afield.

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_4_title:0 "Consolidating Power"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_4_desc:0 "With our further religious infiltration and propagation in Persia, our faith has gradually become the orthodox belief across the entire Persian region.

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_7_title:0 "Proselytize the Levant"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_7_desc:0 "With our complete occupation of Iraq, we can begin to look upon the territories of the Levant.

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_9_title:0 "Chastise the Mahdi"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_9_desc:0 "The Almohad Caliphate claims to be the Mahdi; they are usurpers of Allah's will, committing vile deeds under the name of the Mahdi.

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_10_title:0 "Purify Iberia"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_10_desc:0 "Iberia was once Muslim territory, with the call to prayer echoing from minarets across the land. Now, those despicable Christians have gradually encroached upon our territories, leading Iberia to revert to a false religion. We shall reclaim this land, and the decree of Allah shall resonate across this earth once again."

EDG_Mission_ARL_3_11_title:0 "The Legacy of Ali"
EDG_Mission_ARL_3_11_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Ali, the only rightful successor of the Prophet Muhammad, was assassinated by treacherous usurpers. Centuries later, the inheritor of Ali's will has risen from Azerbaijan, bringing his legacy back to the entire Islamic world. The Islamic world is reunified, this time in the name of Ali."

EDG_Mission_ARL_4_1_desc:0 "The Safavid Order was born in the early 14th century during the Ilkhanate rule, originating in Ardabil on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea.

EDG_Mission_ARL_4_5_title:0 "Overlooking Persia"
EDG_Mission_ARL_4_5_desc:0 "With our further conquests in northern Persia, we gain the opportunity to overlook the entirety of Persia. This ancient land was once filled with heroic tales of all kinds. However, Persia is now rotten, engulfed in the flames of war. We will put an end to all this and restore Persia to its former glory. For the newly established Safavid Dynasty, the first priority is to build an effective state system. Its predecessor, the Safavid Order, had never actually administered any region. Therefore, the early Safavid Dynasty largely absorbed the state institutions of the Aq Qoyunlu wholesale. Building on this, due to the immense contributions made by the Qizilbash tribes in the founding of the Safavid Dynasty, in return, the emirs, nobles, and soldiers of these tribes were granted special status within the new state."

EDG_Mission_ARL_5_2_title:0 "Unite Gilan"
EDG_Mission_ARL_5_2_desc:0 "Gilan has always been our historical ally, contributing significant strength to our nation throughout the long course of history.

EDG_Mission_ARL_5_4_title:0 "The Living Imam"
EDG_Mission_ARL_5_4_desc:0 "With the widespread propagation of the Safavid Order, to enhance our legitimacy, we can proclaim that we are the living successors of the true Imam.

EDG_Mission_ARL_5_6_title:0 "Master of Iran"
EDG_Mission_ARL_5_6_desc:0 "With our gradual conquest of the Timurid Empire, we now hold all of Iran. We shall turn our gaze to lands beyond, where many misguided Muslims still follow incorrect faiths and leadership. We must liberate them. Iran will never be our final destination."

EDG_Mission_ARL_5_8_title:0 "Invade India"
EDG_Mission_ARL_5_8_desc:0 "With our complete conquest of Khorasan, it is time to turn our attention to the land known as India. Here lie numerous infidel and heretical lords, engaged in ceaseless, endless warfare. We shall bring them order. We shall become the masters of all Hindustan."

EDG_Mission_ARL_5_10_title:0 "Invade the Mandalas"
EDG_Mission_ARL_5_10_desc:0 "The term 'Mandala' originally meant 'circle' or 'gathering' in Sanskrit, the language of the false Buddha. Today, the infidels of southeastern India use it to refer to their foolish and unstable tributary system. With our full control over India, it is time to consider the next phase of expansion. We shall cross the Arakan Mountains and march against the infidels to the southeast."
