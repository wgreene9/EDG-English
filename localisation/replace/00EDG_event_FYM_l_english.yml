He was once framed by Ahmad Rosetta as the murderer of the imperial heir, Muhammad al-Sahada, leading to his exile. Ahmad even presented Safar I with an opened vial of poison, claiming it was what killed Muhammad. Safar I fed this poison to a condemned prisoner in the dungeons; the prisoner died with symptoms identical to Muhammad's. Shattered by the tragedy of fratricide, Safar I's mental fortitude broke. He could not forgive his son's killer, yet could not bear to see another son die. Despite Zayd's vigorous self-defense, as the primary beneficiary of his elder brother's death, the suspicion against him was never fully erased. Ultimately, Safar I exiled the prince to a distant desert far from Egypt. During his exile, Zayd became a mercenary in the Mashriq region, leading a company of Turkmens and Persians, campaigning north and south. He gained extensive military experience and built his own military force. When the Malik War erupted, Zayd returned to his father's side, assisting him in quelling the conflict and restoring the empire's order.\n\nIn the final years of Safar I's reign, Zayd effectively governed the entire empire in place of his gravely ill father, remaining steadfastly dutiful. After Safar I's death, Zayd, amidst the support of his officials and as the unquestioned heir, successfully ascended the throne, becoming the empire's new Grand Malik. His rule was iron-fisted; for a considerable period, he implemented numerous reforms that transformed the Sahada Empire's previously decentralized political structure. His early years of wandering in Persia and Anatolia exposed him to the sufferings of the common people and bred a deep disdain for the corruption pervasive throughout the empire. He realized the Malik War's outbreak was due not only to the expansion of regional power but also to the internal decay and depravity of the imperial structure. To combat this, he rigorously overhauled the administration, severely punishing corrupt officials. Holding fast to the Sahada family motto, 'Mercy is the most dangerous poison,' he showed no leniency towards his enemies or corrupt subordinates. He incorporated punishments like flaying, dismemberment by carts, and lingchi (death by a thousand cuts)—methods used since Safar I's time—into the imperial penal code. He also innovated numerous torture methods, creating new ones by combining multiple applicable tortures, such as reducing a prisoner to a human stump before executing them by impalement, finally leaving the body exposed in the marketplaces."

EDG_flavor_FYM.10.title:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]"
EDG_flavor_FYM.10.desc:0 "Though the territories of the Sahada Empire were vast and boundless, not every Sahada prince was fortunate enough to become the empire's heir. Like the Padishahs of Turkey, the Grand Malik of Sahada maintained a large and splendid harem, and it was the norm for his bloodline to flourish abundantly. Every prince of modest capability would be appointed by the Grand Malik to various provinces of the empire, serving there as Prince-Governors to hone their administrative skills and cultivate their own factions. However, most Sahada princes were destined never to become the supreme Grand Malik of the empire and were highly likely to become casualties of political strife once their brothers ascended the throne.\n\nIdris al-Hayis came from the periphery of the royal family. His father was the seventh son of Zayd, appointed as Governor of Yemen during Sultan Zayd's reign. Idris himself received the finest education in Zayd's court. Greek mercenaries from the Nomos and Mamluks greatly influenced him; he was not skilled at composing elegant Persian poetry, despised the hypocritical, pedantic scribes, and immensely admired the Emirs who campaigned north and south. He gradually revealed tendencies favoring violence and an iron fist. From a young age, Idris was utterly obsessed with the supreme power of the Grand Malik, viewing his grandfather, Sultan Zayd, as his role model. Upon reaching adulthood, Idris was briefly appointed as the Emir of Medina. He applied himself diligently to governance, frequently organizing hunts and military drills. During his administration of Medina, he forged good relationships with many Emirs of the Hashemite family and the Saudi family of Nejd, laying a solid foundation for establishing a stable power base in the region.\n\nDespite Idris's outstanding abilities, his position in the line of succession was extremely low, and his future seemed destined to be far from the glory of the throne. However, Allah and the illustrious spirit of Nasir I had not abandoned him. The empire did not attain permanent stability after the Grand Malik War. The civil war instigated by the Abbasid Caliph shattered the empire's peace; warlords across the land once again paid lip service to central orders while acting independently, and the shadow of the Malik War loomed once more over the empire's dome.\n\nIdris initially had no intention of involving himself in this power game, but his wisdom and courage gradually won recognition from his advisors and loyal followers. They convinced Idris that, as a scion of the royal bloodline, he had a duty to protect the nation from division and foreign threats. After leading his personal troops to repel the Caliph's forces multiple times, Idris gained immense prestige. His heroic bearing on the battlefield reminded many of his grandfather Zayd, and his political acumen was equally sharp. He skillfully allied with the military and local nobles, gradually weakening the power of other competitors, and step by step secured the empire's highest authority, concurrently holding the titles of Swordbearer Emir and Grand Vizier of the empire.\n\nAfter Idris seized power, the Sahada armies once again became an ever-victorious force. More importantly, Idris's influence had begun to surpass that of the reigning Malik. Many Emirs and Mamluks began discussing having Idris seize power and become the empire's ruler. In this situation, Idris lived up to expectations, seized the empire's supreme authority, and declared himself the inheritor of Nasir I's legacy. The Mamluks and Ulama bestowed upon him the title 'Sultanus-al-Saladin', meaning 'Sultan of Sultans'."

Utilizing their resources and community networks, they suppressed other merchants, ruthlessly exploited urban artisans, and engaged in widespread bribery, leading to rampant corruption among officials. For a time, even the Grand Malik felt powerless against their pernicious influence. During the Malik War, these treacherous Jewish merchants committed every conceivable evil; they desecrated not only mosques but also Christian churches, and even bribed local Qadis to implement Jewish law in the regions. Muslims decried the multitude of sins committed by these Jews, and the Copts repeatedly petitioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to issue a decree to put all these Jews to death.\n\nHowever, during the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Jewish problem was finally resolved. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the arrest of all implicated Jews and their families across the nation and their deportation to Jerusalem. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had no intention of putting them on trial; their arrogance and greed during the Malik War had already filled him with utter disgust. To prevent the Jews from bribing the Qadis and to satisfy the Copts and other merchants within the country, [Root.Monarch.GetName] passed judgment: all implicated Jews and their family members were sentenced to capital punishment.\n\nOn the first day, thousands of Jews were stripped naked and placed in cangues. Each Jew's left arm was pierced by a red-hot iron nail, the other end of which was connected to the right arm of the next Jew, forming a long chain composed of thousands of Jews and heavy iron links. Regardless of gender or age, they were driven in turn to the Western Wall. Before reaching it, each received lashings on the back with iron-tipped whips, leaving everyone bloody, mangled, and screaming in agony. At the Western Wall, their right hands were chopped off. This execution process lasted the entire day, and the pile of severed hands before the Wall formed a small pyramid. The residents of all Jerusalem came to watch, their cheers and jubilation ringing to the heavens; among them were many who had suffered persecution and exploitation at the hands of these Jews during the Malik War, some even having lost loved ones to their torture and murder.\n\nOn the second day, under the scorching sun, the executioners laid out vast areas of iron spikes in the square and used spears to force the Jews to walk over them. Many, already weakened from the previous day's torment, fainted under the blistering sun. Their fellow Jews, also suffering, showed no sympathy, leaving their countrymen to collapse onto the spike-covered ground, watching as these fellow 'Chosen People' were pierced through their torsos or even skulls by the spikes. They then dragged the bodies of the unconscious across the ground of spikes and gravel, concerned only with escaping the sun themselves. So many died that day, especially women, the elderly, and children. By evening, many of the Jews were mangled beyond recognition.\n\nOn the third day, the surviving Jews were dragged to the square. After having their limbs amputated and having molten copper poured into their abdomens, they were executed by impalement.\n\nThat day, the birds chirped, and the citizens cheered and rejoiced."

EDG_flavor_FYM_mission.0.desc:0 "The Sahada dynasty originated as a minor power in the Yemen region. In 1342, the militarily proficient Nasir I ascended as Malik of the Sahada dynasty. Though only 22 years old at the time, his bravery in battle and skill in appointing capable men were already renowned. Nasir unified Yemen by 1356 and gradually launched conquests of surrounding areas. He entered the political power struggles of the Arabian region, filling the local power vacuum. The rule of the Sahada dynasty was highly decentralized, with local areas retaining significant autonomy, which also facilitated the dynasty's rapid expansion. By 1374, Nasir I had become a regional power in Arabia, controlling nearly half of the Arabian Peninsula's territory.\nIn 1380, the last Bahri Sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Hajji II, was expelled from Cairo. However, the Burji faction failed to quickly control the situation, triggering a civil war among the Mamluks. The intense conflict between the two sides caused severe damage to Egypt's economy. The Bahri Sultan al-Hajji II sought aid from the Sahada dynasty, promising to cede territories in southwestern Arabia to the Grand Malik Nasir I and provide substantial annual tribute. After careful consideration, the 60-year-old Nasir I recognized this as the best birthday gift bestowed by Allah, and led his army into Egypt. However, after helping the Bahri Sultan quell the rebellion, Nasir I turned his forces against the Bahri regime itself, ultimately supplanting the Mamluks to become the Grand Malik of Egypt, establishing a powerful polity spanning Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula once more in the world.\nYet the Sahada dynasty's rule was highly unstable. While seemingly at its peak, the empire was actually precarious. The military nobility within the empire still held immense power; Emirs in regions like Syria possessed great autonomy, and many Arabian tribes continuously sought independence.\nTo maintain the support of various domestic factions and their allegiance to the Sahada dynasty, Sultan Nasir I promulgated the 'Buhayra Act' in 1390. This act clearly defined the political and economic privileges enjoyed by various interest groups, embedding feudal relations into the very marrow of the Sahada Empire. The imperial military-administrative system was built upon the feudal relationships between the Egyptian Mamluks and the tribal confederations of Arabia. A tax-farming system was implemented nationwide, requiring local Emirs and Sheikhs to pay tribute and provide military service to the Sahada Sultan, who in turn would not excessively interfere in local affairs. The Mamluk faction played a crucial, even pivotal, role within the empire. Both the Bahri and Burji Mamluk factions controlled significant political and military resources and possessed their own feudal economic bases, long posing a major threat to the Sahada Sultan—yet simultaneously, they were the military force the Sultan relied upon most. Gaining the support of the Egyptian Mamluks was the most critical task for every Sahada Sultan upon their accession."

EDG_flavor_FYM_mission.1.desc:0 "Since the death of Nasir I in 1391, the Sahada dynasty has faced continuous rebellion and instability. The Sultan of Sahada at this time was the equally astute Muhammad I. As Nasir I's fourth and only surviving son, Muhammad I was naturally gifted and had long accompanied his father in military campaigns and state affairs, equipping him to handle the crises confronting the Sahada dynasty and preventing the already crumbling empire from collapsing under its own weight. Under Muhammad I's governance, although the Sahada Empire remained somewhat turbulent, the economy and culture in Egypt continued to flourish. Because the Sahada dynasty adhered to Shiite Islam while the majority of Muslims in its territories were Sunni, the dynasty was compelled to adopt a policy of religious tolerance. This very atmosphere of openness and inclusivity during the Sahada period made the capital, Faiyum, one of the academic centers of the Islamic world. Scholars from the Maghreb and Persia came to lecture and exchange ideas in local mosques, significantly fostering cultural development in Egypt. However, after Muhammad's death, the Sahada Empire, now in the hands of his successor Safar I, seemed unable to sustain itself.\n\nMeanwhile, an Emir family based in the Rosetta region of the Nile Delta gradually expanded their influence within the Sahada dynasty, becoming known as the 'Rosetta family.' By mediating between the Bahri and Burji factions, the Rosetta family gained immense influence in Egypt, emerging as a key player in the Sahada dynasty's political games within the region.\n\nWhile relying on the Egyptian Mamluks and Arabian tribal confederations, the Sahada dynasty also attempted to introduce external forces to balance domestic powers. These included Greek Orthodox mercenaries, Coptic bureaucrats, and Turkmen mercenary regiments from the north. The Turkmen regiments played a vital role in both the dynasty's military campaigns and its efforts to maintain internal stability.\n\nThe empire had two heads: one was the spiritual capital, Sahada, the ancient capital believed to be the city where Shem, son of Noah, resided, housing the empire's glorious past; the other was the practical head, with the Nile as its lifeblood. Connecting these two heads to the body called the empire was a narrow, elongated route. This path served both as a trade route along the Red Sea and as a link connecting Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem—the three holy cities representing the Prophet's life—symbolizing the empire's prosperity and strength. Yet, all this seemed incredibly fragile in the face of the underlying crises now plaguing the empire."

EDG_flavor_FYM_mission.2.desc:0 "Since the ascension of Safar I, the Sahada Empire has been mired in chaos, unable to extricate itself. The rapid expansion of the Sahada dynasty was not matched by the establishment of a stable, long-term administrative system, leaving the empire's foundations profoundly insecure. Central control over the provinces was weak: the Bedouin Sheikhs of the Arabian Peninsula were merely loosely governed, enjoying extensive autonomy; the vast majority of land in Egypt remained in the hands of Sunni imams and Mamluks, who controlled significant resources, concealed land and population records, and held many key official posts; the Abbasid Caliph, heavily guarded by Sunni believers, became a banner for Sunnis across the realm to oppose the Shiite Sahada dynasty, leading to frequent anti-Malik riots in Cairo, forcing the Sahada rulers to move the capital further south to Faiyum; the Emirs brought from Yemen harbored their own schemes, holding military and political power while colluding with other factions. They enjoyed the privileges of Yemeni warlords within the imperial court while leveraging the resources of other local powers, appearing loyal to the Grand Malik on the surface but already stirring restlessly in the shadows. Many had secretly become allies of the Abbasid Caliph. Should the empire's rule in Egypt collapse, they would likely immediately declare conversion to Sunni Islam and turn their blades against their former master—the most prominent representative of these Yemeni families being the Rosetta clan.\n\nAhmad Rosetta's veins flowed with the blood of the Prophet Muhammad. As a revered Sayyid, he received the finest education from childhood and could recite the Quran from memory. Ahmad learned early to cloak himself in humility, making himself appear non-threatening among the Mamluks and other military nobles, yet all the while harboring soaring ambitions. In his youth, Ahmad campaigned with Muhammad I, deeply impressed by this brave and wise Sultan. He knew well he could never surpass his sovereign and resigned himself to serving him faithfully for the rest of Muhammad's life, eventually being appointed Grand Vizier by Muhammad I. After Muhammad I's death, Ahmad Rosetta spent several years cautiously observing his new liege. Once finally certain of the possibility of pursuing his own grand designs, Ahmad began quietly building his own faction. Respected for his virtue and illustrious military achievements, he became a figure whom both the Bahri and Burji factions were willing to compromise with and obey. Now holding the position of Grand Vizier, he had become one of the greatest threats to the Grand Malik.\n\nAs the Sahada family motto declares—'Mercy is the most dangerous poison, blood is the most beautiful pigment'—if [Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to avert the empire's impending doom, he must possess sufficient ruthlessness and strength to permanently eradicate all his enemies from the very flesh and bone of the empire."

Just yesterday, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had again acquiesced to Bahri's execution of one of the former's trusted slaves and personally toasted Bahri's military achievements in quelling a rebellion at a banquet. Now, Muhammad al-Bahri considered himself the empire's foremost figure after the Grand Vizier. Answering the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s summons, he arrived completely unprepared.\nBut the moment he stepped into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, he was swiftly struck on the back of the head with iron clubs by Turkic mercenaries from Anatolia stationed on either side. After a brief dizziness, he found himself disarmed, tightly bound, and dragged to the steps before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s throne. Seated high upon the throne was the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the Chief Prosecutor to read aloud Bahri's crimes, a process that lasted a full thirteen minutes. By the time Bahri's mind had fully cleared from the assault, he was hauled before a large cauldron filled with boiling water. Despite Muhammad al-Bahri's desperate pleas for mercy, even begging to be reduced to slavery,\nAt the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s command, Bahri's limbs were severed in the great hall, his tongue cut out with a dagger. His blood gradually stained the opulent floor, and his agonized screams echoed relentlessly in the vast space of the court. To prevent Bahri from bleeding to death too quickly, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s torturers poured molten copper onto the stumps of his limbs and pierced his shoulders with two long, thin iron rods. He was then suspended by chains over the boiling water, subjected to waves of scalding steam. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] drank his wine with satisfaction and had Bahri's freshly severed tongue fed to his favorite hound. Once Bahri nearly lost consciousness, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lost interest and ordered him submerged into the boiling water.\nThe court was left with only the lingering, heart-rending screams of Bahri."

History knows him as 'Stephen of Cloyes,' who asserted he received a divine revelation from Jesus instructing him to raise a crusade. In the spring of 1221, the Children's Crusade marched south through Switzerland, bypassing Cathar territories, and sailed from Genoa. Their goal was not to sail directly to Egypt but to seize Tunisia as a springboard for attacking Egypt. Mired in Moroccan conflicts, the Almohad Caliphate could offer little substantial aid to Tunisia beyond dispatching a small force of over a thousand men, viewing both the Hafsids entrenched in Tunisia and the Crusaders with equal distaste, adopting a largely hands-off attitude. In the winter of 1121, Kairouan fell. The city's Great Mosque was plundered by the Crusaders, and the spiritual heart of North African Muslims flew the banner of Christendom. However, after capturing Tunisia, a major split occurred within the Crusader ranks. The Knights Templar advocated for seizing Tripoli and Benghazi along the coast from Tunisia to open a path to Egypt, a logical best route according to their commanders. Meanwhile, Stephen of Cloyes and the mercenaries hired by the French king argued for using their naval superiority to land directly in Alexandria, bypassing the main Ayyubid army. Unfortunately, the Children's Crusade actually captured Alexandria Port. Fortunately, General Sayf al-Din Ali's Mamluks recaptured Alexandria, instantly reversing the war's momentum. It was no longer the Muslims but the Christians who were cut off. The Crusaders, just moments ago immersed in joy, suddenly faced annihilation. The mercenary leaders finally agreed to withdraw to the Christians' last stronghold in the Levant—Acre. However, unwilling to abandon the wealth they had looted from Egypt, wagons laden with silks and jewels severely slowed their retreat. The mercenaries were overtaken west of Suez. Regrettably, they were not Moses, and the pursuing Mamluks would not be swallowed by the Red Sea like Pharaoh in the Bible. When news arrived of the total annihilation of the seaborne Crusade, the Knights Templar were just one step from capturing Benghazi. But the weary defenders, heartened by the Mamluk victory, rallied, while the Templars outside the walls faltered. Ultimately, the Knights abandoned the siege of Benghazi, ending the 'French Crusade' in an anticlimax. As agreed, Stephen of Cloyes and the Grand Master of the Templars divided the lands with Djerba Island as the boundary. The lands north of the island went to the Kingdom of Tunisia, where Stephen of Cloyes would be king, while the lands south were under the Templars' control. But the fate of this Children's Crusade was finally sealed; they could no longer threaten the Islamic world. The entire Islamic world rejoiced, and many Muslim states sent envoys hoping we would execute these Christians with extreme punishments or force them to convert to Islam."

The influence of the White Sheep dynasty in Aleppo has almost completely dissipated, and the minor Beyliks have been nearly absorbed. Now, the barrier before us is Anatolia. Although no powerful force here can truly stop us—the Ottoman dynasty in Rumelia seems as insignificant as ants in our eyes, and the Byzantines and Bulgarians certainly lack Allah's protection—it is clear that we should currently focus our military efforts on the Iraq region rather than the wilds of Anatolia.

The Mamluks' chieftains and the Abbasid Caliph stirred one bloodstorm after another; dark crimson blood flowed into the Nile until the river itself carried a metallic scent. Amidst the grasses lining each imperial highway of Sahada, sinister bones lay hidden. Once-bustling cities lay lifeless, survivors trembling daily at every sound. But most of the time, they could not escape the blades of Mamluk and Bedouin raiders. The Egyptian mother river, Nile, symbolizing the sun god, became more terrifying than the Styx. Within many cities, only macabre pyramids of skulls remained, picked clean by ants. The empire's elites battled like Abyssinian lion prides, fighting for the sole throne, the lives and legacies of the losers cast into the flowing waters...\n\nYet, just as the sun sets over the Cyrenaican desert only to rise again east of Sinai, the night of unrestrained killing passes. Fortunately, the warlords' free-for-all has ended. The scimitar was not laid down; the Grand Malik of the Sahada dynasty has grasped it anew, and this time, the ruler of Sahada will never relinquish it.\nThose survivors who endured the rebellion finally faced their Judgment Day. When the reckoning came, what awaited them was retribution more terrible than the worst they could imagine. For [Root.Monarch.GetName], letting them die swiftly would be the greatest mercy, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not merciful, as the Sahada family motto declares, 'Mercy is the most dangerous poison'...\n\nCastration into slavery, smashing teeth, and severing limbs were only the beginning of ending the rebels' capacity to resist. For several mornings before their execution, the jailers would rouse the once-arrogant Emirs and Mamluks directly from sleep, driving iron nails into their limbless, naked bodies, forcing them to witness their wives and children tortured with branding irons, flaying knives, and boiling water until they lost consciousness, even life, making them wail in agony, scream insanely, and weep bitterly for their past crimes, regretting they were ever born. Luckier prisoners, after having their eyes, noses, and tongues gouged out, would be thrown by executioners into scalding water, pulled out just as they were about to expire, and then have molten iron poured over their entire bodies. Until death, it was nearly impossible to determine whether the condemned were still alive or merely twitching corpses.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] himself greatly enjoyed sitting upon his ornate, plush throne, savoring peacocks from Persia and wine from Valencia while admiring these former enemies' torture, listening to the symphony woven from their hellish screams—a sublime ode performed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s foes, the finest praise for the empire's iron fist and might, a paean to the eternal Sahada Empire, and a hymn to the supreme Grand Malik, the sun over this land.\n\nThe sun of Sahada will never set."

For Ahmad, rescuing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from the Mamluk siege apparently held little importance. His Majesty the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become a true loner. His most trusted eldest son, Muhammad, was poisoned and died young; for years, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] never recovered from the mysterious death of his heir. His second son, the talented Zayd, was exiled after being implicated in a court scandal, accused of gross disrespect.\nFor a long time, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] did not publicly disclose the reason for his second son's exile—only a few knew Prince Zayd was reported by Ahmad Rosetta for allegedly poisoning his brother. Ahmad even presented a vial of opened poison to His Majesty, claiming it was what killed Muhammad. His Majesty fed this poison to a condemned prisoner in the dungeons; the prisoner died with symptoms identical to Muhammad's. Shattered by the tragedy of fratricide, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s mental fortitude broke. He could not forgive his son's killer yet could not bear to see another son die.

The Caliph bribed a group of opportunists among the Mamluks, attempting to have them swear allegiance in the name of Allah.

'You cannot take him; this place will be your grave!'\n'If you dare attack, I will kill him instantly.'\n'If you dared do that, you would have done it already,' the Mamluk mocked.

Though he could only wield his blade one-handed, he still cut down several Mamluk guards. But the Mamluks' assault was too fierce; the whirl of blades and shadows made it impossible for him to focus—the scene was too perilous. He couldn't trust anyone but himself to safely escape while holding the infant. Yet, even with such martial prowess, a Mamluk struck his left arm unexpectedly, causing him to drop the infant involuntarily.\n'No!' By the time he noticed, the infant had been seized by the Mamluks.\n'Retrieve that infant!' Zayd ignored the deep wound on his left arm, cut down two more enemies, and commanded his men.\nBut when he saw the infant again, Abu Ibrahim was already holding him, mounting a warhorse ready to flee.\nWhen Zayd looked at the infant one last time, he saw his face—childlike, fair, yet covered in blood—and wearing a smile that did not belong to an infant.\nAt that moment, he believed he would regret it."

The empire's low-level officials were already corrupt, and during the great chaos of the Malik War, the empire's rotten roots were laid bare.\n\nIn a small town in the Eastern Province lived a poor scholar named Ahmad. His wife died early, leaving a young daughter, Afamia. Lacking funds to study in Cairo, Ahmad decided to entrust Afamia to a local wealthy merchant family, hoping for financial support. Afamia grew up in the merchant's household and married his son, Muhammad. However, happiness did not last long; the merchant and his son Muhammad died young from illness, leaving Afamia and the merchant's widow to rely on each other.\n\nIn the town was a rogue named Jabir, who coveted Afamia's beauty and attempted to force her to marry him, but Afamia firmly refused.\n\nNot long after, the merchant's widow fell seriously ill. Jabir seized the opportunity to poison her food, causing her death. Jabir colluded with the local Qadi, had Afamia arrested, declared her guilty without a trial, and sentenced her to death. On the way to the execution ground, filled with grievance, Afamia swore to God: 'I, Afamia, am innocent; my purity is known only to Allah. If I am truly wronged, may my blood not touch the earth, and may Allah perform a miracle to clear my name.'\n\nEveryone at the execution site described the same outcome—when the executioner raised his blade, Afamia's blood miraculously did not fall to the ground but splattered entirely onto a white veil. At that moment, the sky suddenly darkened with clouds, a storm arose, and snowflakes fell, covering the entire town even in the hot summer. Witnessing this miracle, all present cried out, 'Afamia is innocent!'\n\nThis news quickly reached [Root.Monarch.GetName].

On a bright morning, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s servants brought the prisoner to the city's central square. There, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally supervised the execution of the rebel by dismemberment with carts. By then, the Emir had been tortured beyond human semblance; his limbs were tied to four horses, a dagger still embedded in his belly, his body drenched in blood.
