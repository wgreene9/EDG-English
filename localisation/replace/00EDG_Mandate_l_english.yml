EDG_china_empire_reform_1_decision_desc:0 "By the mid-Ming period, due to land annexation, concealment, population flight, and the resulting chaos and inaccuracy in household and land registries, 'the wealthy possessed land without grain-tax obligations, while the poor bore the burdens of unjust apportionment.' The acreage and population under imperial control steadily diminished, and fiscal resources dried up. It was said that 'private households grew richer daily, the public treasury grew poorer daily; state impoverishment and popular destitution—the root of the ailment truly lies here.' Although some inflated figures arose from officials using smaller measurement bows to increase land area, a significant portion of land hidden by powerful landlords was indeed uncovered. The land survey brought 'real benefits to the common people but considerable inconvenience to influential official families,' thus facing opposition. However, it helped rectify the uneven distribution of taxes and labor duties, making 'the grain tax not increase yet its allocation appropriately balanced. Future state levies will be easier to collect, and the common people will feel as if granted a new life.'"
EDG_china_empire_reform_2_decision_desc:0 "We originally classified households into three categories: civilian, military, and artisan. All craftsmen were registered under the artisan status, subordinate to the government, with their status inherited across generations. They performed rotational or resident service for the state. This artisan registry system restricted craftsmen's freedom to operate independently. But now, we have amended the law: rotational artisans shall pay in silver, and the government will hire labor with silver. Thus, the rotational artisan system effectively exists in name only; those registered as artisans may freely engage in industry and commerce, with personal constraints greatly weakened. The deepening reform of artisan service undoubtedly promotes the development of private handicraft production."
EDG_china_empire_reform_3_decision_desc:0 "The Ming dynasty continued using the Two-Tax System, originally administered by the Ministry of Revenue. However, Ming emperors established a separate taxation system overseen by eunuchs personally appointed by the emperor, known as 'Supervising Eunuchs for Certain Taxes in Certain Areas.' By the Wanli era of Emperor Shenzong, prolonged border conflicts and nearly two centuries of Great Wall construction severely depleted state finances. During Wanli's reign, administration grew lax, officials corrupt, and tax supervisors imposed excessive levies. Yet this situation will no longer persist, for we shall abolish the mine supervisor system."
EDG_china_empire_reform_4_decision_desc:0 "When baochao (precious notes) were first issued, a policy of 'only outflow, no inflow' was implemented—meaning notes were put into circulation but not withdrawn, or were issued much more than recalled. The government issued paper notes to pay salaries and military stipends while collecting goods, gold, silver, and valuables from the populace. Yet when collecting taxes, it accepted only small amounts of new notes or none at all. These characteristics fully exposed the exploitative nature of the Great Ming's note system. To promote baochao, the Ming implemented the 'Household Salt-for-Notes Method,' where each adult household received one jin of salt in exchange for one guan of notes. The 'Shop Stall Levy' required merchants to pay shop stall taxes with notes. Though merchants and commoners were compelled to use notes, results were limited. From now on, however, we shall adopt a more scientific paper currency system."
EDG_china_empire_reform_5_decision_desc:0 "Since its inception, the Hanlin Academy has been intricately linked with the imperial examination system. Originating in the Sui and Tang dynasties, the imperial examination system was a product combining educational and selection mechanisms. Its core lay in selecting officials through examinations, institutionally guaranteeing and promoting the standardized vertical mobility of society's members. Despite its various flaws and shortcomings, under the social conditions of its time, it remained a relatively fair system for talent selection. It largely broke through the limitations of bloodline and regional ties in personnel appointment, establishing a culture-based standard that paralleled the deeply entrenched official-rank and gold standards in society. The imperial examination system offered hope for advancement to countless common scholars from the lower social strata, providing them with a reliable ladder for upward mobility. Many impoverished scholars studied diligently day and night, hoping to achieve fame on the golden list. After our reform of the Hanlin Academy, it will become our instrument for disseminating new ideas."
EDG_china_empire_reform_6_decision_desc:0 "Zhang Juzheng believed that 'the foremost task in achieving governance lies in securing the people's livelihood; the key to securing the people's livelihood lies solely in scrutinizing official administration.' He clearly regarded 'scrutinizing official administration' as the prerequisite for 'securing the people' and 'achieving governance.' From the outset, he embarked on sweeping rectifications centered on 'revering sovereign authority, evaluating official performance, enforcing rewards and punishments, and unifying decrees,' aiming to revitalize and uplift the decadent atmosphere where 'discipline was lax, laws unenforced, superiors and subordinates sought only appeasement, all matters were handled with compromise, where equivocation was called mediation, and accommodation was deemed skillful handling.' Only by strengthening centralization, reinforcing imperial edicts, and restoring discipline could 'laws and regulations be upheld to discipline all officials, and authority be consolidated to rectify all standards,' ensuring unimpeded implementation of reformed decrees."
EDG_china_empire_reform_7_decision_desc:0 "The Pacification Commission was a Ming dynasty supervisory institution with a military focus, situated between the provincial and prefectural levels, generally responsible for both civilian and military affairs within its jurisdiction—a local administrative body. The head of a Pacification Commission was titled 'Pacification Commissioner,' serving as the highest military and administrative authority of a local district with a connecting role. This institution first appeared during the Jin dynasty and was widely established nationwide under the Yuan. By the Ming and Qing periods, it was set up only in ethnic minority areas, with fewer Pacification Commissions than in previous dynasties, falling under the sequence of Tusi (native chieftain) administrations."
EDG_china_empire_reform_8_decision_desc:0 "The Six Ministries and the Censorate recorded the tasks to be completed by their respective officials within set deadlines in three separate ledgers: one retained by the Six Ministries and the Censorate as a base copy, another submitted to the Six Offices of Scrutiny, and the last presented to the Grand Secretariat. The Six Ministries and the Censorate checked progress monthly against these ledgers, registering each completed item; conversely, any failures had to be truthfully reported, or penalties would be imposed. The Six Offices of Scrutiny could also require the Six Ministries to report their implementation status every six months, with violations addressed according to established cases. Finally, the Grand Secretariat could verify the auditing work of the Six Offices of Scrutiny. This formed a comprehensive system where the Grand Secretariat directed supervisory bodies, which in turn oversaw the central Six Ministries, while the Six Ministries commanded civil and military officials and local administrators—establishing a thorough official evaluation mechanism."
EDG_china_empire_reform_9_decision_desc:0 "By the late Ming dynasty, the appointment of officials to regional military commands even bypassed the step of reporting to the Five Chief Military Commissions entirely, stripping these commissions of their authority to select and appoint military officers. Matters concerning troop training and military intelligence were also beyond the purview of the late Ming Five Chief Military Commissions. Training and military affairs were handled by regional governors, commanding generals, and their subordinate officers, who had no hierarchical relationship with the Five Chief Military Commissions and reported directly to their superiors—either governors-general or the imperial court—instead."
EDG_china_empire_reform_10_decision_desc:0 "The Ming dynasty followed the system of previous dynasties, with Maritime Trade Offices managing tributary relations and trade affairs with overseas nations. Each office had one Superintendent (rank 5b), two Vice Superintendents (rank 6b), and one subordinate Clerk (rank 9b). The Superintendent was either specially appointed or concurrently held by the Provincial Surveillance Commissioner or the Superintendent of the Salt Distribution Circuit. The Maritime Trade Offices were subordinate to the Provincial Administration Commission, thus keeping full taxation authority in the hands of its senior officials. It was not until the late Ming, when a fixed-quota tax-farming system was adopted, that responsibility for tax collection shifted to the Superintendents."
EDG_china_empire_reform_11_decision_desc:0 "The Council of Military Affairs oversaw all military and administrative powers, becoming the highest state organ of governance. It was placed entirely under the emperor's direct control, functioning as his personal secretariat. While in terms of authority it was the supreme governing body, in form it always remained a provisional institution."
EDG_china_empire_reform_12_decision_desc:0 "Since I, the ruler of the Chinese people, witnessed the Mandate of the Song end, and the True Man received Heaven's Decree from the desert, entering the Central Realm to become the sovereign of All Under Heaven—his reign, his sons, and his grandsons lasted over a hundred years. Now that Mandate too has ended, its lands and people are divided and contended by the brave and ambitious. Yet I, receiving from the Emperor above the gift of wise and worthy men to assist as ministers, have pacified arms and settled the people in their fields and villages, now holding territory spanning over twenty thousand li. All my ministers say: 'The people have no sovereign; we must honor you with the imperial title.' I dare not decline. Thus, this year, on the southern slopes of Zhong Mountain, I have prepared an altar and ceremonies to solemnly announce to the Supreme Deity and the Imperial Earth!"
