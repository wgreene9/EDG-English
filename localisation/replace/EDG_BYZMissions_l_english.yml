With their 'unmatched' size, galleasses could carry several times more guns and armed personnel than traditional galleys, with firepower and manpower being their greatest advantages. Guns were usually concentrated in the bow turret and stern castles. Early galleasses carried just over 20 guns (mainly conventional cannons capable of breaching enemy hulls, not counting smaller pieces like swivel guns or breech-loaders), a number increased to 30-40 by the 17th century to meet the demands of naval warfare for greater firepower. Galleass tactics were simple yet effective: before engaging in traditional boarding actions, they would first use their powerful firepower to damage and weaken enemy vessels (a decisive blow), and could even employ their massive metal rams to strike enemy hulls. If neither method succeeded, they could deploy their large complement of armed troops to board the enemy ship and deliver the final blow with swords and crossbows."

However, the deaths of Albert of Habsburg and Władysław III of Jagiellon taught us that surrendering one's church yields no benefit.

Although the Western imperial title was nominally returned to the East, and the Goths and Vandals remained subjects of the Empire, Europe's Dark Ages began with Emperor Zeno's compromises. Finally, about a century later, Emperor Justinian launched his campaign to reclaim the lost territories—yet true imperial revival never arrived. Due to the Great Plague, climate change, and a new wave of barbarian invasions, the Empire soon declined, a decline culminating in the Phocas revolt of 602.\n\nHeraclius rose from Carthage, ended Phocas's tyranny, and turned the tide, wresting Asian territories back from the Persians. Yet this victory quickly turned to ashes as Saracens surged from the desert and rapidly devoured half the world. From then on, Rome faced protracted multi-front threats. Though successive emperors resisted desperately, their efforts often proved futile as foreign peoples gnawed away at the Empire's borders from all sides; the Patriarch of Rome, obsessed with power and treason, conspired with barbarians to establish the false Western Church; Franks and Saxons successively usurped the imperial title; even Bulgarians besieged Constantinople, forcing the Emperor to recognize their self-proclaimed Tsar.\n\nYet Rome was not without revival. The Macedonian dynasty, especially under Basil II, restored the Empire to a zenith not seen since Heraclius. Romans regained dominance in Italy, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and Syria. But then, with the extinction of the Macedonian line, catastrophic turmoil and simultaneous invasions by Normans, Pechenegs, and Turks nearly destroyed Rome—the Komnenian dynasty's timely emergence granted the Empire another two centuries of life, only for shameless Latins to exploit internal strife and shatter the Empire.\n\nBut so what? Even in the most perilous, most helpless times, even when surrounded by infidels, even when reduced to a single city, the Roman people never yielded. God has finally favored Rome once more. The Dark Ages, where the false Western Church and barbarians obliterated knowledge and wisdom, have ended. The Dark Ages, where Eastern infidels and nomads plundered and slaughtered at will, have ended. Romans shall once again illuminate this millennium-long night with the light of wisdom and reason. The walls of New Rome shall not fall again; Roman civilization shall be restored across Europe and Asia; then, aboard ships, cross the oceans to the New World of the Americas; even beyond, propelled by steam—recorded by Greeks on papyrus—and paddle wheels—drawn by Romans on parchment—to illuminate distant India and China. The epic of the Roman Empire's restoration shall be sung for generations.\n\nThe world's long night is over. All Europe celebrates this monumental moment. In Rome and Constantinople, men and women weep tears of joy. Maintaining an empire of this scale will be a challenge, but for all humanity, you must succeed, lest the world plunge into another dark age of ignorance and brutality, bereft of Rome's guiding light."

From Byzantium to New Rome, even the Queen of Cities, yet the most fitting remains [the City of the World's Desire]. When the envoys of Kievan Rus first came to Constantinople, to the Hagia Sophia, and brought the miracles they witnessed back to their pagan Grand Prince, from their uncultured language, the ministers at a loss for words could only find one phrase to describe it all—'We knew not whether we were on earth or in heaven.'"

EDG_BYZ_mission_3_25_title:0 "The Land of Prosperity"
EDG_BYZ_mission_3_25_desc:0 "The first to found a city here was a Greek. In 657 BCE, a prince of Megara, guided by an oracle, established a city at the easternmost tip of this peninsula, naming it Byzantium after himself. Its fate, like that of the entire Greek world, flourished with the rise of the Greeks and declined with their fall. From a fishing village, it grew into a prosperous port controlling the trade route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Yet, like all Greek cities, as Roman legions defeated Greek phalanxes at Pydna, Thermopylae, and Asia Minor, Byzantium transformed from an independent city-state into a city of the Roman Republic, then the Roman Empire. Yet, whether by fortune or fate, Byzantium truly underwent its metamorphosis in Roman hands.\n\nIn 324 AD, the Roman Empire, long plagued by civil war, finally saw peace again. Constantine the Great, holding aloft a banner painted with the cross, reunified the entire Empire under his throne. However, just as the Eternal City on the Italian peninsula anticipated the Emperor bringing glory back to its birthplace, Constantine turned his gaze eastward—Rome had long since become outdated due to overpopulation, entrenched aristocracy, and old religions. Constantine desired a brand-new capital, and the location he chose was Byzantium, where he had once defeated his last rival for the throne. Now, he wished to transform it into the most beautiful jewel upon his crown."

EDG_BYZ_mission_3_26_title:0 "The City of the World's Desire"
EDG_BYZ_mission_3_26_desc:0 "Just six years later, on the site of old Byzantium, a vast new city arose. From the moment of its birth, it was destined to become the center of the world. Like Rome, it was built upon seven hills; even its official name was still Rome, albeit 'New Rome' (Nova Roma). Yet this city, fated to be known as the 'City of Constantine' and become the world's capital, served as the Roman Empire's capital for far longer than the Eternal City that gave the nation its name.\n\nOver the next three centuries, magnificent and grand edifices gradually spread across the city. Each great emperor—Constantine in the 4th century, Theodosius in the 5th, Justinian in the 6th—left monuments in the capital bearing witness to imperial glory.\n\nIn the Forum that once lay at the city's heart, Constantine summoned the finest artisans from every corner of the Empire. Statues of Alexander, Romulus, Caesar, Augustus, and down to Constantine himself lined the square. The glory of Greece and the greatness of Rome were fused together on this Greek colony by a Roman emperor. Two centuries later, when Justinian defeated the Persian Empire, securing 'Eternal Peace' for the embattled eastern frontier, a new bronze statue joined the heroes and emperors. Clad in Persian robes, astride a handsome steed, arm raised pointing eastward—this was Justinian himself, erecting a monument to his achievements like every great ruler before him.\n\nPerhaps Constantine built the city, but Justinian made it the most resplendent paradise on earth. Its soul may belong to the Hagia Sophia, its heart to the Hippodrome and the Great Palace. Yet its body, unquestionably, belongs to the walls encircling the peninsula, stretching twenty-two kilometers. Built by Theodosius, walls that made Attila the Hun pause, walls that endured a millennium of warfare and fell only at the dawn of the gunpowder age, guarded Constantine's Forum and Hippodrome, Justinian's churches and palaces. When the medieval darkness enveloped the world and illiterate barbarians roamed the lands, only the ramparts of the Theodosian Walls protected the last glimmer of civilization on the continent.\n\nOnly behind these walls could culture, art, education, and philosophy survive, free from barbarian ravages, preserving the reason, science, and history born from the pens of Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Strabo, Livy, Ptolemy, and Saint Augustine. Even as the Empire tottered, isolated, and the City of the World itself lay in ruins, within the protection of the Theodosian Walls, the exquisite mosaics in the Chora Church could still kindle a spark of hope for the dying empire.\n\nBut lo, Rome has awakened! Just as a small city once conquered the entire Mediterranean, the emperors beginning with Andronikos V recreated the miracle once achieved by the Republic. Roman lands were restored one by one, Roman legions proved invincible. Barbarians from all directions bowed once more, converting to God's Gospel and obeying imperial law. New Rome's markets again teemed with goods and merchants from across the globe; New Rome's squares displayed rare treasures and wonders anew; New Rome's harbors once more docked invincible fleets and sailors; New Rome's walls stood stronger and taller than ever; New Rome's universities housed more scholars and books than before; New Rome's embrace grew broader and grander, stretching across the strait to Chalcedon. The light of New Rome shall never be extinguished again. Esto perpetua!"

In 1426, he held a prominent position under Manuel II.\n\nIn 1438, when the Council of Florence convened to seek reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, Gemistos was among the representatives of the Greek Church. Initially, he opposed union due to disagreements with the Catholic Church over the nature of the Holy Spirit. Though his views on this matter did not change, he later actively promoted union. However, the goal of union was not achieved.\n\nIn Gemistos's time, Aristotelian philosophy was prevalent but growing stale. Displeased with Aristotelian scholasticism, Gemistos specialized in Platonic philosophy and dedicated himself to its propagation. Cardinal Bessarion was his student. In Florence, he was introduced to Cosimo de' Medici, persuading him of the superiority of Platonic philosophy over Aristotelianism. Thus, Gemistos became a leading figure in the new intellectual currents of Western philosophy, and Platonism became fashionable in Florence, beginning to overshadow Aristotle throughout Italy. Consequently, some accused Gemistos and his followers of intending to replace Christianity with Platonism. Until the end of the 15th century, Plato remained an idol in Italian philosophical circles. Both in Byzantium and the West, he engaged in numerous debates with Aristotelian schools.\n\nIn 1441, the elderly Gemistos returned to the Peloponnese as an imperial official. In 1452 (or perhaps 1454), Gemistos Plethon died in Mistra."

The Sassanids were even stronger than the Parthians, frequently engaging Rome and even capturing Emperor Valerian at Edessa in 260 under Shapur I.
