EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.1.d:0 "By the 15th century, Italian universities had fully demonstrated their vitality. Increased wealth made the systematic development of education possible. Initially, schools typically offered only three subjects—Civil Law, Canon Law, and Medicine; later, Rhetoric, Philosophy, and Astronomy were gradually introduced. At the time, Astronomy was generally synonymous with Astrology, though there were exceptions. Sometimes, teachers were paid substantial salaries. As culture advanced, competition in education intensified. Prestigious universities engaged in fierce battles to recruit renowned scholars. Some teachers, however, taught voluntarily without receiving salaries.\n\nIn the developed regions of Italy, even small towns had Latin schools, established not merely in preparation for higher education. This was because, in the contemporary view, beyond basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, Latin was considered essential, followed by Logic. These schools were not dependent on the Church but were operated by municipal authorities; however, there were also private schools. Under the management of a few distinguished humanists, this school system not only achieved near-perfect organization but also became a means of implementing higher education in the modern sense, sparking a wave of educational fervor across the Italian region."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.2.d:0 "Manetti displayed early talent, completing his commercial apprenticeship while still a child and working as a bookkeeper in a bank. But soon this life seemed empty and unsustainable to him, so he began to yearn for scholarship, believing that through learning one could achieve immortality. Thereafter, he immersed himself in books with diligent study, an endeavor rarely undertaken by laymen before him. As mentioned, he became one of the most erudite scholars of his era. After being appointed by the government as deputy magistrate and tax collector in Pescia and Pistoia, he fulfilled his duties guided by the noble ideals inspired by both religious sentiment and humanist studies. He successfully carried out the most unpopular tax levies imposed by Florence and declined payment for his work. As a magistrate, he refused all gifts, detested bribery, suppressed gambling, ensured ample grain supplies for the state, tirelessly mediated lawsuits amicably, and miraculously appeased anger with kindness. The people of Pistoia could never discern his bias toward either political faction. As if to symbolize shared rights and interests, he spent his leisure time writing a history of the city. The completed book, bound in purple covers, was preserved as a sacred relic in the town hall. Upon his departure, the city presented him with a brocade banner embroidered with the city's emblem and an exquisite silver helmet. In $YEAR$, Manetti passed away due to illness in a small village within [Root.GetAdjective] territory, but the impact of his illustrious life did not fade away with the wind."

This era also gave rise to numerous individuals of exceptional talent and learning, whose remarkable abilities and wisdom became legendary. Giannozzo Manetti gained fame both domestically and abroad, becoming a highly respected figure. His contributions were widely praised by the people, and he was regarded as one of the most outstanding scholars of the Renaissance. Not long ago, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] received a guest who introduced himself as a disciple of Giannozzo Manetti, detailing his talents and field of study. He expressed his determination to serve the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and presented some of his own ideas and innovations.

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.5.d:0 "With the advancement of the Italian Education Movement, competition in education has intensified. The battle among universities to recruit renowned scholars is raging fiercely. Under such circumstances, it is said that Bologna sometimes allocated up to half of its fiscal revenue to fund its university. Teaching appointments were generally short-term, sometimes lasting only six months, causing scholars to live itinerant lives akin to actors. However, lifelong tenure for professors did exist during this period. Some institutions even required teachers to pledge not to teach elsewhere the knowledge they had already delivered in one location. Meanwhile, other educators taught voluntarily without receiving salaries. As the Italian Education Movement surged forward, even small towns established Latin schools. Many believe that constructing more primary schools will infuse [Root.GetName] with greater vitality."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.6.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] citizens and secular intellectuals expressed their cultural propositions through the revival of ancient Greek and Roman cultures. Thus, the Renaissance emphasized the aspect of the new culture learning from classical models, rather than being a mere classical revival; it was, in essence, a new bourgeois cultural movement against feudalism. Its influence manifested in art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other facets of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed humanist methods in their research and sought realism and human emotion in art. As an ideological liberation movement promoting emerging bourgeois culture, the Renaissance laid a solid foundation for the early development of capitalist sprouts during its dissemination, while simultaneously accumulating primitive wealth for the nascent bourgeoisie. The Renaissance gradually liberated people from the constraints of traditional feudal theology, prompting exploration of human value beneath religious veneers—ushering in an era where individuals were recognized as concrete beings, rather than mere appendages of feudal or religious lords. The movement fully affirmed human value and emphasized humanity, becoming a powerful call to break through the layers of medieval obscurity. It profoundly impacted contemporary politics, science, economics, philosophy, and theological worldviews, representing a revolutionary storm in the ideological realm of the rising bourgeoisie, often hailed as the 'Age of Giants'."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.7.d:0 "A worthy son of Florence has published a work titled 'The Prince'. This volume contains numerous philosophies of governance, addressing not only hereditary monarchs but also the potential emergence of new princes. It elaborates on how to maintain power and successfully rule conquered territories, asserting that the ends justify the means.\n\nIn his work 'The Prince', our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is mentioned multiple times. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ability to rule the state is praised, while other nations are cautioned against relying on mercenary forces.\n\n'Although recently a glimmer of light shone upon one individual, leading some to believe he might be sent by God to redeem Italy, he was ultimately abandoned by Fortune at the peak of his endeavors. Thus Italy remains lifeless, awaiting anyone who can heal her wounds, halt the plundering of Lombardy, and end the extortions in the Kingdom of Naples and Tuscany...'\n\nThrough these words, Machiavelli bestows exceptionally high praise upon [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n'If anyone believes that to secure his new principality against enemies, it is necessary to gain friends for himself, to achieve victory through force or fraud, to make the people both love and fear him, to ensure soldiers obey and revere him, to eliminate those who could or might harm him, to reform old institutions in new ways, to be both severe and kind, magnanimous and liberal, to disband disloyal troops and raise new armies, to maintain friendships with kings and princes so they must gladly assist you or hesitate to injure you—if anyone believes all this necessary, he can find no brighter example than the actions of this [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].'"

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.8.t:0 "The Prince"
EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.8.d:0 "Fourteen years of political work, particularly in diplomatic practice, provided Machiavelli with abundant historical examples for his political theories and his work 'The Prince'. Beyond his routine duties of handling numerous foreign affairs documents, Machiavelli's first responsibility was serving as a temporary special envoy for the Florentine Republic, visiting foreign nations and various Italian city-states while regularly reporting to the 'Council of Ten'. During wartime, he was tasked with military organization and related duties, becoming a trusted assistant and strategic advisor to the head of government, Soderini.\n\nFrom the age of thirty, he embarked on nearly thirty diplomatic missions, traveling to France, Switzerland, various German states, and Italian city-states. His preserved documents—including 'Report on France', 'Report on Germany', accounts of Duke Cesare Borgia of Romagna, and other communications—demonstrate Machiavelli's acute insight into the socio-political realities of European nations and Italian city-states. These works reflect his deep understanding and meticulous analysis of rulers' true nature, forming the foundation of his elaborated political thought and military theory. These diplomatic experiences profoundly taught him that a weak nation holds no leverage in foreign affairs.\n\nMachiavelli's experiences endowed him with boundless wisdom, which he distilled into 'The Prince'. The book represents a theoretical synthesis of centuries of 'political experimentation and intense transformation' in Florence and across Italy, combined with Machiavelli's own years of governmental experience. It comprehensively elaborates his theories on princely absolutism and statecraft, analyzing causes behind Italy's prolonged wartime fragmentation while proposing a solution for unification: establishing a strong centralized state. Attempting to realize Dante's vision of unity and sovereign authority, Machiavelli delves deeply into statecraft, directly presenting rulers with practical methods for implementation, alongside his aspirations for ending Italy's chaotic condition."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.9.d:0 "During the Italian Wars, improved firearms such as muskets and bronze cannons with wheeled carriages saw widespread use for the first time. Artillery was first deployed in field battles and in the offense and defense of fortresses and fortified towns. The tactic of besieging without direct assault was frequently employed against strongholds. Field armies were used to relieve besieged positions. When attacking fortresses, besieging lines would first be constructed outside the range of the defensive fortifications' artillery, followed by containment lines composed of earthworks. Only after these preparations would the assault gradually commence. These new military tactics and equipment brought about profoundly far-reaching changes."

With the advent of gunpowder and tactical changes driven by other infantry weapons, there is a great demand for troops proficient in using these new arms. As professional armies cannot fully meet this demand, it is addressed by recruiting mercenaries from regions such as Italy, Switzerland, or Germany. A growing number of professional mercenary officers provide substantial personnel support to nations undergoing military transformation. Moreover, to sustain prolonged foreign wars, countries must develop their national economies. Warring governments place particular emphasis on cannon founding, shipbuilding, and printing. Metal production is stimulated, and mining industries flourish. To transport ores and various raw materials, governments dig and deepen canals, build roads and bridges, secure trade routes, restrict local tolls, and promote the standardization of weights and measures, thereby improving the conditions for capitalist development."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_education.19.d:0 "Raffaello Sanzio, commonly known as Raphael, was a renowned Italian painter and the youngest of the 'High Renaissance Trinity'. He represented the pinnacle achievable by Renaissance artists pursuing ideal beauty. With his peaceful and refined temperament, he created numerous Madonnas, with his works fully embodying tranquility, harmony, symmetry, and perfect, serene order.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning on Good Friday in 1483, Raphael was born in Urbino, Italy. His father, Giovanni Santi, was a little-known painter who, after the birth of his only son, named him Raphael and insisted the child be raised personally by his mother. Thus, during his childhood, Raphael was nurtured by his parents' family environment, developing good manners without exposure to the vulgar and rough ways of poorer households. As Raphael grew older, Giovanni noticed his particular love for painting and notable talent in it, and began teaching him to paint. Within a few years, the still young Raphael became a capable assistant to Giovanni in his numerous works in Urbino.\n\nThe majority of Raphael's paintings depict the Madonna, so people habitually associate Raphael with images of tender and gentle Madonnas. He enjoyed the great honor of being the foremost painter for the Papal court in the Vatican and, alongside Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, is celebrated as one of the three giants of the Italian Renaissance. For centuries, he has been praised as the greatest artistic genius. Outwardly, Raphael appeared as a serene, untroubled poet and painter, possessing remarkably swift and superb talent. He seemed to effortlessly give form to the artistic ideals of Renaissance Neoplatonism.\n\nRaphael's immense contribution to Italian Renaissance art in art history is an undeniable fact. Although, in terms of intellectual depth and innovation, he may not equal Leonardo; in grandeur and sculptural form, he may not match Michelangelo; and in color and sensuality, he may not surpass the Venetian School, he excelled at fully utilizing his synthesizing artistic genius. Thus, he was able to achieve the most glorious artistic accomplishments of the Renaissance era. Raphael absorbed the essence of preceding masters' styles and techniques early on, then unified these essences within his own practical creations. Focusing on the expression of ideal human beauty, he concretely embodied the spirit of artistic harmony characteristic of the Renaissance, making him a gentle and consummate master of humanist art. This harmonization of idealized beauty is the very spirit of Raphael's art."

This was an extremely complex task, taking over twenty years to complete. It is somewhat curious that, although trained under a sculptor, Uccello did not work as one, as far as we know. However, since many artists of the era were versatile and skilled in multiple disciplines, Uccello's shift in direction is not particularly surprising.

In 1401, a competition was held to create the bronze double doors for the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral, which Ghiberti won. His work was distinctive—graceful, vivid, and exquisitely crafted. In 1402, the judges decided to commission him to sculpt the doors, a decision that brought recognition and fame to the artist, then just over 20 years old. The work on the doors extended until 1424. The 1410s and 1420s were a period of flourishing creativity for him; by 1413, he had already cast many panels for the baptistery doors. Later, he explored new approaches to solve problems of pictorial space, making his figures more elegant and dynamic. In the late 1420s, he met the young humanist scholar Alberti. Both shared the belief that the beauty of ancient art lay in idealizing nature, capturing its essence—that is, expressing vitality through sculpture, with life being its most prominent visible quality. Ghiberti's interest in humanism is evident in his writings, the Commentarii, which consist of three parts: a history of ancient art, records of modern art, and theoretical commentary, including an autobiography of the author."

Of course, to have such "freedoms," there must also be freedom in the ownership of means of production, and the common prerequisite for all these freedoms is human freedom. At this time, Italy called for human freedom, and a stagnant Europe needed a new ideological movement advocating for human liberty.\n\nThe emergence of capitalist sprouts also made the rise of such an ideological movement possible. The prosperity of the urban economy made successful merchants, workshop owners, bankers, and others with immense wealth more confident in individual value and strength, filled with a spirit of innovation, enterprise, and risk-taking. Versatile, elegant, and erudite individuals were widely respected. This provided a solid material foundation, a suitable social environment, and a pool of talent for the Renaissance.

Architecture was also influenced by antiquity, as exemplified by Filippo Brunelleschi's dome for the Florence Cathedral. Built between 1420 and 1436, this largest dome in the world defines the city's distinctive skyline. The urban landscape reflected the application of humanist knowledge, the enhanced status of Florence as a pioneer of the new culture, the revival of the old city-republics, and notably, the emergence of Venice with a renewed image. Rulers, architects, and artists of the Renaissance were concerned with how to visually capture the entire city through imagery and how the city could and should be transformed through new construction projects.

He recommended that the government recruit peasants from the surrounding countryside for military service. Because of their endurance, coupled with good equipment and regular training, they could become invincible. Furthermore, Machiavelli participated in the practice of military service reform. During his long tenure as Secretary to the Florentine Republic's Council of Ten, he drafted detailed plans to replace mercenaries with a citizen militia.

This conclusion was drawn from his study of the rise and fall of ancient Rome. He argued that the main reason why figures like Sulla, Marius, and Caesar disrupted the balance of the Roman system, shook the republican polity, and led to the rise of tyrannical rule was that the Senate failed to firmly control the army. Therefore, it was essential to establish strict organizational systems and use legal means to ensure highly centralized and unified command over the military. In The Prince, he advised new monarchs: "Raise your own armies, and make yourself the sole commander of these forces." Simultaneously, he urged rulers to understand military affairs, familiarize themselves with matters related to the army, and "have a mind capable of adapting to the changes required by fortune and worldly affairs."

EDG_flavor_age_ITA_war.12.d:0 "In northern and central Italy, the commune—once an ordinary autonomous organization in political life that later grew in strength—perhaps became Italy's most disruptive force. The term 'commune' applied not only to the republican polity itself but also to cities that had lost their freedom under the control of emerging ruling classes. Smaller cities submitted to more powerful neighboring ones, but this did not create an ideal state of equal coexistence among cities under a centralized government. Instead, it led to a situation where dominant communes enslaved others and deprived them of a voice in governance. Just as the Republic of Pisa and the Republic of Pistoia were ruled by Florentines, the citizens of Pavia and Cremona were not direct subjects of the Visconti family but were governed by the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. The annexation of smaller cities continued into the 15th century, by which time Italy was effectively composed of five dominant polities: the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Florence, and the Papal States. The annexation of small cities by larger ones deprived a vast number of Italian citizens of political rights, breeding lasting and dangerous discontent. Many Italian writers agreed that these superficially submissive Italian citizens were the root of the nation's calamities. The armies of various states recruited these ostensibly compliant Italians as mercenaries. These citizens saw foreign invasions as an opportunity to escape domestic oppression, thus turning a blind eye to the invasions. Philippe de Commines observed that after Charles VIII, the Italians welcomed the French army's invasion of Naples 'like a saint.'

Thus, the Church has the authority to set various conditions, such as reciting short prayers, giving alms to the poor, or performing other good works, enabling the faithful to share in the treasures of this spiritual treasury, allowing the merits of Jesus and the saints to be applied to them. Therefore, any faithful who fulfills the conditions stipulated by the Church can obtain an indulgence.\n\nThe construction of St. Peter's Basilica began five years ago.

The Dominican friar Johann Tetzel, sent by the Holy See to the Holy Roman Empire to promote the plenary indulgence, even stated: 'As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs.' This distortion of its spiritual purpose for financial gain particularly angered the authorities in the Holy Roman Empire. Secular nobles watched as the money of the Empire's subjects continuously flowed to the Church.

This was the first regular tactical formation established in Western Europe based on theories of weapon usage since the phalanx formations of ancient Rome fell out of use. In terms of its actual combat role, this columna was equivalent to a modern battalion or regiment, commanded by a Maestre de Campo or Colonel.\n\nOver the next 20 years, the Spanish gradually adopted a formation system called the 'tercio' to replace the old medieval 'batallones'. Initially, each tercio consisted of a varying number of columnas, eventually standardized to three. This gave each tercio a total strength of over 3,000 men. As the tercio became the standard formation of the Spanish army, sword-and-buckler men and halberdiers disappeared, replaced by tercios composed of pikemen and arquebusiers, known as the 'Spanish Square' or 'Tercio'.\n\nFollowing the conquest of Iberia by [Root.GetAdjective], we incorporated numerous Tercio regiments.

EDG_flavorBOOK.1.t:0 "Frankfurt Book Fair"
EDG_flavorBOOK.1.d:0 "The Frankfurt Book Fair can trace its origins back to the Frankfurt Trade Fair in the 11th century. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II granted privileges to the Frankfurt Trade Fair to provide necessary security for merchants. Subsequent rulers continued to bestow these privileges. By the end of the Middle Ages, Frankfurt had developed into 'one of Europe's most important international markets,' and the trade of manuscripts at the medieval fair became the origin of the future Frankfurt Book Fair. Due to Frankfurt's proximity to Mainz, the birthplace of movable type printing, its superior geographical location at the crossroads of east-west and north-south trade routes, its convenient water transport via the Rhine and Main rivers, and the existence of the major fair, it was well-positioned to become a center for the dissemination of the new printing technology and a European book market. The Frankfurt Trade Fair increasingly became a frequent destination for booksellers and printers from various countries. In 1485, the Frankfurt Book Fair officially emerged.\n\nThe arrival of numerous book printers and traders brought substantial revenue to the Frankfurt Trade Fair and further stimulated the development of the book trade. According to the Frankfurt city ledger of 1488, the stalls and market fees related to printers and booksellers during that year's Easter Fair totaled 267 Heller and 4 Shillings, accounting for nearly eight percent of the fair's total revenue. By the mid-16th century, Frankfurt had become the center of the European printing and publishing industry and international book trade. Booksellers, scholars, government officials, and book collectors from across Europe gathered here annually to conduct book trades and academic exchanges. Various books and the latest information converged at the book fair and then spread throughout Europe via the movement of people and books. A scholar thus remarked: 'Frankfurt's location and its world-famous fair allowed it, during the era of Latin literature, to effortlessly cross language boundaries and rapidly become the world market for literature.'"

EDG_flavorBOOK.3.d:0 "While the Germans utilized the paper revolution to introduce movable type, the Italians caught up and regained dominance using their artistic talent and skill in creating luxury goods. Dürer learned his initial craft from his father as a youth, showing exceptional aptitude for drawing; by age 13, he could draw his own portrait with striking realism, and a portrait of his father at 19 fully demonstrated his mature draftsmanship, rivaling even da Vinci. He later worked for three years in the workshop of the painter Michael Wolgemut. Wolgemut's large workshop also produced woodcut illustrations for Dürer's godfather, the printer and publisher Anton Koberger. This exposure to the largest printing house of the time greatly influenced Dürer. His first encounter with copper engraving techniques in childhood left an indelible impression, which decisively shaped his later creative contributions to printmaking.\n\nDürer was fortunate to live in such a vibrant era, allowing his talents to flourish. His works include woodcuts and other prints, oil paintings, sketch drawings, and detailed studies. Among his oeuvre, his prints are the most influential. He is considered one of the finest masters of woodcut and copper engraving. His watercolor landscapes rank among his greatest achievements, capturing atmosphere and emotion with remarkable vividness. As Germany's greatest painter, Dürer's artistic explorations profoundly impacted German art. As one critic noted, 'Dürer is the representative national painter of Germany. He was also the artistic founder who brought Italian Renaissance ideas into Germany and initiated a new epoch for German national art.' Friedrich Engels also highly praised him, regarding Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci as giants produced by an era that needed giants.\n\nMerchants from Frankfurt have also shown great interest in Dürer, publishing his works extensively and attempting to sell them to us."

At 13, Dürer drew a self-portrait with a silverpoint pen; its elegant and delicate strokes already revealed his extraordinary artistic talent. Although Dürer held deep respect for the masterful craftsmanship of artisans, driven by a strong thirst for knowledge and a desire to broaden his artistic horizons, he became an apprentice at 15 to Michael Wolgemut, the finest local painter. During his three-year apprenticeship, Dürer copied many works, gradually mastering various painting techniques, and began creating his own works using nature, the human body, and plants as subjects.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship, Dürer traveled across Europe, reaching Italy in 1494. The frescoes by Giotto in Padua left a deep impression on him. He greatly admired the artistic values and achievements in plastic arts of the Italian Renaissance and began consciously absorbing certain Italian elements, focusing his artistic exploration on the laws of form. The color and depiction of nature by the Venetians also greatly inspired him.\n\nA contemporary recalling Dürer's appearance wrote: 'He had an expressive face, bright eyes, a nose the Greeks would call quadrangular, a long neck, a broad chest, a tightly girded abdomen, strongly developed thigh muscles, well-proportioned and sturdy calves, and a refined appearance. Those who saw his fingers noted their slender, ivory-like beauty. His witty conversation and demeanor were utterly captivating, so much so that listeners felt nothing was more regrettable than when his speech ended. He was knowledgeable in astronomy, geography, philosophy, and aesthetics—not only understanding them but able to articulate them eloquently.' Friedrich Engels, in his famous assessment of the European Renaissance era, regarded Dürer as one of the outstanding figures alongside Leonardo da Vinci.

Albrecht was a devout and active church reformer, a capable ruler and brave warrior, widely regarded as a good mentor and friend. Yet beneath his amiable exterior lurked a cruel, illiterate, despotic tyrant. In 1420, he brazenly abolished the Habsburg tradition of protecting the Jews in Austria, subjecting them to brutal persecution so severe it even drew disapproval from the new Pope. Albrecht was solely intent on plundering the Jews' savings to fund King Sigismund's campaign against the Hussite heresy in Bohemia. After gaining control of Moravia, Albrecht's persecution of the Jews intensified. In 1433, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor, and the loyal Albrecht was granted permission to marry the Emperor's daughter, Princess Elizabeth. The childless Sigismund later designated Albrecht as the heir to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary, finally giving Albrecht a return on his investment.

Its initial establishment followed the model of the University of Paris. On June 18, 1365, Pope Urban V confirmed the university's foundation but refused to approve a Faculty of Theology, denying the University of Vienna the status of a full university. One reason may have been the intervention of Emperor Charles IV, who had founded Prague University in 1348 and feared competition from Vienna. Duke Rudolf died on July 27, 1365, during a trip to Milan, at the age of 25.\n\nUntil the early 16th century, the University of Vienna remained one of the most popular universities north of the Alps. However, after the spread of the Lutheran Reformation around 1520, many students of the University of Vienna, seen as a 'papal institution,' withdrew and transferred to Protestant colleges. When the Turks besieged Vienna in 1529, the university was nearly wiped out, sometimes having no more than 30 students. Archduke Ferdinand I, who had ruled the Austrian hereditary lands since 1521, sought to strengthen and expand the local monarch's power over the estates. In this context, he—like the Protestant authorities—recognized the importance of schools and universities as training centers for future officials and loyal subjects. To achieve this goal, it was necessary, on one hand, to raise the educational standard again to compete with newly founded universities and, on the other hand, to prevent the spread of reformist ideas through education. The University of Vienna was already infiltrated by Protestants: although the Faculty of Theology de facto no longer existed due to dwindling membership, supporters of Luther held a majority in the three secular faculties. In 1524, they refused to write evaluations of Protestant texts. The jurists and physicians stated it was not part of their duties, while members of the Faculty of Arts argued they could not assess books they were not permitted to read—after all, Luther's works had been banned since 1520.\n\nNevertheless, the University of Vienna, as a center of arts and culture in Austria, played a significant role in the dissemination of advanced ideas within the region."

Starting from the late 15th century, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, facing imperial financial constraints, established this new armed force modeled after the Swiss mercenaries to achieve his political aims. For nearly half a century from the late 15th century to the 1530s, these soldiers learned and developed new infantry tactics while continuing the long-standing Germanic tradition of martial prowess. They once dominated Western European battlefields and became a force highly sought after by European monarchs in the first half of the 16th century. They also earned the reputation of being the most peculiarly dressed army in human history. When they marched through the Central European countryside in their bizarre, flamboyant slashed uniforms, shouldering pikes and zweihanders, it was a spectacular sight. Their rise, glory, and decline were driven by the objective laws of military development, yet they also contain many intriguing stories."

In 1748, she issued new army regulations, implementing military reforms. Previously, the army was supplied by large and small landowners, requiring negotiations for each recruitment, making the army unstable and preventing proper military training. After the reforms, the state allocated a 'military tax' to the landowners and centralized conscription. Officers became professional, requiring formal training and being appointed and promoted based on military achievements. The monarchy now possessed a standing army of 108,000 men, uniformly trained and centrally controlled. To cultivate military talent, the Theresa government established the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in 1752. Between 1757 and 1758, a General Staff was also established. This series of military reforms greatly enhanced the military capabilities of the Habsburg Monarchy.

In the 9th century, the Magyars arrived in Hungary. Starting from Hungary, they raided Europe, spreading terror comparable to that of Attila's Huns four centuries earlier. However, after their conversion to Christianity, the Magyars' Hungary quickly became the bulwark of Christendom in the East.

Previous Habsburg rulers, such as Albert III and Maximilian's father, Frederick III, also played significant roles in centralizing art treasures and book collections. During his time in the Low Countries, Maximilian became a bibliophile. As the husband of Mary of Burgundy, he came into possession of the vast Burgundian library, which, according to some sources, was brought back to Austria upon his return to his homeland. However, according to the official website of the Austrian National Library, the Habsburgs did not bring the collection to Vienna until 1581. Maximilian also inherited the Tyrolean library of his uncle Sigismund, who was also a great patron of culture. When he married Bianca Maria, Italian masterpieces were incorporated into the collection. The collection became more organized when Maximilian commissioned Ladislaus Sunthaym, Jakob Mennel, and Johannes Cuspinian to acquire and transcribe books. By the early 16th century, the library housed significant works of Bohemian, French, and Italian book art. In 1504, Conrad Celtis first mentioned the Imperial Library as an organized collection being expanded through purchases. Maximilian's collection was dispersed between Innsbruck, Vienna, and Wiener Neustadt. The Wiener Neustadt portion was managed by Conrad Celtis. The more valuable part was in Innsbruck. As early as Maximilian's time, the concept and function of the library had evolved, with scholars' access to books becoming very important. Under Maximilian, who had a casual attitude towards scholars, they had easy access to the Emperor, the court, and thus the library. However, although rulers like Maximilian II and Charles VI intended for the library to be accessible to the public, this process was not completed until 1860.

Its creators attempted to integrate figures from well-known ancient myths and legends—such as mermaids, Amazons, giants, and dragons—into the lineages of contemporary nobility and royalty. As a work that blends biblical stories, imperial history, Austrian history, and even fanciful heraldry and imaginative biographies, the Chronicle of the 95 Lords can be considered the pinnacle of this genre. The 50 manuscripts that have survived from the 15th century attest to the chronicle's enduring literary appeal, and its content was passed down through generations, often embellished by later authors. Some authors added the legend of Norix, son of Hercules, founding Austria, claimed that Caesar built the city of Vienna, and even included forged letters from Caesar and Nero.

Led by Albrecht Dürer and Albrecht Altdorfer, engravers created two large series of woodcuts for Maximilian, named 'The Triumphal Procession' and 'The Triumphal Arch', to extol his noble lineage and glorious deeds. These prints were reproduced on continuous rolls of wallpaper and sent to hundreds of territories and cities to decorate the palaces and council halls of feudal lords.\n\nMaximilian also maintained a host of court literati to compose poems and songs praising his virtues and accomplishments. He bestowed the poet's laurel upon the Renaissance scholar Conrad Celtis and appointed him head of the College of Poetry and Mathematics at the University of Vienna. Celtis, in return, praised Maximilian as a great hunter and warrior, comparing him to ancient heroes from German history.

However, he faced opposition not only from his brothers but also from the local nobility. Over the following century, as fragmentation worsened and the state weakened, successive Dukes of Kraków gradually lost their original suzerainty over the other duchies and ultimately abandoned efforts to reunite them. Meanwhile, the initial five duchies—Greater Poland, Masovia-Kuyavia, Lesser Poland, Sandomierz, and Silesia—also progressively disintegrated, breaking into smaller fiefdoms granted to the ever-increasing number of distant descendants of the Piast dynasty. Although the Kingdom of Poland failed to maintain stable unity for a long time thereafter, there is no doubt that Kraków remained the political, economic, religious, and cultural center of the Poles for the past three hundred years.

This concept encompassed all Polish lands, even those occupied by foreign rulers. In 1374, under pressure from the Polish nobility, King Louis signed the Privilege of Koszyce. This act emphasized the indivisible territorial integrity of the Polish state, passed down through generations, and stipulated that even the king had no right to cede any part of the land. This act clearly indicated that the Kingdom of Poland was not an ordinary feudal state; it had already developed the spirit of a nation-state.

On his journey, Bolesław hospitably received Adalbert. However, shortly after leaving Poland, Adalbert was killed by the Prussians. Upon hearing this news, Bolesław sent envoys to ransom his body from the Prussians. It is said Bolesław paid its weight in gold. He then interred the priest in the cathedral of Gniezno.\n\nLearning of these events, Pope Sylvester II canonized Adalbert in 999. A significant subsequent step was the elevation of Gniezno to an archbishopric and the establishment of new bishoprics in Wrocław, Kołobrzeg, and Kraków. This effectively created a Polish ecclesiastical province, freeing the Polish Church from the protection of the German Archbishopric of Magdeburg and initiating the history of an independent Polish Church.\n\nIndeed, throughout Poland's long history, since its independence, the Polish Church has been very tolerant regarding matters of faith. As early as the Middle Ages, Poland served as a refuge for heretics and Jews. Kraków, for instance, was a city like Babylon (Babel), where different languages could be heard on its streets, and Polish, Italian, and Latin were widely used in noble circles. Whenever European nations began expelling Jews, the Jewish population within Poland would swell.\n\nHowever, the Republic of Sandomierz was founded on religious principles.

EDG_flavorMRK.1.d:0 "In 1215, the rebellion launched by the Marinid dynasty of the Zenata tribe struck a heavy blow against the already declining empire. By 1248, this rebellion became the final straw that broke the Almohad Caliphate. Using a feigned surrender stratagem, the Marinids successfully assassinated the Almohad Caliph. The banner of the Zenata tribe was raised over Fez near the Rif Mountains, and even the inland Tafilalt was captured.\n\nTo the east lay the Zenata Marinid dynasty, to the west the Almohads, like the morning sun overshadowing the evening glow. The Marinids had long coveted the remaining Almohad lands but were restrained by the threat from the post-Fatimid dynasty to their east. In 1258, the Marinid Sultan launched a southern expedition directly targeting Marrakesh. The women of the Almohad court wept daily, praying for a true Mahdi to save them. Perhaps their prayers were answered, or perhaps by fate's coincidence, Sultan Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq passed away in his camp, called by God. Seeing the unusual commotion in the enemy camp outside the city, the Almohad forces sallied forth en masse and decisively defeated the Zenata coalition. The Saadi ruler of Tafilalt quickly switched allegiance back to the Almohad dynasty.\n\nThereafter, conflicts occasionally erupted between the Marinid dynasty and the revitalized Almohad Caliphate. However, with one side receiving support from the Iberian Peninsula and the other maintaining long-term friendly relations with the post-Fatimid dynasty, the Maghreb retained a delicate and fragile balance."

At that time, the Almohad Caliphate was deeply embroiled in the wars ignited by the Zenata tribe and the Marinid dynasty, its reach to the east overstretched. Towns in Kabylia and Tlemcen pledged allegiance to various masters, and the governance along the Barbary Coast was near collapse. Sulayman ibn Dawud of the Fatimid family raised his standard.

History knows him as 'Stephen of Cloyes.' He asserted he received a divine revelation where Jesus commanded him to raise a crusade, and the Knights Templar of the time became his supporters. In the spring of 1121, the crusaders crossed Switzerland southward, bypassing Cathar-held territories, and set sail from Genoa. Their target was not directly Egypt but Tunis, to seize a springboard for attacking Egypt. When lookouts in Tunis saw the endless sails approaching from the north, they never imagined they would be the Christians' landing target. After token resistance, the defenders were driven from the city, and the Governor of Tunis, Abu Zakariya Yahya, was captured. By the winter of 1121, Kairouan fell, its Great Mosque looted by the crusaders, and a new Crusader Kingdom was established in Tunisia.\n\nThereafter, Muslim caravans were repeatedly plundered by infidel pirates claiming redemption. Peaceful pilgrims were stripped of their possessions by Christians. They used force to drive Muslims from their ancestral lands, seizing the fertile soil of Tunisia for themselves. They severed land and sea; only birds could fly safely over Tunis. But today, Tunis and Kairouan have returned to the hands of Muslims who truly love this land, shifting from an era of war to an era of peace.

In his early years, he studied in Baghdad, influenced by the teachings of Al-Ghazali, and also studied under Ash'ari and Mu'tazila scholars, gradually forming his own religious views—a blend of Ash'arism and Sufi ideas, which can be classified as Zahirism. The core of Ibn Tumart's doctrine was an extreme form of Tawhid (monotheism), asserting that God possesses only one attribute, and considering other attributes as potentially polytheistic and contradictory to Tawhid. He advocated predestination, supported Sharia law, and opposed anthropomorphism. Ibn Tumart opposed the Maliki school of the Almoravid dynasty, criticizing its overemphasis on later juristic consensus (ijma) while neglecting the Sunnah and Hadith, and deemed the legal reasoning of Maliki jurists illegitimate, even potentially heretical. He attributed the corrupt practices of the Maghrebis to Almoravid rule, such as the public sale of wine and pork, which are prohibited by the Quran, or other behaviors he opposed. He also opposed religious art. Ibn Tumart's followers called themselves 'al-Muwahhidun,' meaning 'those who affirm the oneness of God.' His ideology can be summarized as 'a complex Islamic syncretic sect, combining Hadith scholarship, Zahiri and Shafi'i jurisprudence, Al-Ghazali's social conduct, and the Shi'a concepts of the Imam and Mahdi.' It gradually moved away from mysticism, placing greater emphasis on logical and rational academic methods to expound its theological positions, especially after the era of Caliph al-Mansur.

Initially, both the prince and the former queen were to be expelled from the court, but because the new queen remained childless, the prince was forcibly retained to ensure the succession. The struggle between the Crown Prince Faction and the Queen Faction represented the conflict between the Bulgarian nobility and the Serbian garrison. The Queen heavily appointed Serbs as her confidants, winning their loyalty with high positions and riches, keeping the Bulgarian faction consistently at a disadvantage. However, as Serbian royal authority declined, infighting among the nobility replaced a unified royal voice. Despite the Queen's adept political maneuvering, divisions among the Serbs continued to widen. Prince Konstantin was waiting for an opportunity.\n\nDuring the crusade launched by King Władysław III of Poland against the Ottoman Rumelia, the Serbian Emperor initially promised the Catholic crusaders passage through his lands to attack the Ottoman Empire. But, swayed by Ottoman persuasion, he betrayed the crusaders, cutting off their supplies and closing his gates to the remnants of the crusader army, eliminating their last chance of victory. This betrayal brought the Serbian Empire infamy in Europe but little territorial gain, though Mehmed II did send many treasures to Belgrade—mostly spoils from the Battle of Thessaloniki. Emperor Stefan cared little for Latin opinion; in his view, he had once again defended the Serbian Empire's hegemony in the Balkans, and that was all that mattered.\n\nIn 1444, the flames of rebellion led by the Albanian leader Skanderbeg against Serbia grew fiercer. Serbian troops within Bulgaria were heavily redeployed. The Prince knew the time was ripe. On the night of November 10th, the Prince led his troops to surround the royal palace.

EDG_flavorMLO.0.d:0 "Marriage alliances, intrigue, patronage, and coalition-building—the rise of the House of Visconti is inseparable from these terms. Before expelling the della Torre family from Milan in 1262, the Visconti were an obscure family from Genoa. They seized this heart of Lombardy through their own machinations, becoming the Empire's greatest prince in Italy. Of course, this Duke of Lombardy was not content with being merely the master of little Lombardy; he aspired to be the master of all Italy. In 1395, Duke Gian Visconti ascended after poisoning his infamous uncle, Duke Bernabò. When he visited the Imperial court, the Emperor appointed him as his agent in Italy, a clear gesture of favor. Duke Gian naturally valued the Emperor's goodwill; the imperial privilege greatly facilitated his expansion in Italy. Numerous towns in Northern Italy swiftly fell to his armies. The Visconti were just one step away from ruling Northern Italy, with Venice and Florence as the last bastions of resistance. But fate was cruel; a plague took his life.\n\nThe rapid expansion of Lombardy eventually provoked widespread hostility within the Empire. Although traditionally an ally of the Emperor, internal turmoil in Lombardy dealt a near-fatal blow to this nascent hegemony. The second son, Filippo, poisoned his mentally unstable elder brother and usurped the title of Duke of Lombardy. To reclaim his father's status, he reversed previous policies and maintained close cooperation with the guilds, granting guild leaders noble titles in exchange for their 'contributions.' The gold obtained from the guilds flowed freely into the pockets of mercenaries. Since 1414, Filippo had almost entirely restored his father's position. Modena, Ferrara, Montferrat, and Bologna, which had once formed a coalition against him, had submitted. The Republic of Verona became a puppet of Lombardy. To win him over, the Emperor transferred the Electorate title from the insubordinate Archbishop of Mainz to the Archbishop of Milan, who was completely under Visconti control, and also granted Lombardy the title 'Viceroy of Italy.' He was, in effect, informally recognized as the King of Italy, achieving what even his father could not.\n\nDuke Filippo relied on the guilds to extract wealth from Italy, and the guilds, in turn, demanded power from the Duke. Among the academies established by the Duke, a group of scholars advocated learning from ancient Greek arts and establishing an 'ideal state' ruled by philosophers, with those above setting an example for those below. Their ideas found a receptive audience in Lombardy. Philosophers could not possibly covet the Visconti throne, but the Duke himself did not mind presenting himself as a philosopher. In 1440, Lombardy convened its first 'Council of the Wise,' chaired by the Duke himself, with participants including scholars from the Milan Academy and distinguished figures from various autonomous cities, backed by the guilds of those cities and the merchant class that composed them.\n\nThe basic order in Plato's Republic consists of the ruling class, the military class, and the producing class. In Italy, the ruling and military classes were closely linked, so the three classes were: the ruling class—the King of Lombardy and the military group loyal to him; the Church; and the 'Wise Men' supported by the merchant guilds. The so-called social elites, whom Plato deemed most fit to govern—the philosophers—formed the Council of the Wise, funded by the guilds, acting as the voice of the producing guilds. The leader of the state should not only be a ruler but also a member of the philosophers. This does not mean that the philosophical faction represented by the guilds had already seized the Lombard throne at the outset; rather, it was the Visconti's way of courting the capitalist industrial and commercial cities, which differed from the Greek city-states. Through unified guilds, the commercial cities in their capitalist infancy in Lombardy possessed a higher level of power than the free cities in the German lands. They were not just autonomous entities; they could also influence the political structure of the kingdom above the city. A trinity relationship formed among the King of Lombardy, the guilds, and the philosophers."

After two months of arduous fighting, Florence halted the fierce momentum of the Milanese invasion at Scarperia and forced them to retreat to Bologna. Visconti still schemed to organize a new offensive but died of illness in 1354 before he could act, making this a military disgrace for Lombardy—now we have finally breached Florence's high walls, and the property and artworks of the Florentine citizens have become our spoils."

EDG_flavorMLO.17.d:0 "Leonardo da Vinci was commissioned to create a masterpiece for Lombardy. It is said that da Vinci would climb the scaffolding early each morning and begin working without pause. Sometimes he would toil there from dawn till dusk, brush constantly in hand. He painted incessantly, often forgetting to eat or drink. At other times, he would go for days without touching his brush, standing for hours before his work with arms crossed over his chest, critically examining the figures alone. There were also occasions when, at the height of the midday sun, he would abruptly set down the clay model he was working on as if suddenly remembering urgent business, leaving the Palazzo Vecchio and rushing straight to the Santa Maria delle Grazie. Without seeking shade or rest, he would quickly ascend the scaffolding, apply a brushstroke or two to the wall, then immediately turn and depart.\n\nThrough the master's diligent work, The Last Supper was finally completed. This painting depicts the scene from the Bible where Jesus shares his final meal with the twelve apostles. In this work, da Vinci masterfully captures the highly expressive moment after Jesus suddenly announces 'One of you will betray me,' portraying the disciples' various reactions - shock, anger, suspicion, and self-defense - with exquisite detail. Their gestures, glances, and behaviors are all rendered with remarkable precision and vividness, making this the most famous of all works created on this subject."

An angel behind Jesus completes the triangular composition, with gestures creating a responsive interaction between the figures. The background features a deep, mystical grotto adorned with plants, illuminated by light filtering through the cave openings. Although the subject matter is traditional, the expressive technique and compositional arrangement demonstrate the profound depth of da Vinci's artistry. The subtle depiction of the figures and background, the use of sfumato, scientific realism, and the application of techniques such as perspective and foreshortening, indicate that he had reached a new level in handling the dialectical relationship between realistic verisimilitude and artistic refinement."

While da Vinci was deeply engrossed in scientific and technological research, his artistic output was relatively limited, producing only some preliminary sketches featuring the Virgin, Jesus, and John the Baptist. For instance, he began work on 'The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John' for the main altar of the Santissima Annunziata church.

After the House of Di Savoia lost Savoy to the Cathars and its transformation into a republic, they were reduced to impoverished nobles surviving as mercenaries. Yet in 1437, their destiny was rewritten once more. That year, the Golden Horde, embroiled in rebellion and harassed by the Zaporizhian Hetmanate, grew severely weakened. Genoese Doge Isnardo Garco deemed this a perfect opportunity for expansion along the Black Sea coast. To extend Genoese influence in the region, the Doge hired Filiberto of Di Savoia to assault the Black Sea littoral. As the Golden Horde was stretched thin, Filiberto swiftly captured a significant territory around Azov. However, Filiberto informed the Doge by letter that despite his successive victories, he was still short-handed and required reinforcements. Doge Isnardo assembled a Genoese force to assist Filiberto, who returned to Genoa in 1439 bearing news of triumph. Unbeknownst to the Doge, Filiberto had, through military exploits, prestige, bribery, and other means, gained control over the army composed of his mercenaries and Genoese citizens, and proceeded to occupy the Republic of Genoa, becoming its de facto ruler. Filiberto preserved Genoa's existing state institutions but created a lifelong office for himself, effectively controlling all other government bodies. Furthermore, his regime heavily relied on his mercenary company, to whom he granted numerous benefits, while continuously recruiting mercenaries from other parts of Italy. When Filiberto died in 1443, his son Carlo di Savoia established a hereditary office for himself titled 'Duke', sparking discontent among Genoa's republican factions and triggering a rebellion. The rebels established a stronghold in Liguria but were ultimately suppressed by Carlo. Although Carlo consolidated his rule in Genoa, having devoted all his forces to quelling the domestic uprising, his overseas territories were lost one by one: the Corsicans revolted, established an independent republic, and sought the support of the Holy Roman Emperor; Despot Theodore III of Morea captured Genoa's strongholds in the Aegean Sea; and Nikephoros and Theodoro of the Doukas family led forces to seize the Republic's territories along the Black Sea coast.

EDG_flavorFRA.7.t:0 "Jacques Cœur"
EDG_flavorFRA.7.d:0 "Jacques Cœur came from a 'humble' artisan family; his father was a furrier who supplied the households of Duke Jean de Berry and the Dauphin. His hometown had hosted a chamber of accounts since 1379. In a France that did not cherish wealth and individual success, history seemed destined to block Jacques Cœur's irresistible rise. The France of Charles VII was a traditional kingdom plagued by complex monetary relationships. Thus emerged the legend of a man who single-handedly challenged the establishment, drawing inspiration from the great families of the Italian city-states to understand the mechanisms of wealth accumulation through large-scale trade. He likely became a thorn in the side of the nobility and administrative officials, who failed to recognize his genius, making him a man born in the wrong place at the wrong time. As early as the 15th and 16th centuries, poets and other historians expressed the view that France neither valued individual achievement nor recognized personal merit.\n\nFor the Kingdom of France, however, Jacques Cœur's trajectory and success marked a crucial turning point. Frenchmen donned the attire of corsairs, and the substantial number of foreign vessels in their fleets demonstrated that French political, economic, and military circles understood routes and commodities. Simply put, it proved their commitment to large-scale international trade: the French, too, could profit from it. They properly integrated France into the 'world map' of the era, and Jacques Cœur was one of these pioneers. He particularly established close ties with the Levant and its products, as well as with the powerful figures of the Italian peninsula—kings, popes, great merchants, and city-state lords. He exhibited tremendous energy and conspicuous success. Jacques Cœur also demonstrated an ability to establish relays among the populace to ensure smooth business operations and circulation. Even if the scale of his enterprises didn't match those of contemporary Tuscan merchants and bankers, he maintained numerous couriers along the routes of France and Europe at key waypoints. His presence extended from the Mediterranean to the North Sea coastlines. This revealed that 'entrepreneurship' could also thrive in the Kingdom of France, where many were capable of leading or participating in various financial and commercial ventures. France was integrating with the world.\n\nIn 1438, he was appointed the King's Argentier (financial minister). The authority he wielded allowed him to maintain advantages in numerous industries, such as the salt trade. Through alliances and political maneuvering, he engaged in economic activities and cultivated partners, building his operations within a favorable international context.\n\nJacques Cœur's residence, the 'Grande Maison,' was situated in the heart of Bourges. Its construction revealed that within the Kingdom of France—a realm experiencing less warfare and a climate more conducive to commercial development—it was possible to accumulate wealth relatively rapidly. The construction began in 1443 and concluded in 1451; its preservation has made it a symbol of Gothic architecture in world heritage today. For those with an 'entrepreneurial spirit' like Jacques Cœur, this kingdom held boundless possibilities. His palace stood as a symbol, though for some it was overly audacious, representing the economic and social ascent of a parvenu."

Realizing that the previous policy of persecution, embodied in the Edicts of Châteaubriant and Compiègne, had failed, the King and his ministers changed tactics, distinguishing for the first time between heretics and rebels.

Another victory for the Protestants was the reaffirmation of abolishing the death penalty for cases of heresy. In its most fundamental aspect, the edict confirmed France's ban on Protestant worship. However, numerous moderate concessions were made, to the extent that hardliners were considered to have lost the debate. Firstly, corporal punishment was abolished as a penalty for the crime of heresy. Private and public religious assemblies also remained forbidden, with property confiscation as the penalty. Yet, reinforcing the April 19 ordinance, laypeople were prohibited from investigating what happened in their neighbors' homes; only the police could handle such matters. The provision from Romorantin, which made heresy solely a crime for ecclesiastical courts, was approved again. While Romorantin technically left the door open for the death penalty by transferring sentencing from the Church to secular courts, this loophole was now closed. Exile was the harshest punishment for heresy, and false accusers would suffer the same penalty their target would have faced if guilty. An amnesty was granted for past religious offenses committed without carrying arms, and a gun ban for urban areas was instituted, with a penalty of 50 crowns. Carrying daggers or swords was forbidden unless one was a gentleman."

This 'lag' in the emergence of the Renaissance in France was primarily due to the fact that capitalist development in France at the time still trailed behind Italy, and the necessary social conditions were not yet mature.\n\nThe French expeditions into Italy greatly accelerated the development of the French Renaissance. The French who followed the 'knightly king' across the Alps discovered with astonishment a new world on the other side: magnificent cities built with various marbles, grand piazzas, palaces rivaling those of the Orient, and golden-domed churches...\n\nSimultaneously, the new urban lifestyles and immense wealth of the Italian cities filled these Frenchmen with envy. Although the French ultimately gained no lasting territorial conquests in Italy during the decades-long Italian Wars, the vast quantities of Italian Renaissance artworks and books plundered during the conflicts opened the eyes of their countrymen back home, thereby significantly promoting the spread of humanist thought in France."

From 1492 to 1506, he published several translations of Aristotle's works with his own annotations. He was also the first in France to liberate religious studies from the constraints of scholastic philosophy. His 1509 Latin translation of the New Testament, along with his Commentary on the Pauline Epistles which contained fundamental ideas of the Reformation, exerted a significant influence on Luther. Beginning in 1512, Lefèvre dedicated himself to promoting 'salvation by faith' and a 'return to the Scriptures.' That year, he became the vicar general of Meaux and organized the famous 'Circle of Meaux,' actively disseminating Protestant ideas. In 1530, Lefèvre translated the entire Bible from the Vulgate into French, an undertaking that made a monumental contribution to the popularization of the French national language."

That same year, he also founded a library at Fontainebleau dedicated to housing ancient manuscripts, an institution later regarded as a precursor to the National Library. To better house artworks, many of which were sourced from Italy, Francis I also undertook major construction projects to expand the Louvre Palace. Concurrently, he enthusiastically invited prominent Italian humanists and artists to France to lecture and practice their crafts, including the illustrious Leonardo da Vinci. Furthermore, Francis I publicly declared his intention to grant literature his 'support and special favor.' These actions led some French humanists to hail him as the 'Father of French Letters.' Compared to Francis I, his sister, Margaret of Navarre, exhibited even more pronounced humanist leanings.

The full title was exceedingly long: The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua. Upon publication, the book was well-received by readers and quickly became popular throughout the country. This novel constitutes the second part of Gargantua and Pantagruel. Two years later, Rabelais published the first part of the series, originally titled The Very Horrific Life of the Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel. Subsequently, Rabelais spent many more years composing and publishing the final three parts of the work. In this humanist masterpiece, drawing on French folklore, Rabelais used exaggeration to vividly, humorously, and wittily celebrate the greatness of human power, while satirizing the Church, which preached asceticism, and the idle, complacent nobility. The author also exhaustively expressed the bourgeoisie's fervent desire to break free from spiritual bondage and pursue new ideas and knowledge. An inscription in the book records the oracle of the 'Divine Bottle': 'Drink freely, drink from the fountain of knowledge, study man and the universe... Study knowledge, drink truth, drink love.' As a representative of humanist literature in the early French Renaissance, Rabelais held strong democratic tendencies, which stood in sharp contrast to the aristocratic airs of the poets from the Pléiade, his contemporaries."

The group's aim was to elevate the French language, as a tool for literary expression, to the level of the classical languages. The manifesto of the Pléiade was undoubtedly The Defence and Illustration of the French Language ( La Défense et Illustration de la Langue Française ), penned by Du Bellay and published in 1549. This historic work, spanning what was conceptually 12 books and 24 chapters, explicitly proposed carefully imitating and drawing inspiration from the works of the Italian Renaissance and classical literary forms and languages to purify, standardize, and enrich the French language. The manifesto also advocated for the use of specialized terminology in literary works, the creation of new words, and the development of poetic forms within French literature. Its authors confidently believed that French literature should at least rival Italian literature and that French could be used to create poetry worthy of comparison with ancient verse. Although the members of the Pléiade viewed literary creation as the exclusive privilege of the aristocratic class, which inevitably imbued their linguistic and poetic theories, as well as their creative practice, with inherent conservative and aristocratic biases, their primary theoretical tenets nonetheless reflected the demands of the era: linguistic unity and reform. This aspect not only aligned with the historical trend of national strength and unification but also, to some extent, 'defended' and 'illustrated' the humanist ideas driving societal and epochal progress. Precisely in this sense, the theoretical propositions and creative practices of the Pléiade are still recognized as an important component of French humanist literature."

EDG_flavorFRA.20.d:0 "The most important humanist writer of the late French Renaissance was Montaigne. He was born into a family of noblesse de robe; his ancestors had amassed wealth by running a fish shop in Bordeaux and exporting wine to England. Montaigne's father had participated in the Italian Wars and consequently became an ardent admirer of Italian culture. Although the elder Montaigne was not versed in literature, being eager to cultivate sophistication, he was determined to provide his son with an excellent education. Since Latin was the common language of scholars and men of letters at the time, the father had his son speak Latin as his native tongue from the moment he began to babble. Subsequently, he spared no effort in ensuring his son received a good and systematic education. As a result, Montaigne acquired a profound erudition, particularly familiarity with the works of ancient masters such as Plutarch, Seneca, and Tacitus. This is fully evidenced in his Essays, where he extensively quotes from numerous ancient Greek and Roman writers. In his adulthood, Montaigne served as a magistrate and was twice elected Mayor of Bordeaux. Additionally, he served as a courtier to King Henry III in Paris. Later, weary of public life, Montaigne retired to his estate in the countryside and devoted himself to writing. The immortal work that made Montaigne famous is his Essays (Les Essais). The Essays are the most important prose work of 16th-century France, and indeed of the world, comprising 107 chapters and approximately a million words. The chapters vary in length, and their content is incredibly diverse, covering virtually every topic. Although the book's structure is loose and natural, a clear view of the whole reveals that the theory of human nature is the ideological foundation of Montaigne's thought. Unlike early humanists like Rabelais, Montaigne did not enthusiastically, even exaggeratedly, praise human greatness and power or celebrate human liberation. Instead, he calmly reflected on and explored humanity and human life. In this process, Montaigne placed great emphasis on self-study—the objective description and serious dissection of the self. Montaigne believed that self-study was the school for cultivating humanity. Simultaneously, he emphasized that self-reflection and self-restraint could grant a person spiritual independence. However, the 'self' in Montaigne's writing is not an isolated 'self' but a universal one. He declared, 'Every man bears the whole stamp of the human condition.' Thus, he naturally expanded the study of the self to the study of humankind. As for the attitude a humanist should hold towards earthly life, Montaigne's answer was: 'I love life... I embrace it wholeheartedly and am grateful to Nature for all she has wrought for me.'"

Since their 'adherence' to Calvinism was largely politically motivated, they were also called 'political Huguenots.' After Calvin's rise, the vast majority of French Protestants became Calvinist Protestants. Calvinism spread throughout France via Lyon. Because it incorporated the fundamental doctrines of Lutheranism while discarding and modifying the parts where Luther had compromised with feudal lords, it better reflected the bourgeoisie's desires for economic prosperity and political participation. Consequently, it garnered strong support from the broad French bourgeoisie, especially the middle and lower bourgeoisie. During the 1550s, Calvinist churches were established across France. In May 1559, at Calvin's initiative, representatives from various new churches held the first 'National Synod of the Reformed Church of France' in Saint-Germain, on the outskirts of Paris."

During Richelieu's administration, the French treasury was noticeably replenished. However, while this phenomenon was somewhat linked to the aforementioned measures, it was also attributable to the regime's harsh oppression and exploitation of the populace. Richelieu's extortion from urban and rural dwellers knew no bounds. By the time of his death, national taxes had been collected three years in advance. Regarding this, Richelieu famously declared: 'If the people are too comfortable, they cannot be kept within the bounds of their duty... They must be treated like mules, burdened heavily, for ease will spoil them.' Precisely because of this, during Richelieu's rule, the vast numbers of peasants and urban commoners, unable to bear the government's exorbitant taxes and levies, rose in rebellion time and again.

Although he also wrote comedies, he was primarily a tragedian and was honored by his countrymen as the 'Father of Tragedy.' His masterpiece is Le Cid. Corneille was born in Rouen, a port city in Normandy. His grandfather was a councilor and keeper of the seals for the Parliament of Normandy, and his father served as a special administrator of waters and forests in the Vicomté of Rouen; his family had been well-off for several generations. Corneille received his early education at home and attended a Jesuit college from ages nine to fifteen. Intelligent and studious, he developed a great fondness for the tragedies of Seneca and the orations of Cicero, also showing a strong interest in Latin poetry. Since his teachers were all devout Catholics, including some notable preachers, Corneille was deeply influenced by Catholicism from a young age, which later imbued many of his works with strong religious overtones. At that time, Rouen was a center for French theater with a vibrant cultural life. Important troupes from Paris frequently performed there, and most French plays in the early 17th century were printed in Rouen. Influenced by this environment, Corneille developed a great interest in drama and began writing plays. In 1629, his first comedy, Mélite, was published. Frankly, it was not an extraordinary work, but its plot was close to life and the dialogue was cleverly constructed. The famous actor Montdory (1594-1651) took the script to Paris and staged it. The performance was successful, marking Corneille's debut. Over the next five or six years, he completed three more comedies, three tragicomedies, and his first tragedy, Médée (1635), based largely on the plot of Seneca's tragedy of the same name. It was from this point that Corneille's career as a tragedian began. Overall, the subjects of these early works were not ideal, and the characters lacked vitality. However, compared to the chaotic works that flooded the stage at the time, his plays were simpler in style and stronger in contemporary relevance, displaying distinctive characteristics. Cardinal Richelieu, seeking to tighten government control over literature and art to further consolidate central power, was scouting for writers to serve the crown. Corneille's refreshing plays caught his attention. In 1635, Richelieu recruited Corneille into a five-member writing team he personally directed to produce comedies. From then on, Corneille received a substantial annual pension and gained access to high-society salons."

Racine's most famous works include Andromaque, Britannicus, and Bérénice. Molière can be considered the foremost representative of 17th-century French Classical comedy. Molière wrote dozens of comedies in his lifetime, among the most celebrated are 'Tartuffe', 'The Miser', 'The Affected Young Ladies', and 'Don Juan'. In the feudal era, artists, like other artisans who were dependent on patronage, held little status or dignity. Racine's final masterpiece, Phèdre, was attacked by conservative nobles for its 'immorality' and suspended from performance. Although the King intervened to settle the matter, Racine stopped writing for the stage for twelve years, serving as the royal historiographer at the court of Louis XIV. In 1689, at the request of Madame de Maintenon, he wrote Esther and Athalie.

EDG_flavorFRA.36.d:0 "La Fontaine was the most outstanding fabulist of 17th-century France, renowned for his masterpiece, the Fables, written in epigrammatic verse. Comprising approximately 240 fables, the work draws heavily on Aesop's Fables and Eastern tales. Because they are not only beautifully and vividly written but also profound in meaning and rich in philosophy, the Fables have remained a celebrated classic in France, appreciated by scholars and common folk alike, since their publication. La Fontaine overcame the inherent allegorical nature and dry moralizing of the fable genre, developing its artistic, imagistic elements to the greatest extent, thereby transforming the genre. Many contemporaries criticized these innovations, being accustomed to viewing fables as merely instructive tales. They felt La Fontaine's attempt to 'embellish' fables with verse weakened their distinct and clear didactic purpose. The critic Belinsky, speaking of Krylov's fables, once said: 'A fable is not an allegory, nor should it be one. If it is a good, poetic fable, it should be a short story or a little drama with characters and typical personalities, all depicted through poetry.' This view can also be applied to La Fontaine's fables. La Fontaine masterfully employed concise structures and the skill of selecting artistic details, adeptly using the richness of popular language and flexibly utilizing free verse meters. By dramatizing the fables, he vastly expanded their expressive possibilities. The plots in La Fontaine's fables typically unfold from within. For the fabulist La Fontaine, the driving force of the plot is the inherent character and motivation specific to his protagonists (as individuals and types). Therefore, in La Fontaine's works, the traditional moral lesson, presented in verse either at the beginning or the end of the fable, often conveys a narrower idea than the overall objective thought contained within the entire poem. Sometimes this moral is omitted entirely or placed in the mouth of a character, thereby becoming a means of characterizing that figure."

While this increased state revenue and enriched the nobility and bourgeoisie, it placed a heavier burden on the general populace. Beyond the direct exploitation by the tax farmers, the interest on public debt and the salaries of officials were paid from the state budget, which primarily relied on taxes from the urban and rural laboring classes. At that time, France had the heaviest national taxes in Europe. Many peasants, crushed by the weight of rent, debt, and taxes, were forced to sell their tenant lands, leading to the emergence of a destitute class in the countryside and frequent anti-tax protests.

From the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, all bowed to Charlemagne's authority.\n\nYet Charlemagne's glory belonged to Charlemagne alone, not to his three heirs: Charles, Pippin, and Louis. After the death of Louis the Pious in 840, his son Lothair became the sole ruler, but in 843, his three sons decided to partition the Frankish Empire through the Treaty of Verdun. The empire was further subdivided multiple times thereafter: by the Treaty of Prüm in 855, the Treaty of Meerssen in 870, and the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. After Charlemagne's death, his empire fragmented time and again; his authority was buried with him. The legend seemed to become an unattainable myth, and the Frankish Empire was never unified again.\n\nThe various parts of the empire developed distinct customs, cultures, and languages, evolving into independent states. For a time, people still referred to the divided realms as the East Frankish Kingdom, Middle Francia, and the West Frankish Kingdom, but these designations faded about a century later with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty. Only the western 'France' continued to use the name 'Frankish,' while the East Frankish Kingdom evolved into the Holy Roman Empire, maintaining the tradition of the Roman Emperor.\n\nAlthough the era of the Frankish Empire has passed, as the undisputed heirs of Charlemagne, we must inevitably claim our right—to rule Europa."

Therefore, the Capetian dynasty enthusiastically spread its branches across the land, establishing cadet branches in various regions to prevent another powerful noble from wresting the throne from the Capetians. Admittedly, the relationship between the main line and the cadet branches grew less amicable as blood ties thinned over time. The cadet branches controlled regional power, while the King of France was confined to the small Île-de-France. However, due to the balance of power among the princes and the continuous vitality of the main Capetian line, no single prince attempted to seize the supreme throne, though their shared paternal ancestry with the French king granted them a natural right to claim it. The French king urgently needed a force obedient to the crown to counterbalance his increasingly autonomous kinsmen.\n\nIn AD 942, due to longstanding border conflicts and personal enmities, the King of Lotharingia incited the Duke of Burgundy to oppose the French king, but ultimately failed. Lotharingia not only lost Burgundy as an ally but also saw the Flanders region seized by the French king.\n\nYet the French monarchy still faced many obstacles. The English king slipped from Paris's control, and southern France, due to the Cathar movement, fell entirely outside the French king's rule. Knightly nobles centered in Flanders and Burgundy formed the League of the Public Weal, seeking greater autonomy or even independence from the French crown.\n\nThe French king's centralizing tendencies naturally provoked dissatisfaction and rebellion among his vassals. In 1428, dissatisfied with the French king's attempts to marginalize him and incited by the Kings of England and Lotharingia, the Duke of Alençon declared his allegiance to England. King Hugues VI of France dispatched troops in an attempt to seize Alençon and simultaneously reclaim Normandy, but he faced obstacles both internal and external.

Since Ludwig VII's mother was a member of the Capetian dynasty, he forced Hugues VI to sign the 'Treaty of Caen,' which required Hugues VI to disinherit the French Dauphin Hugues VII and designate Ludwig VII as the heir to the French throne. Hugues VI soon died from infection, and Ludwig VII claimed the French throne, intending to be crowned King of France at Reims. Shortly thereafter, English forces landed in Normandy, and Arles launched an invasion from the south.\n\nThe Dauphin Hugues accepted his mandate in this crisis, but found himself attacked from all sides and stretched thin. Just as King Ludwig VII of Lotharingia reached Reims, unexpectedly, a peasant girl from Orléans named Jeanne d'Arc led soldiers loyal to the Dauphin in closing Reims's gates and resisting the Lotharingian assault. This caused King Ludwig to miss his optimal window for coronation at Reims and forced him to return to his own lands to suppress rebellions among his German lords. In the subsequent war, the Dauphin Hugues successfully crowned himself King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, with Jeanne d'Arc guarding his side and repelling attacks from the Lotharingians, English, and Arlesians until 1444. This prolonged conflict was later termed the 'Four Kingdoms' War' by historians. To retaliate against the French, the English bribed the Papacy, leading to Jeanne d'Arc being condemned as a heretic.\n\nAs for France in 1444, the Capetian crown still shone brightly, and Hugues VII's military victories against foreign invaders had earned him great prestige.

Consequently, by the latter half of the 15th century, the monarchy had strengthened to the point where it maintained a standing army, the compagnies d'ordonnance, commanded by the nobility, and could levy taxes directly without the control of any representative assembly. The emergence of a limited royal army further enhanced the economic privileges of the nobility, as the institutionalization of the taille guaranteed them full fiscal immunity for the first time.

Hugues VI soon died from infection, and Ludwig VII claimed the French throne, intending to be crowned King of France at Reims. Although King Ludwig VII's attempt to claim the French throne ultimately failed, the invasion he launched in 1429 plunged France into a severe crisis. The Four Kingdoms' War lasted for a decade, devastating the Kingdom of France and fostering immense hatred towards Lotharingia.

By positioning cannons at the streets leading into the Place de la Concorde and using thunderous volleys of grapeshot, he successfully suppressed a rebellion against the Republic. Yet, such a valiant feat was but a minor accomplishment in his military career. As he accumulated victories on the battlefield, he quickly entered the view of the Republic's highest echelons. Ultimately, he seized the olive branch extended by the Senator Sieyès. Together with allies like Sieyès, Moreau, and his own brother Lucien, he executed a successful coup.

Following Marat's assassination by a Girondin supporter, Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobin Montagnards exploited the public sentiment to incite crowds to storm the National Convention, attempting to overthrow the Girondins. They advocated for the widespread arrest of 'royalists and counter-revolutionaries hiding within the National Convention and the Republic,' demanding they pay for their crimes. Of course, the 'streamlined' judicial procedures, while efficiently dealing with royalists, also opened the door wide for widespread purges and guilt by association...\n\nThe radical faction represented by Robespierre rose to power in the National Convention.

In the Revolutionary period, he became a colonel commanding the National Guard at Versailles and staunchly opposed the Reveillons. Later, he served as Chief of Staff for the Revolutionary Army in the Vendée, where he was wounded in action. After the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794, he became Chief of Staff to General Kellermann in the Army of the Alps.

On December 9, 1797, he assumed command of the Army of Italy, directing the occupation of Rome. In April 1798, he became Chief of Staff of the Army of the East under Napoleon's command.

On October 5, 1795, to quell a royalist insurrection, Murat, under the orders of General Napoleon Bonaparte, transported 40 cannons from an artillery park outside Paris into the city.

His given name was Jean-Baptiste, to which he later added 'Jules' (derived from Julius Caesar) under the classicizing influence of the French Revolution. His family's original surname was de Pouey, changed to Bernadotte in the early 17th century. Bernadotte joined the French army on September 3, 1780, as a private in the Royal Marine Regiment, beginning his service in Corsica. After the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, his displayed military talent led to rapid promotion. By 1792, he was a colonel, and by 1794, a brigadier general in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. On June 26, 1794, serving under General Jourdan, Bernadotte played a significant role in the victory at the Battle of Fleurus, after which he became a général de division. In 1796, he was instrumental in the successful retreat of the French army across the Rhine after its defeat by Archduke Charles of Austria. In 1797, he was ordered to lead reinforcements from the Rhine front to Napoleon in Italy, performing exceptionally well at the Battle of the Tagliamento. In 1798, as ambassador to Vienna, he forced Austrian submission by threatening to leave after Austrians tore down the tricolor flag from the embassy. When Napoleon established the First French Empire, Bernadotte was among the eighteen generals created Marshals of the Empire. From June 1804 to September 1805, Bernadotte served as governor of the recently occupied Hanover. During the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, Bernadotte's I Corps, stationed in Hanover, cooperated with allied forces to encircle General Mack's Austrian army at Ulm.

On March 3, 1779, Davout's father died unexpectedly in a hunting accident. That autumn, he bid farewell to his mother and entered the École Militaire in Auxerre. On September 27, 1785, at just 15 years old, Davout began studies at the École Militaire in Paris; Napoleon Bonaparte, who would profoundly influence his life, had graduated from there on September 1st of the same year. After graduating in 1788, Davout joined his father's old regiment as a second lieutenant. In 1790, the noble-born Davout was arrested for participating in anti-royalist uprisings. Released in 1791, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Volunteer Battalion. He led this battalion at the Battle of Neerwinden on March 18, 1793. He was forced to leave his post in August. Returning to active service in 1794, he commanded a cavalry brigade in the Army of the Rhine from 1795 to 1797, holding the rank of brigadier general at the age of 25. He was captured by Prussian forces at the Battle of Mannheim on September 20, 1795, and was released in a prisoner exchange. On March 28, 1798, recommended by his friend General Desaix, Davout was summoned by Napoleon to join the Expedition to Egypt. In Egypt, he commanded a cavalry brigade and performed excellently at the Battle of the Pyramids on July 21. On January 22, 1799, General Desaix's 5,000 French troops encountered 13,000 Mamluk forces at Samhud; Davout led a sudden and fierce cavalry charge after the enemy was exhausted by the French infantry squares, routing them completely. On February 12, Davout alone led the 22nd Chasseurs à Cheval and the 15th Dragoon Regiments to defeat Egyptian cavalry again at Tif. He also fought at the Battle of Abukir on July 25. With Napoleon's return to France and the assassination of the succeeding commander General Kléber, the expeditionary force found itself in a difficult position and eventually surrendered to the British on terms allowing their return to France. In 1800, while returning to France, the French troops were detained by the British navy; Davout and other generals were released a month later. Promoted to général de division on July 3, he was appointed to command the cavalry of the Army of Italy. In July 1801, he became Inspector General of Cavalry and commander of the Consular Guard. This sudden favor is believed to be related to the death of General Desaix at the Battle of Marengo, a way for Napoleon to honor Desaix's memory. In 1803, he was tasked with training recruits at the Camp de Bruges. On May 19, 1804, the 34-year-old Davout was promoted by Napoleon I to Marshal of the Empire and Commander of the Imperial Guard, also receiving the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour. He was the youngest of all the Marshals of the First French Empire."

Promoted to colonel in April 1798, he joined Napoleon's Egyptian Expedition, fighting with great bravery at the Siege of Acre and the Battle of Abukir, earning distinction. Returning to Europe with Napoleon, he participated in the Battle of Marengo as second-in-command of the Guard cavalry. He was promoted to général de division in September 1802. In 1804, he was created a Marshal of France and appointed colonel-general of the Cavalry of the Imperial Guard (in 1805, 1806, and 1807).

EDG_flavorFRA_revolution.10.desc:0 "Auguste Marmont was born on July 20, 1774, in Châtillon-sur-Seine, Burgundy. His father was a retired royal official who owned an ironworks. Marmont entered artillery school in his youth and after graduation was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1792, promoted to captain a year later. During the Siege of Toulon in 1793, Marmont caught the attention of the artillery commander, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the two became close friends. Marmont remained loyal to Napoleon even during his period of disgrace following false accusations. In 1794, he was transferred to the Army of Italy, serving under General Desaix and participating in the Battle of Mainz in October 1795. In 1796, after Napoleon took command of the Army of Italy, Marmont was promoted to major and served as his aide-de-camp. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Lodi on May 10 and later at the Battle of Castiglione on August 5, where he decisively moved twelve heavy cannons to the front line for concentrated fire, rapidly destroying Austrian fortifications and capturing the crucial Medole Plateau. He returned to Paris in October and was soon promoted to colonel. In 1798, Marmont joined Napoleon's Egyptian Expedition as a staff officer. At the capture of Malta, he led from the front, personally seizing the standard of the Knights of St. John, and was promoted to brigadier general. In Egypt, he fought at the Battle of Alexandria on July 2 and, after the city's capture, was appointed its governor. He also participated in the famous Battle of the Pyramids. The following year, Marmont returned to France with Napoleon and took part in the Coup of 18 Brumaire on November 9, 1799, becoming a member of the first new legislature. At the Battle of Marengo on June 14, 1800, initially outnumbered and having suffered heavy artillery losses—at one point only five guns remained operational—Marmont, upon receiving thirteen guns from reinforcements, concentrated all his artillery and launched a devastating bombardment against the resting Austrian troops, throwing their formations into disarray and enabling a French counter-attack that secured victory. On September 9, Marmont was promoted to général de division for his outstanding service."

For never has there been a historical event greater, more far-reaching, more thoroughly酝酿ed, yet more unpredictable. Even a genius like Frederick the Great failed to foresee this revolution's arrival. Although he encountered its precursors, he turned a blind eye. Not only that, he had already been acting in accordance with the revolutionary spirit. He was not merely a forerunner of the Revolution but could even be called its agent. Yet, when the Revolution approached, he failed to recognize it. And when it finally erupted, it displayed a character so distinct from previous revolutions, bearing a uniquely new visage, that it went unnoticed at first. Abroad, the French Revolution became a widely known event. It almost implanted in the hearts of all peoples a vague notion of a new era dawning, a朦胧 hope for change and reform, but no one could guess what the French Revolution truly looked like. Monarchs and ministers utterly lacked this faint premonition—the same premonition that made the people 'restless' upon the Revolution's outbreak. Initially, monarchs and ministers regarded the revolution merely as a periodic ailment, an illness hardly any nation's constitution could avoid, one that merely opened new political territory for neighboring states, with no further consequences. If they occasionally spoke the truth about the French Revolution, it was unintentional. In 1791, when the German princes gathered at Pillnitz, they did declare that the threat faced by the French monarchy was a common threat to all ancient regimes in Europe, that they, like France, faced a crisis. In reality, however, they did not believe this at all. Secret documents from the time reveal that for them, this was merely a pretext to conceal their intentions or to embellish them in public—they could not imagine, nor did they conceive, how earth-shattering this French Revolution would be, an event that would change the entire world."

Although Iran has always been great, there is no doubt that the current divided and fragmented state of Iran satisfies no one. The simultaneous existence of Turkic and Tajik ecological niches on Iranian land, along with the long-standing social divisions caused by the four major religions—Sunni, Shia, Christian, and Zoroastrian—have greatly hindered the political and economic development of Iranian civilization.

EDG_flavor_PER.12.t:0 "Persian Silk"
EDG_flavor_PER.12.d:0 "The Iranian plateau, situated along the middle stretch of the ancient Silk Road, serves as a bridge connecting East Asia and Europe. From very early times, trade has played a vital role in Iran's economy. However, during the Safavid period, changes began to emerge. With the advent of the Age of Exploration, traditional overland trade routes suffered some decline. Concurrently, instability in Central Asia and prolonged confrontation between the Safavid Dynasty and the Khanate of Bukhara made merchant security uncertain. After the reign of Tahmasp I, civil strife and external threats caused a further contraction in Safavid trade. Central Asian merchants increasingly opted for northern routes, traveling through Siberia to reach Astrakhan.\n\nSince Abbas's accession, financial constraints have persistently troubled him. His father, to win favor, frequently bestowed overly generous rewards upon court officials and Qizilbash emirs, worsening the already precarious finances of the Safavid Dynasty. The protracted war with the Ottomans required vast resources to maintain the army. Yet, the Iranian plateau, the core region of the state, is inherently barren, necessitating the import of many essential goods. At that time, Iran's primary trading partner was the Mughal Empire to the southeast. Unlike Iran, the Indian subcontinent is undeniably fertile and rich in resources, with a population nearly ten times that of Iran. Iranians had significant demand for Indian products such as sugar, rice, cotton cloth, indigo, and medicines but lacked sufficient exports to balance trade, forcing them to pay with precious metals. This was undoubtedly disadvantageous for Iran, which already suffered from a scarcity of gold and silver mines. Abbas issued decrees prohibiting the export of gold and silver, but these had little effect. He had to seek alternative means to earn gold and silver from other nations, and his success in this endeavor relied heavily on one commodity: raw silk.\n\nSericulture in Iran dates back to the 6th century AD, and by the 10th century at the latest, Iranians had developed local silkworm breeds adapted to the regional climate. Particularly along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea—in Shirvan, Gilan, and Mazandaran—the climate is suitable for mulberry growth, making it Iran's largest sericulture region. After the 16th century in Europe, silk products were no longer luxuries exclusive to the upper nobility and began to spread among urban residents. However, European domestic production of raw silk was insufficient, and the distant East's raw silk trade was monopolized by Portuguese merchants in Macau, primarily for trade with Japan. Iranian raw silk thus became highly sought after by European merchants, and Iran gradually became the largest supplier to the European raw silk market. Simultaneously, gold and silver from the Americas were flowing into Europe, conveniently meeting Abbas's needs.\n\nConsequently, Abbas implemented a series of measures to strengthen control over the raw silk trade. He broke with the approach of previous Iranian rulers over centuries toward the semi-autonomous minor powers on the Caspian coast, moving beyond a suzerain-vassal relationship to completely subjugate them, fully incorporating Mazandaran and Gilan into the royal domain. He then forcibly relocated thousands of sericulturists from the Caucasus to settle in these areas, entrusting them with silkworm cultivation."

At the age of two, he was appointed governor of Khorasan by Tahmasp I and placed under the tutelage of the powerful Turkmen noble, Ali Quli Khan of the Shamlu tribe. Historically, in September 1587, with the support of Murshid Quli Khan, Abbas traveled to Qazvin and deposed his father, Mohammad Khodabanda, who was suppressing a rebellion in the south. On October 1, Mohammad Khodabanda returned to Qazvin and agreed to abdicate. On October 16, Abbas formally ascended the throne as the fifth Shah of the Safavid dynasty, becoming known as Abbas I. The Iranian scholar Abbas Eqbal Ashtiani, in his Comprehensive History of Iran, assessed: 'His monumental achievements in expanding the realm and governing the state undoubtedly make him the greatest monarch of the Islamic period in Iran. In the hearts of the Iranian people, no other Iranian king can rival his reputation, as evidenced by the widespread circulation of stories and legends about him.'

In 1589, when Abbas I sought to secretly eliminate the powerful Murshid Quli Khan Ustajlu, Allahverdi Khan participated in the assassination plot against Ustajlu. For this, he was granted the title of Sultan and appointed governor of Golpayegan. He was later promoted to commander of the ghulam and, between 1595 and 1596, became one of the five most important officials in the Safavid government. Around the same time, Abbas I appointed him governor of Fars. He was the first ghulam officer whose status was considered equal to that of the Qizilbash emirs, signifying that provinces could no longer operate semi-autonomously or necessarily under Qizilbash control, but were instead governed by officials appointed directly by the Shah. Allahverdi Khan led Persian armies to numerous victories in campaigns east and west, including the conquest of Bahrain from 1601 to 1602, and oversaw the construction of many public works, such as the Si-o-seh Pol bridge over the Zayandeh River in Isfahan, which still bears his inscription today."

The origin of the name 'Qazvin' remains a partially understood puzzle. The renowned 14th-century geographer and historian Hamdallah Mustawfi Qazvini offered an explanation for the city's name in his writings. He claimed that a Sassanid general, while commanding operations against the Daylamites in southern Gilan on the Qazvin plain, noticed his soldiers' disorganized ranks and reprimanded a junior officer: 'Look at these crooked lines, straighten out the army quickly (An kash vin va lashkar rast kun).' Thus, the place was named 'Kashvin,' which later became Arabized after the Arab invasion to the now commonly used 'Qazvin.' Compared to the other three capitals of the Safavid dynasty—Ardabil, Tabriz, and Isfahan—Qazvin has fewer historical records and less urban influence, making it a relatively young royal capital. However, Qazvin's geographical location largely determined its economic development path. Situated south of the Caspian Sea, Qazvin served as a vital transportation hub on the Iranian plateau. The relocation of the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin endowed the city with significant importance, as major trade routes from the southeast to the southwest converged here. Qazvin lies on the route from Baghdad to Tehran and further along the Great Khorasan Road to the south, acting as a junction branching northwest towards Rasht and the port of Anzali. Furthermore, Qazvin connects the Khorasan Road with the Tabriz Road leading to Taqistan. Geographically, Qazvin links Tehran, Isfahan, the Persian Gulf, the Caspian region, and Anatolia, standing as a crucial city on both east-west and north-south transit routes."

This directly connected the eastern overland trade hub of Diyarbakir and the western commercial center of Izmir in the Ottoman Empire with Aleppo, the largest trading port on the eastern Mediterranean coast. With the cessation of large-scale foreign wars and the stabilization of the domestic political situation, the reign of Abbas I marked a peak in infrastructure construction for the Safavid Empire, leading to an unprecedented increase in the number of caravanserais built. The majority of the caravanserais constructed over the 200-plus years of the Safavid dynasty were concentrated during Abbas I's rule. According to the French traveler Jean Chardin's Travels in Persia, 1,082 caravanserais were built during Abbas I's era. Estimates vary regarding the total number throughout the entire Safavid period.

His successor, Husayn ibn Hamdan al-Khasibi, further developed the sect's doctrines and spread them into regions such as Aleppo in Syria.\n\nThe sect's teachings, influenced by Neoplatonism, Christianity, and Buddhist thought, and based on the doctrines of the Isma'ili scholar Abu al-Khattab, formed a syncretic religious ideology. Both Sunnis and Twelver Shi'as regard the sect as heterodox. The Alawites believe that Muhammad, Ali, Fatim (the masculine form of 'Fatima'), Hasan, and Husayn are emanations of the Creator. The Alawites have strict initiation rituals, requiring an oath of secrecy and acceptance of esoteric teachings from a mentor to enlighten the soul before participating in religious activities. Their religious elite are called 'Knowers of the Secrets,' and ordinary followers must show absolute obedience. In addition to celebrating Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, and Shi'a communal holidays, the sect also observes Christian Christmas and Easter, and includes communion and sacramental wine in their prayers.\n\nOver time, the Alawites gradually integrated with the local Druze community, achieving a high degree of unity between the sheikhs of both groups. They absorbed many ideas from the Renaissance and the Western European Reformation, gradually spreading throughout the Near East. Although the Alawites held significant influence in Syria and Egypt, they had not yet shaken the authority of the local rulers until a jurist named Fakhr al-Din began using his religious influence through various means to attempt to expand separatist sentiments within [Root.GetName], seeking independence for Syria and Egypt from [Root.GetName], and extending Alawite influence north to Tripoli and south to Safad, Tiberias, and Nazareth."

Yet in 1437, their destiny was rewritten once more. That year, the Golden Horde, embroiled in rebellion and harassed by the Zaporizhian Hetmanate, grew severely weakened. Genoese Doge Isnardo Garco deemed this a perfect opportunity for expansion along the Black Sea coast. To extend Genoese influence in the region, the Doge hired Filiberto of Di Savoia to assault the Black Sea littoral. As the Golden Horde was stretched thin, Filiberto swiftly captured a significant territory around Azov. However, Filiberto informed the Doge by letter that despite his successive victories, he was still short-handed and required reinforcements. Doge Isnardo assembled a Genoese force to assist Filiberto, who returned to Genoa in 1439 bearing news of triumph. Unbeknownst to the Doge, Filiberto had, through military exploits, prestige, bribery, and other means, gained control over the army composed of his mercenaries and Genoese citizens, and proceeded to occupy the Republic of Genoa, becoming its de facto ruler. Filiberto preserved Genoa's existing state institutions but created a lifelong office for himself, effectively controlling all other government bodies. Furthermore, his regime heavily relied on his mercenary company, to whom he granted numerous benefits, while continuously recruiting mercenaries from other parts of Italy. When Filiberto died in 1443, his son Carlo di Savoia established a hereditary office for himself titled 'Duke'. Now, the Duke of the House of Savoy encounters us once again.

Following the failures of the two Albigensian Crusades, the Cathar movement spread like wildfire through Occitania, unstoppable. Occitan-speaking peasants tore down Catholic monasteries and churches, draping the robes of the oppressive Catholic clergy over their own shoulders. Sacraments, the Eucharist, and icons lost their importance in Occitania. When the Cathar trumpet sounded in Lombardy, those long oppressed by the Catholic Church—whether they spoke Occitan, French, or the Lombard dialect of Italian—rose up, their fires of rebellion driving the main branch of the House of Savoy from their ancestral lands. Now, a cadet branch huddles in the small territory of Genoa. In the court of the Cathar stronghold, the Kingdom of Arles, Savoy and Piedmont are often collectively referred to as the 'Sister Republics.' Yet, despite this sisterly label, the two remain vastly different. Separated by the formidable barrier of the Alps, the Republic of Piedmont, unlike the Republic of Savoy, whose affairs are inextricably tied to Arles' control, can truly grasp its own destiny. Both republics claim Turin as their indisputable capital. The Republic of Savoy attempts to use the ducal claims of their former rulers as a tool for expansion, and the dispute over Turin's ownership has never been resolved between the two nations. It is only under the tight encirclement of Catholic powers, for the sake of defending the broader Cathar cause, that the two republics have refrained from open warfare. The new Consul's primary task is to resolve this historical issue. For Piedmont, the Duchy of Lombardy, straddling the richest lands of the Po Valley, is not only a major pillar of Catholicism in Northern Italy but also a staunch ally of the Emperor in the region. Piedmont, nestled at the foot of the Alps, cannot match Lombardy's wealth. Milan embodies all the glory and riches of Lombardy, and the threat from the east keeps the Consuls of Turin awake at night. Of course, if Milan were to be plunged into internal strife, it would not only eliminate the external threat from the east but could also present a prime opportunity for Piedmont to turn the tide in Northern Italy."

In Calvin's own writings, his attention to such matters is reluctant and minimal. While he did replace theological judgment with simple moral law as the basis for economic conduct, there is no reason to believe his doctrines made capitalist practices easier, and even less reason to think he intended them to. On the contrary, Calvinism advocated for curbing usury and the pawnshop economy, which to some extent harmed the interests of merchants.\n\nIf one identifies Calvin's followers by class and profession, two groups were more qualified than the merchants, at least in the early stages: the gentry and the artisans. In France and the Netherlands, as later in England and New England, Calvinist leadership was recruited from a class of socially influential yet poor and discontented minor gentry—the 'landed gentry' of the Cromwellian type.\n\nUndoubtedly, our doctrine has created tensions among our various social strata.

Amen.'\n\nIn Martin Luther's pen, each of the ninety-five theses strikes a powerful blow against the errors and abuses of the Papal Court. The critique of indulgences acted like a spark falling on a powder keg, instantly igniting a wildfire. Peasants and commoners saw Luther's anti-church theses as a signal for uprising, believing the time had come to settle accounts with all oppressors. Townspeople everywhere circulated the 'Ninety-five Theses.' The citizens of Strasbourg posted the theses on their church door. Humanists cheered enthusiastically. The artist Albrecht Dürer sent Luther a woodcut as a sign of appreciation. The nobility, and even some princes, hoped this would break the control of the Roman Church and allow the confiscation of ecclesiastical properties. For a time, the 'Ninety-five Theses' effectively became a common manifesto for national resistance. Originally written in Latin, the theses were translated into German, eagerly disseminated, spreading rapidly throughout Germany within two weeks and across the Christian world within a month."



EVTNAME2011:0 "Calvin and the Reformed Church"
EVTDESC2011:0 "The Protestant Reformation spread across Europe like wildfire. Several distinct reform movements had taken shape, each proposing its own way to reform the Christian faith. In $CAPITAL$, a preacher named John Calvin became the leading figure of the so-called school of Reformed theology. The Reformed religious communities adhering to John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion and its presbyterian polity are also known as 'Calvinists.' Calvinism emphasizes the total depravity of human ethical nature, asserting that only divine intervention can bring about human redemption, transforming individuals from rebellion to willing obedience. Mortals must believe that 'by the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestined unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death.'\n\nThey proclaim in their sermons: 'Those of mankind who are predestined unto life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His will, has chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory. This election is only of His free grace and love, without any foresight of faith, good works, or perseverance in either, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving Him thereunto; and all to the praise of His glorious grace. As for the rest of mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of His own will, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of His glorious justice.'\n\nCalvin's doctrine of 'predestination' had a broad and profound impact, adding fresh fuel to the fires of the Reformation movement."



EDG_flavor_religion_protestant.1.t:0 "Luther's Passing"
EDG_flavor_religion_protestant.1.d:0 "The pattern of Protestantism changed rapidly and grew increasingly complex, yet the pattern set by its originator, Luther, was simple and primal. The events within his soul influenced the entire Reformation movement, giving it a powerful impetus and direction. Unlike most, Luther grasped the historical significance of his own experiences. In his final letter, he wrote: 'Let us see what God wills to do.'\n\nThis phrase is a key to understanding his life. However, impressions of remoteness, isolation, and passivity can be misleading. In the realm of thought and ideas, there existed a vibrant, intense, and forceful movement. When Martin Bucer reproached the Wittenberg theologians for not paying sufficient attention to the commandment 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,' Luther's reply touched upon the whole truth: 'We are fulfilling this commandment with our pens.' From this small place, Luther launched immense intellectual weapons that outpaced his opponents, swiftly reaching every corner of Christendom, capturing the attention of everyone from peasants to emperors.\n\nPeople listened to his teachings and were moved by the Word. Between 1520 and 1560, 16,000 students attended lectures in Wittenberg. They represented the infectious power of preaching, a power that best explains why Luther's Reformation in Germany took such deep root, endured so long, and even spread to Northern Europe and the New World."

EDG_flavorSAX.0.desc:0 "Over the past few centuries, Saxony's influence within the Empire has continually faced challenges. Yet, on the ancient lands of Saxony, the House of Welf remains the undisputed northwestern pillar of the Empire. To counter external pressures from Lotharingia and Scandinavia, the Emperor was compelled to ally with the Duke of Saxony, and successive Welf rulers have been entrusted with the weighty office of Imperial Arch-Marshal. This is, to some extent, the result of mutual compromise between Saxony and the Emperor, for the Empire is gradually fragmenting. If Saxony were to turn its banners against the crown, the Emperor would not only lose the ample tax revenues of the Lower Rhine but also gain a formidable adversary. For the Welf family, serving as Imperial Arch-Marshals, times are not easy. To the west, the Flemings in the Low Countries are laboriously forging their fragile national identity, while Overijssel watches the Empire's fate like a vulture. To the north, the descendants of the Vikings, though they have forsaken their faith in Odin, still covet the Empire's territories. To the east, heretics shouting vengeance for Jan Hus stand entrenched in Moravia. At this moment, Saxony could, like its forebears, remain content as the northwestern bulwark of the Empire. But for the House of Welf, which has given birth to an Emperor, there clearly exists another path—to follow in the footsteps of the two great Henry Dukes: Henry the Fowler, founder of East Francia, and Henry the Lion, who narrowly missed greatness—to tread a path that truly represents North Germany."

The core doctrine of the Prayerists manifests a unique hedonistic philosophy. They assert that the Trinity is perceived through carnal desire, that God transforms Himself into matter to unite with the perfect spirit, and that God reveals His presence through different sensations. They believe human perfection is achieved solely through prayer, not sacraments—a doctrine some studies suggest may derive from the libertine ideas of certain early Gnostic schools. According to Michael Psellos's descriptions, the Prayerists engaged in revelries and, to some extent, acts that violated moral norms. Unquestionably, the Prayerists were deemed heretical by the Catholic Church and faced widespread persecution following the Imperial Diet, with many artisans and merchants adhering to this faith being expelled from their homelands.

The [Root.GetName] rulers, led by the House of Welf, have long held the office of Arch-Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire, guarding the Empire's northern frontiers. Under immense military pressure, [Root.GetName] established its first standing army. Over time, the militarism of [Root.GetName]—or what later generations termed [Root.GetName] militarism—reflected a defining characteristic or tradition of the state's development: pugnacity and martial prowess, deeply linked to the environment in which our nation found itself.\n\nFor a long time, the hard truth of military power has been thoroughly validated by practice. Consequently, a profound reverence for military strength has permeated all levels of [Root.GetName] society, leading to what historian Gerhard Schröder called the 'militarization of the middle class.' The [Root.GetName] middle class held military power in the highest esteem, evident not only in their respect for the army but also in their militaristic imitation of civilian organizations and activities. Teachers saw themselves as officers on a training ground; middle-aged merchants proudly displayed their reserve officer commissions. The militaristic tendencies of the middle class indicated that they regarded the military stratum as the highest echelon of society. This gave [Root.GetName]'s national development a distorted yet vigorous character, leading to its historical label as a 'police state,' where political life was entirely dominated by the army and military power, making the military the ultimate arbiter of German politics.\n\nAs the historian and writer Ludwig described it: 'For the witty Lüneburgers and other [Root.GetName]rs, the General Staff building became a kind of Apollonian temple; and the soldiers who moved in and out of this building, wearing trousers with broad red stripes, seemed to each bear a halo symbolizing the divine man.' There is no doubt that [Root.GetName] exhibited a high degree of national militarization, and this military fervor would bring us further benefits."

EDG_flavorSAX.101.t:0 "Quartermaster General Staff"
EDG_flavorSAX.101.desc:0 "With the introduction of technologies like gunpowder to Europe, new weapons began to replace traditional cold steel, sparking a revolution in Western military technology and thought. The scale of warfare expanded accordingly, and traditional organizational structures struggled to handle the increasingly complex tasks of command and logistics. In the early 16th century, the [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] oversaw the establishment of an institution known as the 'Quartermaster General Staff,' dedicated specifically to engineering and transportation affairs, and responsible for handling various 'technical auxiliary services,' including logistics, marches, encampments, and surveying. This institution is considered the precursor to the [Root.GetName] General Staff."
EDG_flavorSAX.101.a:0 "We certainly need the Quartermaster General Staff."
EDG_flavorSAX.101.b:0 "Well... it's not really necessary."

EDG_flavorSAX.102.t:0 "The Formidable Saxon Army"
EDG_flavorSAX.102.desc:0 "The army of [Root.GetName] is regarded as one of the finest in North Germany, a reputation stemming from the martial traditions of the Saxon region. This perception grants our troops greater confidence and enhanced combat effectiveness. Many ministers have proposed to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that more military resources be invested in military development, to make our army an even more formidable and undefeatable force."
EDG_flavorSAX.102.a:0 "We are indeed an undefeatable army!"
EDG_flavorSAX.102.b:0 "It's not that exaggerated."

EDG_flavorSAX.103.t:0 "[53.GetName] Military Tradition"
EDG_flavorSAX.103.desc:0 "The citizens of [53.GetName] have shown great enthusiasm for our military successes. On a certain day in $YEAR$, they organized a distinctive celebration for our army's recent victories and hope this date becomes an officially recognized holiday. Since Saxony became the northern bulwark of the Empire, the residents within [53.GetName] have consistently provided immense support, greatly encouraging the [Root.GetName] court."
EDG_flavorSAX.103.a:0 "Sponsor their military fervor!"
EDG_flavorSAX.103.b:0 "Let them just enlist."

EDG_flavorSAX.104.t:0 "The Arch-Marshal's Military Activities"
EDG_flavorSAX.104.desc:0 "We are the Imperial Arch-Marshal. Our recent military activities have attracted the attention of a large number of the Empire's traditional military nobility, who wish to join our army to seek glory, rank, and wealth."
EDG_flavorSAX.104.a:0 "Encourage them to enlist!"
EDG_flavorSAX.104.b:0 "They can handle other military duties."

EDG_flavorSAX.105.t:0 "[53.GetName] Market"
EDG_flavorSAX.105.desc:0 "Long ago, due to the substantial salt production in [53.GetName], it became the center of the salt trade in North Germany. However, with the decline of [53.GetName]'s commodity economy and the decay of the ancient salt routes, [53.GetName] gradually became a place merchants were reluctant to visit. Yet, thanks to our meticulous development of [53.GetName], it has once again become one of the most prosperous cities in North Germany, even rivaling Hamburg and Lübeck, leading to increasingly vibrant local economic activity."
EDG_flavorSAX.105.a:0 "This is a prime opportunity for investment!"
EDG_flavorSAX.105.b:0 "Let's collect taxes."

EDG_flavorSAX.106.t:0 "Hanoverian Horse"
EDG_flavorSAX.106.desc:0 "The Hanoverian horse is thoroughly German, originating from Lower Saxony in northern Germany. Its origins can be traced back to the war of 732 AD, a conflict between the Franks and the Saracens. From the 8th century onwards, this breed developed into the 'Great Horse' ridden by medieval knights, falling into the stocky, heavy Cob category, undoubtedly bred alongside the renowned Flanders horse. Some relevant practitioners wish to breed the Hanoverian horse further, aiming to develop an even superior equine breed."
EDG_flavorSAX.106.a:0 "We are eager to breed superior warhorses!"
EDG_flavorSAX.106.b:0 "We don't need cavalry."

EDG_flavorSAX.107.t:0 "Göttingen Cathedral"
EDG_flavorSAX.107.desc:0 "Before our integration, the ruler of Göttingen was the Bishop of Göttingen, supported by the House of Welf, and the Church held significant influence here. After we completed the integration of Göttingen, the local bishop proposed building a new cathedral in Göttingen to demonstrate our religious piety... Naturally, we will construct it according to our own religious principles."
EDG_flavorSAX.107.a:0 "We are the most devout believers."
EDG_flavorSAX.107.b:0 "We have no money."

EDG_flavorSAX.108.t:0 "Dessau Autonomy"
EDG_flavorSAX.108.desc:0 "One of the largest settlements in the County of Anhalt is Dessau. In the past, Dessau was governed by autonomous self-administration, with officials elected by the people and approved by the Duke. This form of governance was common in Anhalt, ensuring precise and convenient tax collection in many towns and villages, with no embezzlement of tax revenues."
EDG_flavorSAX.108.a:0 "We desire greater cooperation."
EDG_flavorSAX.108.b:0 "It is not necessary."

EDG_flavorSAX.109.t:0 "Frederick III"
EDG_flavorSAX.109.desc:0 "Frederick III, known as 'Frederick the Wise,' was renowned for his erudition and respect for scholars. In 1502, he founded the University of Wittenberg, attracting scholars like Staupitz and Martin Luther. He notably declined election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, fully embodying the demeanor of a wise ruler. When Martin Luther ignited the vigorous Reformation movement in 1517, he faced repeated persecution from the Pope and the Emperor. However, under the protection of Frederick III, Luther remained safe, allowing him to continue spreading his Protestant ideas under secure conditions, preserving a central figure for the European Reformation. Lutheranism later became the state religion of Saxony and several other German principalities. Considering the impact of this Reformation on the intellectual and cultural landscape of Europe and its role in leading Europe out of the Dark Ages, Frederick III, like Martin Luther, is a name frequently recalled by posterity. The Elector of Saxony was merely a prince within the German Confederation, not the sovereign of an independent state. 'The Wise' Frederick III is not listed among the primary monarchs, yet his influence on history surpasses that of many who are."
EDG_flavorSAX.109.a:0 "It is destiny!"
EDG_flavorSAX.109.b:0 "What did you say?"

EDG_flavorSAX.110.t:0 "Heinrich"
EDG_flavorSAX.110.desc:0 "Heinrich V is the current Count of Lauenburg. As a member of the House of Welf, he received an excellent military education from a young age and has provided valuable assistance to our military endeavors, achieving great feats in our efforts to defend the Empire and contend with the Emperor."
EDG_flavorSAX.110.a:0 "Appoint him to the Military Privy Council."
EDG_flavorSAX.110.b:0 "Place him in command of the army."

flavor_orl.4.d:0 "During the Four Kingdoms' War, Jeanne d'Arc consistently guarded the Victorious King, repelling attacks from the Lotharingians, English, and Arlesians until 1438, when the war ended with France's ultimate victory. Joan was thereafter called the 'Maid' by the French.\n\nTo retaliate against the French, the English bribed the Papacy to summon Joan for trial on the grounds that she 'claimed to hear voices from God'—a summons naturally ignored by all parties. Shamelessly, the English convicted Joan of heresy in absentia, tarnishing her reputation. However, through the diligent efforts of [Root.GetName], the Inquisition carefully reviewed the 1438 trial and, after numerous hearings, overturned all charges against her. Joan is now recognized as a devout Catholic, while the judges who tried her have been declared heretics."
