In the charred cellar of a monastery, the ashes of Visigothic manuscripts and Persian carpets are indistinguishable. A shepherd herding gaunt sheep through a pile of rubble suddenly kicks aside half a skull inlaid with blue glaze—seven centuries of wind and sand have failed to smooth away the petrified terror in its eye sockets.\n\nThe Tagus weeps through crumbling aqueducts, where thorns and Arabian fennel grow side by side in the riverbank's crevices. Deep within a collapsed watchtower, forgotten Andalusian strings still quiver in the Atlantic's tempest, echoing the funeral bells of distant Santiago de Compostela. All glory comes at the cost of countless lives; Iberia burns. The conclusion of the Reconquista brought not only the glory of the powerful, but also fields strewn with the wails of the bereaved.

By then, Lisbon had already become one of Rome's important strongholds in Iberia.\nIn the 5th century AD, the Suebi and later the Visigoths conquered the area. In 714 AD, Moors captured Lisbon, expanding the port further and enhancing its trade connections with both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.\nThereafter, Lisbon changed hands repeatedly between the rulers of Portucale and Badajoz, until it was firmly secured by Abdallah I, the Taifa of Badajoz. Since then, it gradually stabilized, becoming a crucial center of trade and navigation in western Iberia, where Muslims and Christians engaged in prosperous commercial activities.\nAfter the first pioneering fleet from Iberia sets sail, the Port of Lisbon, now a vital harbor of [Root.GetName], is about to enter its own era of glory."

The city was organized around a forum, the center of power and the intersection of its two main roads.\nIn the 8th century, the city fell into the clutches of the Saracens. In 1094, the valiant 'El Cid,' Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, captured the region around Valencia and briefly became its de facto ruler, until the Almoravid invasion returned it to Muslim control.\nSubsequently, the Kingdom of Aragon also ruled here, but not for long. Ultimately, the land where El Cid's spirit returned to Heaven fell into the hands of the Taifa of Murcia.\nAfter the Iberian Reconquista, under the governance of [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName], Valencia entered an era of economic and artistic prosperity.

Despite political turbulence, the city continued to rise. By the 15th century, the Port of Barcelona had become a crucial trade hub in the western Mediterranean, attracting a constant stream of merchants from Genoa, Naples, Arles, and Iberia, fostering increasingly prosperous commercial activities.\nAfter the unification of Iberia by [Root.GetName], Barcelona, with its advantageous geographical position, is destined to become a pivotal forward outpost for the Empire's projection of influence towards Italy, Occitania, and North Africa."

Under the growth of the Galician Republic, the Port of Marín has become a crucial maritime transportation hub for the region, engaging in frequent trade with other parts of Europe.\nWith the rise of Iberian maritime power following the completion of the Reconquista, the Port of Marín has encountered new opportunities for growth and is destined to become the window through which countless explorers venture to the New World."

After the 1st century AD, local shipyards were capable of constructing large grain carriers, transporting vast quantities of supplies to Rome from here.\nIn the 8th century AD, Saracens began their rule, constructing structures such as the Torre del Oro for port and city defense. Even during the most intense years of the Reconquista, the port remained prosperous, with goods shipped to all corners of Europe.\nBy the grace of the Lord, [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName] has now established the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) here.

The three gun decks of the Trinidad churn with infernal fire; the roar of its 64 heavy cannons freezes the North Sea waves into ice.

The banner of Saint Andrew's Cross rustles beyond Hadrian's Wall; Caesar's laurel wreath has been donned by Spain's Imperator.\n\nFrom the Rock of Gibraltar to the fertile soil of Mesopotamia, from the cold waves of the Rhine to the tides of the Nile, Iberian knights measure the world with their sword's edge. We are no longer conquerors confined to a peninsula, but the masters of Europa: the plains of France submit to Aragonese mail, the sandy seas of North Africa prostrate before the Asturian cross, and the waning crescent over Constantinople is replaced by Madrid's rising sun. Merchant ships laden with silks of the East and cloth of the Low Countries weave the Mediterranean's waves into the imperial purple robe.\n\nThe prayers of the Spanish Emperor penetrate the Vatican's dome, scattering Catholic hymns into former heretical churches. The minarets of Córdoba transform into church spires; the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem echoes with Latin Mass. The monarchs of Iberia are both warriors and saints: they take the Bible as their code of law, their warhorses as pens, writing the final chapter of the 'Reconquista' on the borders of the Eastern Empire. The flames of the Inquisition forge a sword that unifies faith and territory—from the Danube to the Euphrates, all peoples praise one Triune God and one supreme sovereign.\n\nUpon Rome's ruins, Spaniards plant the olive branch of the Renaissance. Scholars in Salamanca use Arabic numerals to chart the stars' courses; in the courtyards of Granada, Greek philosophy and Islamic law mingle by the fountains. In the imperial viceroyalties, documents signed in Latin, Greek, and Arabic let Athenian democracy and Persian centralism govern side by side—this is not merely a battlefield of conquerors' iron and gold, but a sanctuary where the wisdom of a universal empire crystallizes.\n\nWhen the Invincible Armada sails through the Bosporus, its sails already obscure the Aegean waves; from the harbor of Alexandria to the reefs of Britain, every inch of sea bears the imprint of Iberia's coat of arms. The silver of the Americas and the spices of the Ganges flow into the imperial treasury, but more brilliant than wealth is the rebirth of the name 'Rome' beneath the throne of Madrid—Spain knows no twilight, only glory that never sets.\n\nPerhaps future poets will sing thus: 'With sword and cross, they pieced the shattered Rome into an immortal map; their bloodline was molten gold, pouring forth the most magnificent imperial dream in human history.'"
