desc_EDG_BAH_exploison_1:0 "Superficially, the religious conflicts have ended, but the religious tensions stemming from the long-standing campaigns against the Hindu states of the Deccan have long been unmanageable. It only takes a spark to ignite the powder keg."

EDG_BAH_exploison_1_event.2:0 "Understood."

EDG_BAH_exploison_1_event.1.t:0 "Deccan Religious Strife"
EDG_BAH_exploison_1_event.1.d:0 "Severe religious strife has erupted in the Deccan. We must prepare to purge the rebels, appease the governors in various regions, and address the undercurrents of separatist forces in the southern territories we have conquered. Superficially, the religious conflicts have ended, but the religious tensions stemming from the long-standing campaigns against the Hindu states of the Deccan have long been unmanageable. It only takes a spark to ignite the powder keg.\n"Honorable Padishah, rumors of rebellion are spreading in the southern lands. The southern governors hope to dispatch troops for support, but this may be a premeditated revolt. Our great Padishah Ahmad swept across the entire Deccan with overwhelming force, breaking a century of division. However, the price of rapid expansion is the inability to quell the anger of various factions. Only our upper class is Shia, while the common people are predominantly Hindus with a small number of Buddhists. Their dissatisfaction with our rule has long been brewing. We should respect the customs of each sect, control the influential clergy of each faith, and even shape the great Padishah into a saint for each religion. This will allow us to better govern the peoples of all faiths.""
