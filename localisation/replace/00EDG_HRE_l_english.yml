EDG_flavorHRE.0.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Crowned Holy Roman Emperor"
EDG_flavorHRE.0.d:0 "[Root.EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt]"
EDG_flavorHRE.0.a:0 "We are now the Holy Roman Emperor!"
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_0:0 "Much like the great conflicts of history, the turbulent course of the Thirty Years' War was intertwined with the deliberate strategic balancing and intricate clashes of interest among the warring parties, making it difficult to simply define as a purely religious war. Each phase of the conflict sowed the seeds for future strife, leading contemporaries to call it a long battle that could never truly end. It was amidst this colossal conflict engulfing all of Europe that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was crowned Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nUndoubtedly, God has set immense difficulties before [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule over the Empire—perhaps, to put it another way, it is nearly impossible to govern the Empire successfully under such circumstances. The entire Holy Roman Empire has plunged into profound division. The teachings of Calvin and Martin Luther have created an irreparable rift with the Roman Catholic Church. Germans eagerly burn their fellow countrymen at the stake, slaughtering one another over minor doctrinal differences. This chaotic state will persist until the Empire's religious issues are fundamentally resolved.\n\nFor [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], resolving the Empire's religious conflicts is an immense challenge. Only the most resolute can accomplish this task—the religious strife will inevitably culminate in an outcome, whether it be the Emperor's triumph or the victory of the Protestants."
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_1:0 "No one will forget this magnificent morning. To the accompaniment of hymns, [Root.Monarch.GetName], King of the Romans, clad in a splendid robe embroidered with his family's coat of arms, slowly ascended the steps. Each footstep echoed through the vast cathedral, tightening the heartstrings of all present.\n\n"We beseech the Lord to hear our prayer for His chosen servant, [Root.Monarch.GetName]."\n\n"May the blessing of the Lord's dominion unite and sanctify him."\n\n"So we pray."\n\n"May the Lord guide the ascension to the Imperial throne."\n\n"To joyfully expand the borders of the Empire, we pray..."\n\n"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,"\n\n"I anoint thee with holy chrism as Emperor."\n\n"Amen."\n\nBright sunlight streamed through the stained glass, illuminating [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The congregation knelt slowly amid flickering candlelight as the Archbishop of Mainz received an exquisite golden sword from an attendant.\n\n"From the humble hands of the bishops, this sword is bestowed."\n\n"The spirits of the bishops are all consecrated by the seat of the Apostles."\n\n"From the humble hands of the bishops,"\n\n"This sacred Imperial crown is granted and placed upon thy head,"\n\n"In the name of Jesus Christ,"\n\n"He who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords,"\n\n"In the name of the Father and the Holy Spirit,"\n\n"To reign for all ages."\n\n"Amen."\n\nAs the hymns faded, all eyes turned to the new Emperor. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat solemnly upon the throne at the center of the cathedral, raising the golden sword high. Sunlight, candlelight, and the gaze of the people converged upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hand.\n\nUndoubtedly, a new age has dawned—an era for the Empire has arrived."
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_2:0 ""
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_3:0 ""
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_4:0 "Along the cathedral's long corridors, knights in brand-new full plate armor stood in rows on both sides of the path, the latest fashion in short swords at their waists. In the garden, the guard was divided into nine units, all clad in matching attire. Their master was none other than the emperor himself, high-spirited at this very moment. Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] wore a gilded sword at his side and a pair of well-cleaned old riding boots on his feet. The emperor's fervor for military life was no secret within the Empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was not only a new Caesar but also a great strategist. The troops under his command stood head and shoulders above the personal guards of the princes—a display of pride to the assembled nobles, and a warning to them as well. The emperor unfastened his scabbard and placed it beside the throne. With his right hand, he raised the sword high, pointing straight toward the entrance. The blade reflected the proud face of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s empire rested upon this sword—but would the sword truly answer to his will?"
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_5:0 "The Holy Roman Empire stands at a critical crossroads. Stumbling forward, the Empire has welcomed a new emperor, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Clad in the most noble and splendid robes, [Root.Monarch.GetName] strode majestically up the steps of the cathedral cloister. Attendants followed closely behind, reverently carrying vessels filled with items needed for the coronation ceremony. Representatives from across the German states had gathered here, led by the Archbishop of Mainz. Though they held little affection for Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName]—who lacked both talent and personal charisma—out of respect for Imperial tradition, they still assembled. Gathered in one place, their minds, however, remained fixated on the intricate rivalries among themselves. Before and after this day, the princes, the emperor, and the entire Empire continued along their own paths. The Empire welcomed yet another emperor, much like the sun rising as usual. This steady, cyclical succession is precisely the symbol of the Empire's endurance."
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_6:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is in a time of turmoil, yet the wheel of fate has placed a young emperor named [Root.Monarch.GetName] upon the throne. Though draped in splendid robes, this emperor lacks both talent and foresight. [Root.Monarch.GetName] shows little interest in political or military affairs, preferring to indulge in luxury and pleasure. On the day of the coronation, the cathedral cloister stood solemn and austere. Clad in resplendent golden robes, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the throne, facing representatives from the various states. Attendants held the vessels ready for the coronation. Yet the entire scene felt perfunctory and uninspired. The new sovereign displayed none of the majesty or authority befitting an emperor, merely going through the motions of the elaborate rituals. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacked vision for the Empire's future and took no reform measures to revitalize it. More time and resources were spent on frivolous pleasures than on the prosperity of the nation and its people. The assembled delegates watched in dismay, holding little affection for this emperor. Their hopes for the Empire were shattered by his inaction and indifference. Though the coronation symbolized the transfer of imperial authority, it could not conceal the disappointment and confusion this mediocre ruler brought to the realm. This chapter became one of regret in the history of the Holy Roman Empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign brought no progress or change to the Empire. On the contrary, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s incompetence and apathy only worsened the Empire's plight."
EDG_flavorHRE_0_1_desc_tt_7:0 "Under the flickering candlelight, Archbishop [MAI.Monarch.GetName] solemnly lifted the ancient Holy Roman Imperial Crown from its velvet cushion. The crown was so heavy—so heavy that the Archbishop struggled to bear its weight. It symbolized the brilliance and glory of the medieval Empire, and whoever wore it would shoulder the solemn duty of defending the Empire's borders and revitalizing Christendom.\n\nUnder the gaze of all present, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly ascended the high platform and knelt upon the silk-covered ground. The archbishops of the Empire sprinkled holy water upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] and offered prayers. Finally, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt before Archbishop [MAI.Monarch.GetName] and received the coronation."

#Regensburg Conference
incident_regensburg_conference:0 "Regensburg Conference"
incident_regensburg_conference_emperor_alert:0 "The Prayers Sect is a religious movement that emerged around 370 AD, mentioned by the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople. Its founder, a man named Peter who claimed to be Christ, was sentenced to stoning for blasphemy. Before his execution, he told his followers that three days later, he would ascend to heaven in the form of a wolf from his grave. The core doctrine of the Prayers Sect displays a distinct hedonistic philosophy. They believe that the Trinity is perceived through physical desires, that God transforms Himself into matter to unite with the perfect spirit, that God manifests His presence through different perceptions, and that human perfection is achieved solely through prayer rather than sacraments. The Prayers Sect persisted for centuries, maintaining contact with the Bogomils, the Bosnian Church, the Batar Movement, and the Cathars. Due to the spread of the Black Death, the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, and the ensuing upheaval in the Catholic world, the Prayers Sect—which shares many similarities with the Cathars—spread rapidly throughout the German territories. Many lower classes suffering under immense social pressure and upper classes indulging in hedonism were drawn to this sect that advocated for human liberation. Numerous German lords believed that tolerating the growth of the Prayers Sect could replenish their populations. Meanwhile, the Roman Curia and other bishops, grappling with the spread of the Cathars and Waldensians, set aside dealing with the Prayers Sect, which was less inclined to advocate overthrowing oppression or breaking away from Rome. Thus, the Prayers Sect developed extensively in secret with little hindrance. However, the crisis it brought would erupt in the mid-15th century. Large numbers of Christians within the Empire converted to this heretical doctrine, abandoning the virtues upheld by the Catholic Church, which triggered significant religious issues across the territories of Imperial princes. To address these problems, the Empire convened the Regensburg Conference, aiming to propose a feasible solution to the religious issues posed by the Prayers Sect."

On the contrary, his spirit seemed to be reborn in the minds of the Bohemians. With his death, the Hussite uprising did not subside due to the loss of its leader. Instead, all of Bohemia was swept up by Hus's lingering spirit. The achievements of the Council of Constance seemed instantly reduced to ashes by the fires of war in Bohemia. The radical Taborites and the moderate Utraquists were forced to set aside their differences in the face of Imperial suppression, step by step fanning the fury of the Bohemians to the very bedside of Emperor Sigismund. The Hussites wielded their wagon fort tactics with godlike skill in the Czech Basin. Before the Hussite war wagons, even armored knights appeared fragile and powerless. They defeated the crusades led by Emperor Sigismund multiple times. Following the ultimate failures of the 'Jerusalem Crusade' and the 'Albigensian Crusade,' the term 'crusade' had become a byword for futility among the common folk of Europe. Emperor Sigismund dared only hide within his family's scattered estates across the Empire. The reputation of the Roman Curia also suffered a severe blow, while the Lollards, Waldensians, and Prayers Sect grew ever more prominent. The Emperor dared not approach Prague, fearing capture by the mob. However, while the Emperor trembled before the formidable Hussites, internal divisions arose within the Hussite movement. The moderate Utraquists advocated reconciliation with the Emperor and the Catholic Church, while the radical Taborites demanded a completely independent national church and state free from Rome. The rift between the two factions became irreconcilable. The Utraquists chose to lay down their arms and defect to the Emperor, securing his army in exchange for a promise not to purge the Utraquists. The Taborites were driven out of Bohemia's fertile basin, yet the Emperor's forces never managed to penetrate the mountains of Moravia.

incident_Eliminate_Hussites_event.1.d:0 "Jan Hus died; his flesh was consumed by the flames of Prague. Yet his soul was not dragged to hell as the Pope had wished. On the contrary, his spirit seemed to be reborn in the minds of the Bohemians. With his death, the Hussite uprising did not subside due to the loss of its leader. Instead, all of Bohemia was swept up by Hus's lingering spirit. The achievements of the Council of Constance seemed instantly reduced to ashes by the fires of war in Bohemia. The radical Taborites and the moderate Utraquists were forced to set aside their differences in the face of Imperial suppression, step by step fanning the fury of the Bohemians to the very bedside of Emperor Sigismund. The Hussites wielded their wagon fort tactics with godlike skill in the Czech Basin. Before the Hussite war wagons, even armored knights appeared fragile and powerless. They defeated the crusades led by Emperor Sigismund multiple times. Following the ultimate failures of the 'Jerusalem Crusade' and the 'Albigensian Crusade,' the term 'crusade' had become a byword for futility among the common folk of Europe. Emperor Sigismund dared only hide within his family's scattered estates across the Empire. The reputation of the Roman Curia also suffered a severe blow, while the Lollards, Waldensians, and Prayers Sect grew ever more prominent. The Emperor dared not approach Prague, fearing capture by the mob. However, while the Emperor trembled before the formidable Hussites, internal divisions arose within the Hussite movement. The moderate Utraquists advocated reconciliation with the Emperor and the Catholic Church, while the radical Taborites demanded a completely independent national church and state free from Rome. The rift between the two factions became irreconcilable. The Utraquists chose to lay down their arms and defect to the Emperor, securing his army in exchange for a promise not to purge the Utraquists. The Taborites were driven out of Bohemia's fertile basin, yet the Emperor's forces never managed to penetrate the mountains of Moravia. In the Emperor's later years, the nightmare of the Hussites lingered before him. The Moravian archbishop was a Pope of the Hussites, gradually infiltrating Jan Hus's ideas into Sandomierz. Although the Utraquists within the Empire had quieted down, their inherent conflict with the Catholic Church was irreconcilable. More than once, the Pope condemned the Emperor for sheltering the Utraquists; in their eyes, any compromise with heretics was a desecration of Rome. In later times, Bohemia-Moravia-Sandomierz was vividly termed the 'Hussite Corridor'. Jan Hus's successors walked a path he had never been able to tread in his lifetime."

The broken walls and ruins of St. Vitus Cathedral cast a desolate hue over this plaza, while the nearby Prague Castle bears the scars of war. The heart of Bohemia beats with unease. Once occupied by Hussite mobs, the cathedral became their spoil. Although previous emperors repeatedly crushed these heretics, the followers of the heretical leader Jan Hus were like autumn weeds—no matter how one tried to root them out, they would sprout anew across the hills and fields with the coming of spring. They stood in solidarity with the heretics of Moravia, seemingly unconquerable in truth. But to Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName], this was merely a fallacy. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s troops swept through the villages of Bohemia and Moravia, arresting every heretical leader from each hamlet, offering them two choices: repent or face execution. For those Emperor deemed die-hard fanatics, only the methods of the Inquisition would suffice.\n\nSince the time of Emperor Sigismund, the Hussites had become a deeply entrenched tumor in the Kingdom of Bohemia, impossible to fully eradicate. The embers of the Hussite Wars could never be completely extinguished. Rulers within the Empire lacked the power to end the unceasing Hussite movement—only Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] achieved this. During his reign, the Empire successfully eliminated the Hussite presence within the Holy Roman Empire, definitively concluding the decades-long Hussite Wars."

#Peasants' War
great_peasant_war.1.d:0 "Peasants are rising up against their legal masters, demanding the abolition of serfdom and formal protection of peasant rights. This is not a local rebellion; seeds of discontent have spread throughout the Empire, often sown by dangerous heretics. All German princes must focus on their defenses and prepare for war against the very people they once ruled. This Peasants' War engulfed most of Germany, with roughly two-thirds of the peasantry joining the fight, making it an unprecedented rebellion in Western European history. It also differed from previous sporadic peasant anti-feudal disturbances or uprisings, such as the uprising led by the drummer Hans from Niklashausen in the Main region starting in 1476; the Bundschuh revolt in Heilbronn starting in 1493; and the Poor Conrad revolt in Swabia starting in 1513. This peasant revolt bears the characteristics of its era, becoming one of the primary driving forces behind the German Reformation and national movements. An agitator named Münzner traveled through the cities and countryside of Thuringia and Saxony, vigorously inciting peasants to resist their rulers. He established a secret organization, the 'Christian Union,' which became the core leadership preparing armed insurrection against feudal lords and urban nobility. He dispatched secret envoys in all directions, wrote numerous pamphlets, and coordinated scattered disturbances and uprisings across the land. Commoners and peasants from Thuringia, including crowds and miners from Luther's hometown, flocked to Allstedt like pilgrims to hear him preach. The princes attempted every means to halt Münzner's revolutionary activities—banning the printing of his works, forbidding commoners and peasants from listening to his sermons—yet the Peasants' War still spread like wildfire."
