EDG_BAH_missions_event.34.d:0 ""Fifty years of human life, like a dream, like an illusion..."\n\nAhmad lay on his bed, lamenting the hardships of life. His dreaming mind drifted back fifty years, when the master of Delhi with a million fierce troops loomed over the Deccan, the tiny Bahmanis could only endure humiliation, and this endurance lasted a full fifty years. Only when the old Sultan finally aged and the shackles binding the south began to loosen did the Bahmanis at last seize the crucial moment, winning their independent status—a victory that was delayed a full fifty years.\n\nNow, Delhi's cavalry sweeps down from the north in a great invasion. Seated upon gold and jade is that exceedingly aged old Sultan, his purpose to utterly extinguish the flames of Bahmani independence and freedom. The old Sultan spoke thus:\n\n"The Bahmanis once belonged to Delhi in the past; our two peoples are as close as flesh and blood, as brothers."\n\nEven as he spoke, he commanded his troops to slaughter these "brothers." City after city, the sabers of Delhi's horsemen cut down innocent men, women, and children like harvesting wheat.\n\nThe distant pain and screams startled the sleeping Ahmad awake. The dream was like a sharp knife, foretelling that "fated death." The merciful Allah had sent him a prophecy: when Ahmad is pierced in the heart by the Sword of Fate, an angel will stroke his face and accompany him on his final journey.\n\nBut before that, he will burn his remaining life, using his last moments to secure a future for the Bahmanis. Ahmad does not fear death, but he fears not having tried his utmost.\n\nAllah has promised him victory, provided he can forge the §MBahmanis§! into a §Tgreat empire§!.\nThat life-taking §R"Sword of Fate"§!...\n\nAhmad will die in thirty years.

EDG_BAH_missions_event.42.d:0 "Honorable Padishah, while the Bahmani State appears stable, prosperous, and thriving on the surface, beneath it, hidden undercurrents and open rivalries churn. Allow this old minister to explain in detail.\n 1. First, in 1450, the §BDisloyal Four-Province Governors§! event will trigger. We must complete the first Deccan disaster, the §BDeccan Religious Strife§!, to remove it.\n 2. Next is the §BDisloyalty of the Four Provincial Governors§! near Bidar. Although they have accompanied us for a long time, since §BBijapur§! and §BKadira§! successively declared independence... alas. The solution is that we can mitigate the debuff through the decision §GReward the Governor§!. Afterward, completing the mission §GUnify the Deccan States§! will refresh the mission tree and provide missions to resolve the governors' disloyalty. Completing the §GPacify the Four Governors§! mission will remove all buffs.\n 3. Our bureaucratic system is primarily Shia, while the common people are Hindu. They will become dissatisfied with our rule, potentially triggering the §Gmodifier§! §BIndian Religious Conflicts§!. The solution is to adopt the §GHumanist Ideas§! or achieve §G+9 Tolerance of Heretics§!. How to achieve §G+9 Tolerance§!? It's simple: completing missions to gain the Dhimmi estate can provide substantial tolerance. Surviving the §BDeccan Religious Strife§! disaster also grants significant tolerance and its cap. Later, completing the Northern Expedition missions (requires completing §GUnify the Deccan States§!) can provide substantial tolerance, potentially reaching exactly +9.\n 4. How to resolve the §Gmodifier§! §BIndian National Fragmentation§!? First, the starting ruler's 4/4/5 abilities ensure it absolutely will not trigger initially. Therefore, for a smooth transition, the player must reach §G1000 development§! §Gbefore 1475§!. If not reached by 1475, don't panic; develop peacefully. Overextension may cause minor rebellions, but it's manageable.\n 5. Next are matters concerning disasters. First, the §BDeccan Religious Strife§!. How to quickly overcome this disaster? We don't need to engage enemy armies directly, only siege their provinces. §BAnnex all Deccan tags completely (note: vassalization is not allowed)§!. If you can't swallow them all at once, you can break truces. Then wait for the event §GAbsolute Power§! to trigger, which will end the disaster.\n 6. How to overcome the disaster §GThe Collapse of the Deccan Empire§!? I designed this disaster as a trial to test the player's understanding of the combat system and application of military tactics. It requires setting up a fortress network near the capital for defense. What if I'm just bad, can't win, or am simply unskilled? Don't worry; after 5 years, all debuffs will disappear. The AI will also reduce its armies during this time, allowing you to handle things slowly later. Enemy strength is carefully calculated to avoid overwhelming advantages either way—me crushing you OR you crushing me. The main goal is to make players sweat while experiencing the thrill of battle, and to think strategically about troop movement.\n 7. For other questions or bugs, please contact §GEDG Bahmanis Author - Guan Muhua§!. Thank you for playing. Wishing you a pleasant life and success in all endeavors! May you enjoy every moment, and stay healthy!"
