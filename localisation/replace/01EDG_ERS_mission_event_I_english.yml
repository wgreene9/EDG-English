Please note that choosing a more brutal suppression will result in fiercer Islamic rebellions within the event, but correspondingly, the 'Islamic Revenge' disaster itself will be easier to overcome. The opposite is also true."

mission_EDGERSmission.9.txt:0 "Just as Ardashir, the founder of the Sassanid Persia, led the oppressed and suffering people in revolt and ultimately overthrew the Parthian dynasty, we, together with the Muzaffarids, have now triumphed over the evil Muslims, driven them from the Iranian Plateau, and allowed ourselves to return to the embrace of Zoroastrianism. However, this is but a temporary peace. The expelled followers of Islam still covet this land. Yet, as described in Zoroastrian doctrine, good will ultimately triumph over evil, and all Daevas will be vanquished. Though we of this time cannot witness that moment with our own eyes, at least for now, we are once again bathed in the radiance of Ahura Mazda."

ers_new_idea_1_desc:0 "During the Sassanian era, the Academy of Gundeshapur was one of our greatest centers of learning, remaining so until the establishment of the House of Wisdom following the Islamic conquest. Upon reviving Sassanid Persia, it is our duty to rebuild this great academy... No, not merely rebuild. We must learn from the House of Wisdom's greater success, understand how it supplanted the original status of the Gundeshapur Academy, and reform our academic exchange practices accordingly. This will solidify the position of the Gundeshapur Academy, transforming it into the world's academic center."

ers_new_idea_2_desc:0 "The governance of any empire is inseparable from a sound bureaucratic system. We ought to entrust the governance of the state to the Grand Vizier rather than the clergy. However, to prevent a recurrence of the situation where bureaucratic power surpasses that of the Shahanshah (King of Kings), we should re-establish the position of the Grand Frahmadar (Vuzurg Framadar) from the Sassanian era. By creating a system of checks and balances between the Grand Frahmadar and the Grand Vizier, we will ensure more stable governance for our empire."

ers_new_idea_3_desc:0 "Whether before or after the conquest, we have always been a nation passionate about constructing grand edifices. Our people's achievements in architecture are countless; even the Arabs who conquered us were ultimately influenced by our architectural styles. Yet we must remember well that our architecture originates not only from ourselves but also from learning from and inheriting the traditions of Greece and Mesopotamia. We must continue to advance and glorify Persian architecture."

ers_new_idea_4_desc:0 "Firearms are like invisible reapers on the battlefield, harvesting the lives of soldiers wave after wave. As the era progresses, gunpowder from the East is fashioned into countless firearms increasingly deployed in warfare. Forming more well-trained firearm armies will be the key to victory on future battlefields."

ers_new_idea_5_desc:0 "From the time Cyrus the Great founded the Persian Empire, we have always controlled the flow of overland trade. Silk and spices from the East; glassware and wine from the West—the exchange of trade goods has always passed through our hands. As long as we firmly hold this commercial hub, the economic value it brings us will be immeasurable."

ers_new_idea_6_desc:0 "Daevas, also known as Devi, are evil deities opposed to the benevolent Ahura Mazda. They harm our faithful, prevent the arrival of goodness, and bring all calamities to the world. Mazda, Mazda, the deity we worship, leads us to triumph over the evil Daevas and dispel disasters. Let us serve as the vanguard, fighting against all evil until the end of days."

mission_EDGERSmission.1000.txt:0 ""Here lies the Ancestor, the Returner who led the people's uprising," reads a stone tablet at a tourist site in Amol, Tabaristan. /n "Here lie the fallen warriors, for whom the Empire shed tears of blood," is written in the historical introductions of Shiraz, Tabriz, Yazd, Isfahan, and Ctesiphon—all five cities. /n "Here lie the countless common folk who gave their all for the Purification; their descendants now enjoy the sweetness born from their suffering," is how every citizen of the Empire teaches their offspring. /n "Here lie they, our respected foes, who contended with us for centuries and once even laid siege to our capital," is inscribed upon the Theodosian Walls in Konstantiniyye. /n ....../n "I had a dream. In this dream, the world truly became as described in our doctrine. Through our actions, the end of the world arrived, all sins were cleansed, and every departed soul was resurrected." /n Sitting in his study, [Root.Monarch.GetName] murmured to himself, "Ah, but it was only a dream. The departed will not return. Yet, at least..." [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed out the window at the bustling streets, where the people of the Empire came and went, merchants calculated trades with their abacuses, and children chased each other with innocent laughter. "Flowers in full bloom will eventually wither. Witnessed and recorded by our own eyes, this glorious age once graced the world. And it shall be witnessed by the eyes of our descendants—the next golden age." /n This is the story of Mazandaran in this world—a tale of a small nation on the brink of extinction rising from the ashes, battling the Uzbeks, maneuvering around the Safavid Order, taking revenge upon Islam, concluding its grudges with age-old enemies, and achieving a singular human epic."
