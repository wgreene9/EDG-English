EDG_yard_landlord_system_modifier:0 "Expansion of the Odnodvortsy Landlord Group"
EDG_yard_landlord_system_modifier_desc:0 "Rus' landowners and lords are required to provide troops to the state, but providing soldiers means a reduction in the serfs owned by the landlords. Hence, landlords often only supply rogues and ruffians as soldiers, whose combat effectiveness is very low. The Odnodvortsy are a special class in the Rus' region, essentially acting as feudal agents for noble landlords, handling the daily management affairs for their superiors—this is their economic role. Militarily, Odnodvortsy who join the army possess higher quality and are soldiers with strong combat capabilities. We can rely on them to become the core force of the army."
EDG_ruthenian_provincial_system_modifier:0 "Refinement of the Ruthenian Feudal System"
EDG_ruthenian_provincial_system_modifier_desc:0 "The rulers of the Ruthenian region have long adhered to the ancient feudal system, an old order constructed by liege lords and powerful vassals, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Kyivan Rus' Civil War. After the civil war, no one wishes to repeat the Grand Prince of Kyiv's fate. Therefore, we must prevent the emergence of powerful magnates within the country."

EDG_ruthenian_adm_tech_6_Economic_reform_modifier_desc:0 "In 1470, a Ruthenian named Vladimir Ivanovich Ivanov traveled throughout Kyivan Rus'. He was erudite yet held peculiar views, proposing a set of ideas for economic reform, with a key component being the construction of workshops. It is said that in his early years, he posted recruitment notices for workshops in Kyiv's main square, declaring that working in a workshop was a promising future occupation. He also requested local municipal officials to grant certain privileges to local handicrafts. This man seemed to be speaking nonsense, but our ruler showed considerable interest."

However, improvements in modern drainage systems have promoted the development of wetlands. We can drain the marshes to obtain more arable land, thereby supporting a larger population."
EDG_ruthenian_mil_tech_9_reform_modifier:0 "Expansion of the Odnodvortsy Officer Corps"
EDG_ruthenian_mil_tech_9_reform_modifier_desc:0 "On the battlefield, training and combat experience have always held significant value. With the arrival of gunpowder and tactical changes brought by other infantry weapons, there is a great demand for troops proficient in using new weaponry. When professional armies cannot meet this demand, it is addressed by recruiting mercenaries from places like Italy, Switzerland, or the Germanies. An increasing number of professional mercenary officers provided substantial personnel support to nations undergoing military transformation. The Rus' region is no exception; facing long-term war threats, the need for professional officers has always been urgent. Prioritizing the training and recruitment of professional officers on the national agenda can greatly enhance the army's combat effectiveness."

EDG_TUR_decline_after_modifier_desc:0 "Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the Turks' empire continued to decline, sinking into prolonged stagnation—even described by historians as entering an era of failure. During this period, Turkish technology remained backward for an extended time; the empire fell into the quagmire of corruption and rigid class stratification; local power continuously expanded, and domestic contradictions grew increasingly acute. Today, the empire's internal contradictions have fully surfaced. The façade of Ottoman imperial strength has been torn apart; all domestic classes and foreign powers have realized the fact of the empire's decline. This has caused even greater negative impacts: the army has completely recognized the incompetence of the state and its officers; local governors confidently choose to ignore central commands. Unless effective reforms are carried out, the empire's decline will be irreversible following the eruption of domestic conflicts."

By marrying the daughter of the Bulgarian king, Dušan established good neighborly relations with the Bulgarian Kingdom and took advantage of the internal turmoil in the Byzantine Empire to wage war against it. He successively occupied most of Byzantine-held Macedonia, nearly all of Albania, and vast territories in central and northern Greece. Dušan dreamed of establishing a powerful Serbian Empire and proclaimed himself emperor in 1345. Subsequently, he was crowned by the Orthodox Church as 'Emperor of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Albanians,' initially with the capital at Prizren in Kosovo, later moving it to Skopje. The empire persisted until 1443, when Bulgaria and Albania rebelled against Serbian imperial rule, causing the feudal system of the Serbian Empire to collapse. The Serbian Empire is now history; we have thoroughly ended the foolish aspirations of the Serbs, consigning this incongruous empire to its grave."

In the early 7th century, after the rise of Islam, the various Arab tribes rapidly expanded outward after unifying under the banner of Islam. By the mid-8th century, they established the Arab Empire stretching from the Indus River in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, spanning Asia, Africa, and Europe. From the 10th century onward, Arab power gradually declined and fragmented into many independent caliphates. In 1055, the Seljuk Turks captured Baghdad, ending the Eastern Caliphate. The western caliphates subsequently fell one after another. However, the title of Caliph persisted until 1258. Throughout their fluctuations, Arab states remained fragmented.

EDG_flavorMHM_3_modifier:0 "Urban's Artillery Corps"
EDG_flavorMHM_3_modifier_desc:0 "Urban was a metallurgy expert skilled in cannon-making. Initially, he intended to serve the Byzantine Emperor, but the emperor could neither afford his wages nor provide the necessary materials. Therefore, he turned to the Sultan, claiming that the cannons he built could not only destroy the walls of Byzantium but were also a match for the legendary walls of Babylon. Mehmed was always interested in new advances in military science, eager to equip his army with the most advanced weaponry. He also enjoyed studying the construction techniques of modern fortifications and siege engines, summoning foreign weapons experts to the palace to answer his questions. Thus, Mehmed immediately hired Urban at a high price and ordered him to forge a cannon for the Rumelihisari fortress, powerful enough to blockade the Bosporus Strait, to test his capabilities. It took him three months to cast the cannon. One day, a Venetian ship carrying grain was passing through the strait en route to Constantinople. The ship failed to heed the command to stop and was directly hit by a cannonball, sinking immediately. The cannon's test was a great success. Subsequently, Mehmed ordered Urban to cast a cannon twice the size at a foundry in Edirne. Upon completion, Mehmed assigned 700 men to guard and transport it. They required 15 pairs of oxen to barely move this behemoth. This enormous cannon, over 7 meters long with a 76 cm caliber, could fire a 544-kilogram projectile. The cannon was placed near the Sultan's new palace for a test firing. Before the test, nearby residents were warned not to be alarmed by the sound. The fuse was lit, the cannon fired, and the massive explosion could be heard over ten kilometers away. The cannonball traveled 1.6 kilometers, landing and creating a crater 2 meters deep. The Sultan, pleased with the test's success, ordered roads to be leveled and bridges strengthened so that by spring, the cannon could be transported outside the walls of Constantinople. Meanwhile, smaller cannons were also being produced in the Sultan's foundries. Thus, he created an artillery force using gunpowder unprecedented in the East—a force that had already existed in the West for a century. Against these cannons, Constantinople's stone walls from the Middle Ages and even earlier were no longer effective defenses."

EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_1_18_modifier_desc:0 "In Egypt, the religious policies of Muslim rulers were also reflected in their attitude toward the conversion of Copts to Islam. They continued the 'Dhimmi' system consistently implemented in other conquered regions. In Islamic states, tolerated and protected Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians were all referred to as 'Dhimmis,' meaning 'People of the Covenant.' These non-Muslims had to acknowledge the supremacy of Islam and the dominant position of the Islamic state, accepting a subordinate status through certain social restrictions and paying a poll tax (jizya) not required of Muslims. In return, they enjoyed security of life and property, protection against external enemies, freedom of worship, and considerable autonomy in handling their own affairs."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_1_19_modifier_desc:0 "The early Persian Empire relied on undisciplined Turkmen nomadic tribal armies, which frequently rebelled. For contemporary Persian rulers, how to curb the expansion of Qizilbash power was the primary issue upon ascension. With the help of the English adventurer Robert Shirley and under the direction of minister Allahverdi Khan, we utilized new weaponry to equip a new army, making it the cornerstone for curbing tribal power. The new standing army consisted of the Royal Corps, formed from Persian peasants and prisoners of war and their descendants from Caucasian regions such as Armenians, Georgians, and Circassians. It mainly included artillery, musketeers, and infantry. Among them, each infantry corps numbered 12,000, each cavalry corps 10,000, all equipped with muskets; the artillery numbered 12,000, equipped with 500 bronze cannons."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_1_20_modifier_desc:0 "In addition to establishing new regular troops, Abbas also expanded the size of the Royal Guard to 3,000 men. The duties of the Guard were to protect the Emperor and royal family members and to be ready for the Emperor's dispatch at any time. The military reforms not only enhanced the combat effectiveness of the forces, enabling them to better defend the state regime and resist external aggression, but also reduced the number of Qizilbash in the army from the original 60,000-80,000 to 30,000. This reversed the situation where Turkmen tribal nobles maintained their own military power and diminished the influence of the Qizilbash within the army."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_2_15_modifier_desc:0 "The Persians have a long tradition of bureaucratic systems. The local Persian bureaucracy is the pillar of our state governance. Establishing an administrative system in line with Persian traditions will enhance our state governance capacity."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_2_17_modifier_desc:0 "The Diwan system originated from the Persian Emperor Khosrow I. In Persian, it initially meant 'mad fool' and later referred to financial personnel. Under the Diwan system, the financial officials of the Diwan held relatively high status but were typically not nobles. They not only conducted financial audits but also had supervisory functions to check the power of nobles and powerful ministers."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_2_19_modifier_desc:0 "Beneath the Shah was the Supreme Council, convened by the Shah and composed of military nobles from various nomadic tribes, bureaucrats, and representatives of the Ulema appointed by the Shah. The official next in rank to the Shah was the 'Grand Vizier,' who served as the Shah's agent. The Grand Vizier was usually held by a Persian noble, wielding immense power and controlling national affairs. Next was the 'Amir al-Umara,' the Commander-in-Chief of the army; followed by the 'Sadr al-Sudur,' the upholder of the Shah's decrees and a legal advisor on Muslim law. Additionally, there were ministers in charge of finance and other ministries. The council of ministers only had advisory power; the final decision rested with the Shah. However, the Grand Vizier had always been the highest leader of the cabinet. We need to make some changes to weaken the Grand Vizier's power and strengthen royal authority."

This was a professional elite force. Historical Turco-Persian empires such as the Samanid, Ghaznavid, Kara-Khanid, Seljuk, Ghurid, and Khwarezmian dynasties all established Ghulam units. During the 13th-15th centuries AD, due to events like the Mongol invasions, Persia and the entire eastern Islamic world fell into chaos, and the Ghulam system gradually declined. In the 16th century AD, Persia regained its statehood. To balance the increasingly powerful Qizilbash forces within the country, a new Ghulam system known as 'Shahsevans' ('Friends of the King') was established. However, the new Ghulams differed significantly from the previous ones."

Particularly, the British and Dutch highly valued Iranian carpets, silk, and textiles. Other exports included horses, wool, pearls, and almonds used as spices in India. Major imports consisted of coinage, textiles, spices, metals, coffee, and sugar."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_5_16_modifier_desc:0 "The state's fiscal power has long been controlled by the great nobles domestically, greatly constraining our national financial system.

He reorganized taxation nationwide, codified the tax system, and taxes were directly levied almost everywhere based on laws promulgated by the central government. At that time, the total national tax revenue amounted to approximately 785,623 tumans, while government expenditures totaled 491,796 tumans. Consequently, there was a significant budget surplus. This surplus was stored in the state treasury for the king's use when needed. By redistributing fiscal revenue among different strata, the government further strengthened its control over the administrative apparatus. To alleviate the economic burden on the poor, Abbas also ordered the exemption of certain taxes."
EDG_Persia_empire_Mission_5_18_modifier_desc:0 "During the reign of Abbas I, Persian handicrafts also experienced unprecedented development. Abbas extensively established factories and schools, widely attracting talent. According to statistics, the carpet factories in Isfahan were very large-scale, employing as many as 25,000 workers alone. In addition to hiring domestic workers, he also extensively introduced foreign expertise, such as inviting 300 Chinese artisans skilled in porcelain-making, who settled in Isfahan and other places along with their families. Abbas's economic policies led to the emergence of capitalist sprouts in the Safavid dynasty, bringing about prosperity unseen since the Mongol invasions."

As a thriving salt-producing area, Lüneburg became the starting point of the famous German 'Salt Road.' Salt was transported from here to Lübeck and then shipped to Nordic countries. 'White gold' brought immense wealth and medieval prosperity to this city."
