EDG_HSA_hanseatic_league:0 "Hanseatic League"
EDG_HSA_hanseatic_league_desc:0 "A commercial alliance formed by coastal cities in northern Germany to protect their trade interests. The Germanic word 'Hansa', from which the name derives, originally meant 'group' or 'guild'. The league was formed in 1356 and at its peak included over 160 member cities, with its center in Lübeck. From the 12th century, North German merchants organized the 'Cologne Hansa' and 'Hamburg Hansa' for trade with England and Flanders. From roughly the mid-12th to mid-13th century, trade along the Rhine was active, and the focus of foreign trade gradually expanded to the Baltic region. In the 1280s, various merchant organizations in the Rhineland cooperated to safeguard common interests, allying with Lübeck and other North German cities controlling Baltic trade to defend against bandits and pirates and ensure trade security. The name 'Hanseatic League' first appeared in 1344, initially as a commercial league sharing privileges. In 1356, the merchant Hansa developed into a city Hansa, joined by most North German coastal cities, with Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen at its core; later additions included Cologne, Danzig, and Königsberg. In 1358, cities on the eastern Baltic coast like Riga also joined. The league monopolized intermediary trade between Eastern/Northern Europe and Western Europe. Its merchants also handled Eastern goods like spices and expensive textiles through Italian merchants. In 1367, representatives from 77 member cities held their first meeting in Cologne. The league had a supreme council and supreme court; member cities had to obey the decisions of its governing bodies. They shared public finances and a navy and had the authority to conduct foreign diplomacy, declare war, make peace, and sign treaties. From 1368 to 1370, the combined fleet of the Hanseatic League defeated Denmark, forcing it to sign the Treaty of Stralsund. This treaty gave the league a political character in Northern Europe, expanding its control over Baltic and North Sea trade and over Scandinavian politics. The Hanseatic League entered its golden age, with allied cities numbering over 160. The league enjoyed commercial privileges in various places, establishing Kontors (trading posts) in London, Novgorod, Bruges, Bergen, and elsewhere. The governments of the league's cities were controlled by urban patricians and wealthy merchants."
