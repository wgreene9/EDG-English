EDG_LOT_ADM_ideas_1_desc:0 "The administrative reform of establishing the Treasury aims to strengthen central financial management. This institution is responsible for uniformly managing state revenue, ensuring rational allocation and use of taxes, thereby enhancing fiscal transparency and efficiency. This reform not only consolidates royal control over economic resources but also lays the foundation for subsequent administrative reforms."
EDG_LOT_ADM_ideas_2_desc:0 "The core of this reform is the appointment of Privy Councilors to improve governance efficiency and strengthen royal control over local affairs. Through establishing the Privy Council, the King consolidates power while appointing loyal officials to manage regional matters, effectively addressing internal and external threats to stabilize and unify the kingdom."
EDG_LOT_ADM_ideas_3_desc:0 "The original 'King's Agents' and 'King's Lawyers' gradually evolved into dedicated state prosecutors responsible for investigating, prosecuting, and supervising local judicial affairs. By establishing a unified procuratorial system, the Kingdom not only enhanced prosecution efficiency for criminal offenses but also strengthened oversight of local administration, thereby consolidating royal control over various duchies. This reform marks a significant step toward modernization in Lotharingia's judicial system."
EDG_LOT_ADM_ideas_4_desc:0 "All local administrators and nobles must publicly swear allegiance to the King to ensure unified local authority and consolidated royal power. This measure aims to eliminate regional autonomy and strengthen the King's control over the nation."

The lifestyle and artistic styles of the Lotharingian court profoundly influenced other European regions, particularly in architecture and painting."
EDG_LOT_DIP_ideas_2_desc:0 "The 15th century marked an era of European Renaissance and Age of Discovery, witnessing increasingly frequent diplomatic activities among European nations. As Protestant missionaries, diplomats, merchants, and travelers replaced Jesuits as primary transmitters of China's image in the West, European perceptions of China gradually evolved. During this period, diplomats' roles became more crucial, encompassing not only international relations but also cultural exchange, intelligence gathering, and political propaganda. Therefore, the Kingdom of Lotharingia established the Diplomatic Academy to cultivate diplomatic talents with multilingual capabilities, diplomatic skills, and cultural understanding to adapt to the increasingly complex international environment."

EDG_LOT_MIL_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Frankish military nobility formed a vital component of early medieval Western European feudalism, playing key roles in the Frankish Kingdom's establishment, expansion, and feudalization processes. As heirs to the Franks, our domestic nobility largely adheres to ancient Frankish traditions."
EDG_LOT_MIL_ideas_3_desc:0 "The feudal levy system, which tied military obligations to feudal status and was typically managed by nobles or lords for conscription and training, not only restricted commoners' military participation but also hindered national unification and modernization.
