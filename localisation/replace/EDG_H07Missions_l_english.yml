EDG_H07_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The people of Weimar have no maritime tradition, but once we engage in sea trade, naval development naturally becomes an essential task."

EDG_H07_mission_1_4_title:0 "Consolidating Authority"
EDG_H07_mission_1_4_desc:0 "After initial stabilization, new problems arise. Though we have overthrown the former oligarchs, their lingering influence remains hostile to our regime. Now the new Republic is weak; we must unite all available forces within the country."

EDG_H07_mission_1_5_title:0 "The Road to Olarmund"
EDG_H07_mission_1_5_desc:0 "Gold is not everything, but in Weimar, it might as well be. We need gold; we always have. The Olarmund trade route must be reopened. Only then can we secure sufficient funds to support the republican cause."
EDG_H07_mission_1_5.tt:0 "§YThe Free City of Coburg is our biggest competitor in western trade. However, money talks. Perhaps we can use gold to strike a... surprising deal with Coburg's merchants.§!\n"

EDG_H07_mission_1_7_title:0 "Hessian Matters"
EDG_H07_mission_1_7_desc:0 "Hesse, also known as Hessonia. But whether it's Hessen, Hassia, or Hessia, how would illiterate old peasants understand the lords' careful naming? Just as the duke in his castle could never understand how much these lowly folk sacrifice to survive. When they debate succession rights in court, who cares about the children without shoes?"
EDG_H07_mission_1_7.tt:0 "§YThe Hesse region connects Westphalia in the north with the Rhineland in the west, and is one of the wealthiest areas in northwestern Germany. If we can establish a foothold here, we can pry open the local market, providing more financial support for the Republic's cause.§!\n"

EDG_H07_mission_1_9_desc:0 "The Upper IJssel and the Low Country merchants never imagined what would happen if peasants with pitchforks came to their doorsteps. They wouldn't, because one cannot imagine something impossible—yet we accomplished the impossible. Westphalia lies ahead. March!"

EDG_H07_mission_1_12_desc:0 "The clergy of Würzburg have always been at the forefront of criticizing freemen. In their eyes, if serfs gain freedom, they will only become lazy gluttons. In that case, let us show these clergymen who the true lazy scoundrels are."
EDG_H07_mission_1_12.tt:0 "§YThe corruption of the Würzburg Chapter is a microcosm of domestic religious education. If we cannot handle this properly, dogmatism will trip us up.§!\n"

EDG_H07_mission_1_13_title:0 "Palatine Arrogance" # The Arrogance of the Palatine Elector
EDG_H07_mission_1_13_desc:0 "The Electoral Palatinate, the Emperor's staunch supporter, the Empire's glorious palace, its influence pervading all of Southern Germany. They are arrogant, they are foolish, they issue orders to others at will, draped in their fur coats. We are not bandits, but the peasants won't mind taking what is rightfully theirs from the palace."

EDG_H07_mission_2_3_desc:0 "The situation for the nascent Second Weimar Republic is not optimistic. After expelling the oligarchs and plutocrats, we must maintain social stability while ensuring we do not become the next dictators. With the nation leaderless, we must restore order as soon as possible."

EDG_H07_mission_2_4_title:0 "Restoring Production"
EDG_H07_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Years of rebellion have utterly destroyed Weimar's already fragile agricultural production; we can barely supply the sacramental bread for church services. For freedom, and for mothers and children, production must be restored to get the economy flowing!"

EDG_H07_mission_2_6_title:0 "The Western Front"
EDG_H07_mission_2_6_desc:0 "To the west and south of Weimar lie free cities and German bishoprics, a land of princes where even minor movements draw unnecessary attention. Fortunately, in the eyes of the nobility, we are just an illiterate rabble. Thus, they pay no mind to Weimar's western expansion—after all, what trouble can a bunch of old peasants cause, right?"

EDG_H07_mission_2_7_title:0 "The Tide of Freedom"
EDG_H07_mission_2_7_desc:0 "The Rhine River flows northward, carrying the people's hopes for freedom into the distance. Following the Rhine downstream, the value of freedom will illuminate the German lands. Any noble or tyrant attempting to block us will tremble before Christ's holy light and the people's wrath."
EDG_H07_mission_2_7.tt:0 "§YGöttingen is key to entering northwestern Germany, namely Brunswick. In the coming campaign, securing Göttingen's defenses will be crucial to the war effort.§!"

EDG_H07_mission_2_11_desc:0 "Ah, Franconia, Franken, my dear southern land. Beyond Coburg lies the original homeland of the Franks. How glorious the Frankish Empire once was, yet it forgot the Franks who built it. When Frankish lands were carved up among princes, peasants were merely treaty addendums."
EDG_H07_mission_2_11.tt:0 "As we gradually liberate the German states, we have finally drawn the Emperor's attention. However, perhaps due to concerns about outright war, the Emperor does not plan direct sanctions but instead seeks to limit us through a Papally-mediated arbitration.\n\n§ROur subsequent choices during the arbitration proceedings will directly determine our future fate§!"

EDG_H07_mission_2_12_title:0 "The Bishop of Bamberg"
EDG_H07_mission_2_12_desc:0 "Bamberg Cathedral was burned down twice and rebuilt twice, but the faithful who dedicated themselves to its glory were forgotten, while the idle Catholic clergy achieved immortality. They tarnished God's name and defiled Bamberg's churches."
EDG_H07_mission_2_12.tt:0 "§YThe Bishopric of Bamberg was once the most stubborn stronghold of religious conservatism in Southern Germany. Local resistance and corruption best reflect the escalating conflict between northern and southern clergy within the country. This time, we will solve this problem once and for all!§!\n"

EDG_H07_mission_2_13_title:0 "In Bavaria"
EDG_H07_mission_2_13_desc:0 "As one of the core regions of Southern Germany, the divided Bavarians have a culture distinct from both the north and the south. They prefer beer and sausages over bread and wine, but they are still Germans, still our compatriots!"

EDG_H07_mission_2_14_title:0 "Compromise and Persistence"
EDG_H07_mission_2_14_desc:0 "The path to German unification is long. The Holy Roman Empire recorded in history books was never a unified nation, and a German fatherland never truly emerged. Liberating people from the old order, the flag of the German people shall replace the double-headed eagle and the golden griffin."

The tragedy of Mühlhausen will not frighten us. On the contrary, the more they oppress us, the stronger this anger grows."

EDG_H07_mission_3_5_title:0 "Fighting the Eagle"
EDG_H07_mission_3_5_desc:0 "Though we are weak and cannot compare to those feudal princes, whatever God commands, the people of Weimar will do; whatever God desires, the people of Weimar will obey.

Now, all our routes in Southern Germany are blocked by the Emperor, with no other solutions in sight. Fighting His Majesty at this stage would still be overreaching, so... I fear we must make a deal with the devil."
