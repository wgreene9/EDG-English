string_start_title_genoa:0 "§YRepublic of Genoa§!"
string_start_genoa:0 "§YHistory§!\n\nThe §YRepublic of Genoa§! first gained independence from the Kingdom of Italy in 1005 and seized its initial opportunity.\n\nDuring the years 934-935, §YGenoa§! was thoroughly sacked by Muslims from North Africa. That same year, they began building ships to protect the coast, fortifying walls and constructing castles. Between 950 and 1100, §YGenoa§! developed its military strength, shifting from defense against Muslims to offense. Most notably, in 1016, with the support of Pope §YBenedict VIII§!, they allied with the Republic of Pisa to expel the Saracens from Sardinia. In 1088, under the guidance of Pope §YVictor III§!, they united with §YFrance§! and other cities to attack Mahdia (present-day Tunisia). These activities were primarily plunder-driven, especially during the Siege of Mahdia, where §YGenoa§! received 300,000 gold coins, laying the foundation for §YGenoa§!'s later prominence in the Crusades.\n\nThe §YGenoese§! not only provided transport ships for troops and supplies to and from the East but also supplied naval forces and soldiers for the Crusades. In 1097, with a population of only about 10,000, §YGenoa§! dispatched 1,200 combatants to the Crusade. They played a crucial role in the conquests of Antioch (1098), Jerusalem (1099), and Caesarea (1101). During this period, they gained more privileges and colonies, greatly expanding §YGenoa§!'s trade reach. From then on, §YGenoa§! rapidly rose to prominence.\n\nAfter the Frankish-Venetian alliance captured Constantinople in 1204, §YGenoa§!'s trade opportunities in the East significantly diminished. For decades, skirmishes and disputes between §YGenoa§! and §YVenice§! persisted, culminating in the §YWar of Saint Sabas§! from 1256 to 1258.\n\n§YVenice§! and its allies ultimately emerged victorious in this conflict. §YGenoa§! then chose to ally with the exiled Byzantines, aiding Byzantine Emperor §YMichail VIII Palaiologos§! in recapturing Constantinople in 1261. To utilize §YGenoa§!'s navy, Michael VIII signed the §YTreaty of Nymphaion§! with §YGenoa§!. This treaty for the first time formally granted legal status to §YGenoa§!'s Levantine strongholds. Through the treaty, §YGenoa§! could establish settlements and consuls in Ania, Chios, and Lesbos; the emperor also granted Smyrna to the §YGenoese§!, allowing them to trade in any territory under his rule and promising not to allow §YGenoa§!'s enemies into his lands. In return, he only requested that if the empire needed it, §YGenoa§! must provide a fleet of 50 ships. This treaty ensured §YGenoa§!'s hegemony in Black Sea trade for a very long period. Soon after, §YGenoa§! entered its peak, with its created wealth reaching its zenith. In 1293, the value of §YGenoa§!'s maritime exports peaked, amounting to §Yten times§! the value of exports from §YLübeck§!, the most important city of the §YHanseatic League§!, at its peak in 1368.\n\nBetween 1309 and 1313, when Emperor Henry VII levied taxes on Italian cities as an imperial vicar, §YGenoa§! submitted 40,000 gold florins annually, while Venice and Milan behind it paid 29,760 and 28,880 gold florins respectively. At that time, §YGenoa§! could truly be called the wealthiest city in all of Europe.\n\nHowever, internal family conflicts and drastic changes in the external environment caused §YGenoa§!'s decline to be equally rapid. The republican system transformed from early communal rule to foreign rulers and then to a dogeship similar to §YVenice§!. The resulting impacts shook the city of §YGenoa§! from top to bottom. In the Battle of Chioggia in 1379, the §YGenoese§! fleet was decisively defeated by Venice, nearly losing control of eastern routes and incurring massive debt. §YGenoa§! thus began its decline.\n\n§YCurrent Situation§!\n\nThe year is 1437, and Genoa's fate is completely rewritten. After the House of Savoy was ousted from Savoy by the Cathars, who transformed it into a republic, they became down-and-out nobles making a living as mercenaries. But in 1437, the fate of the House of Savoy took a turn.\n\nIn 1437, the Golden Horde was plunged into a rebellion and harassed by the Zaporozhian Hetmanate, becoming severely weakened. Genoese Doge Isnardo Guarco believed this was a perfect time to expand along the Black Sea coast. To enlarge Genoese interests in the Black Sea region, the Doge hired §YFiliberto di Savoia§! to attack the Black Sea coast. As the Golden Horde was preoccupied, §YFiliberto§! quickly captured significant territory in the Azov region. However, §YFiliberto§! informed the Doge via letter that despite frequent victories in his offensive war, he was still short of manpower and needed reinforcements. Doge Isnardo organized a Genoese army to assist §YFiliberto§!, and in 1439, §YFiliberto§! returned to Genoa with news of victory.\n\nBut what the Doge did not expect was that §YFiliberto§!, through military achievements, prestige, bribery, and other means, gained control of the army composed of mercenaries and Genoese citizens, occupied the Republic of Genoa, and became its de facto ruler. §YFiliberto§! retained Genoa's existing state institutions but created a lifelong position for himself, effectively controlling other state organs. Meanwhile, §YFiliberto§!'s regime heavily relied on his mercenary band. He secured many benefits for his mercenaries and continuously recruited mercenaries from other Italian regions to serve him. When §YFiliberto§! died in 1443, his son §YCarlo di Savoia§! created a position for himself titled 'Duke,' making it hereditary. This sparked discontent among the Republican faction in Genoa, leading to a rebellion. The rebels established a base in Liguria but were suppressed by §YCarlo di Savoia§!.\n\n§YCarlo§! consolidated his rule in Genoa. However, because he had used all his forces to quell the domestic rebellion, his overseas territories were captured one by one—the §YCorsicans§! revolted, establishing an independent republic and seeking the Holy Roman Emperor's support; the Despot of Morea, §YTheodoros III§!, occupied Genoa's Aegean stronghold; and §YNikephoros§! and §YTheodoros§! of the §YDucas family§! led troops to occupy the Republic of Genoa's territories along the Black Sea coast.\n\nAlthough §YCarlo§! maintained his rule, Genoa undoubtedly fell into a trough, further exacerbating the already declining state. This nascent mercenary-ruled state will face more challenges: the ambitious northern neighbor §YLombardy§!, the §YCathar§! forces from the west attempting to break into the Apennines, pressure from the old rival §YVenice§!, and rebellions from within the state."

EDG_GEN_st_george_house_desc:0 "The establishment of the world's first chartered bank, the Casa di San Giorgio, in 1407 was a historic milestone. Essentially a consortium of private bondholders, the Casa established direct creditor control over public finance management. Often known as a 'state within a state,' it was needed by Genoa's power elite. Genoa frequently experienced popular uprisings and shifts in the balance of power among competing merchant families. The Casa di San Giorgio effectively shielded fiscal policy and public debt management from popular pressure and political instability, reducing default risk and enabling the commune to borrow at lower interest rates than most rivals. Therefore, creditor control over public finances ensured the Casa's interests aligned with the Republic's. This, in turn, lowered the risk of the Republic defaulting on its debts. Low default risk meant easier access to credit, and abundant cheap credit allowed Genoa to develop into a financial and maritime power in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries—what Fernand Braudel called 'the great age of Genoese finance': for four centuries, 'the Genoese experience' allowed Genoese merchant bankers, through control of capital and credit, to dictate the rhythm of payments and transactions in Europe."
