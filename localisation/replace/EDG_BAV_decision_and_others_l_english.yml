# EDG_string_start_BAV: "\"§MThe Rift§!\"\n\nOn the §YGerman§! lands of the 14th century, the lion of the §MWittelsbach§! House—Holy Roman Emperor §YLouis IV§! (also known as Louis 'the Bavarian')—once reached the peak of his power. This strong-willed monarch not only fiercely contended with the §YHouse of Habsburg§! and the @PAP§YPope§! within the Empire but also focused on the family's foundation—@BAV§YBavaria§!. Between §Y1340§! and §Y1349§!, leveraging his imperial prestige and iron-fisted methods, he temporarily ended the long-standing internal division within the family, reuniting the Duchy of Bavaria, fragmented since §Y1255§!, under one hand. He set his sights on Munich on the banks of the Isar, elevating it to the capital of the unified duchy, thereby establishing the city's future lofty status as the heart of Bavaria.\n\nHowever, the unity forged by §YLouis IV§! was like a meteor streaking across the night sky—brilliant yet fleeting. In §Y1347§!, the emperor died unexpectedly during a hunt, leaving behind a vast §YEmpire§! and a freshly consolidated §YDuchy§!, and six ambitious sons. The vacuum left by his strongman politics was instantly filled by familial power lust, and the tragedy of fraternal strife quickly unfolded. Unable to agree on the distribution of the inheritance, disputes erupted incessantly. Finally, under pressure from the emperor's successor, §YCharles IV§!, the brothers signed the §YTreaty of Landshut§! in §Y1349§!, tearing Bavaria asunder once more.\n\n\"§MResistance§!\"\n\nIn §Y1425§!, Duke §YJohn III§! of Bavaria-Straubing died without leaving a male heir. This fertile land in eastern @BAV§YBavaria§!, strategically important, immediately became the coveted target of the other three §Yduchies§!. All three laid claim to the inheritance, bringing §Rwar§! to the brink. At this critical moment, §YSigismund§! intervened. At the §YImperial Diet of Pressburg§! in §Y1429§!, acting as the Empire's supreme arbiter, he issued a final verdict: the Straubing lands were to be divided into three parts and jointly partitioned among the duchies of @UBV§YMunich§!, @LBV§YLandshut§!, and @ING§YIngolstadt§!.\n\n§YSigismund§! would, as needed, sometimes support Duke §YErnest§! of @UBV§YMunich§! to counter the ambitious §YLouis VII§! 'the Bearded' of @ING§YIngolstadt§!, who was allied with @FA2§YFrance§!; at other times, he would reach brief compromises with §YLouis VII§! in exchange for §Ymoney§! or §Ymilitary§! aid. In this way, he ensured that no single Bavarian branch could become too powerful, thereby threatening the Empire's balance.\n\nTo raise funds, §YSigismund§! often pledged imperial §Ycities§! and §Yterritories§! as collateral for loans from the wealthy @BAV§YBavarian§! dukes. For instance, he granted mortgages on cities like §YNuremberg§! to @BAV§YBavarian§! dukes. This made his relationship with the @BAV§YBavarian§! princes not merely one of superior and subordinate, but a complex §Ycreditor§! relationship. Every ruling he made in Bavaria likely involved §Ymonetary transactions§! and exchanges of §Yinterest§!. §YSigismund§! utilized the internal strife of the §MWittelsbach§! family to serve his own §Yimperial§! throne and §YEmpire§! policies, while simultaneously deepening the complexity of @BAV§YBavaria§!'s internal conflicts.\n\n§MNow, his life is also nearing its end. Perhaps Sigismund's demise will be the perfect opportunity for us to reunify Bavaria.§!\n\n\"§MUndercurrents§!\"\n\nThe §YEuchites§! were a sect that emerged around the year §Y370§!. They maintained long-term contact with the §YBogomils§!, the §YBosnian Church§!, the §YPataria movement§!, and the §YCathars§!. Due to the spread of the §YBlack Death§!, the failure of the §YAlbigensian Crusade§!, and the ensuing §Ygreat upheaval§! in the Catholic world, the Euchites, who shared many similarities with the §YCathars§!, rapidly spread throughout the §YGerman regions§!. Many from the lower classes suffering under immense social pressure and the upper classes indulging in hedonism found solace in this sect that advocated for human liberation. Many §YGerman§! lords also believed that tacitly allowing the increase of §YEuchite§! followers could repopulate their lands and thus permitted this §Yfaith§! to spread within their domains.\n\nHowever, the doctrines of the §YEuchites§! fundamentally §Rconflicted§! with the orthodox beliefs of the §YCatholic Church§!. The §YEuchites§! denied the doctrine of Transubstantiation, viewing the Eucharist merely as a symbolic commemorative rite, not the actual transformation into Christ's body and blood. Additionally, the §YEuchites§! emphasized a direct relationship between the individual and God, opposing the Church's role as an intermediary, which created a sharp opposition to §YCatholic§! doctrine. The §YEuchites§! also advocated for simplified rituals, opposing the Church's opulence and authority, views that further §Rangered§! the §YCatholic Church§!.\n\nAs the §YEuchites§! spread throughout the §YGerman§! regions, the §YCatholic Church§! began to feel §Rthreatened§!. The Church viewed the §YEuchites§! as §Rheretics§!, believing their doctrines undermined the Church's authority and influence. To curb the §YEuchites§!' growth, the §YCatholic Church§! took a series of measures, including §Yconvening church councils§!, §Yissuing papal bulls§!, and §Yemploying the Inquisition§! to §Rtry and punish§! §YEuchite§! adherents. These measures somewhat contained the spread of the §YEuchites§!, but also triggered further social §Rturmoil and conflict§!."
EDG_string_start_BAV: "\"§MThe Rift§!\"\n\nIn the mid-14th century, the §MWittelsbach§! family reached the zenith of its power under the rule of Holy Roman Emperor §YLouis IV§! (also known as Louis 'the Bavarian'). This formidable monarch, while engaged in a protracted geopolitical struggle against the @WUR §YHouse of Habsburg§! and @PAP §Ythe Pope§!, dedicated himself to consolidating his absolute rule over the family's ancestral base - @BAV §YBavaria§!. Between §Y1340§! and §Y1349§!, leveraging imperial authority and political acumen, Louis IV temporarily ended the chronic fragmentation that had plagued Bavaria since §Y1255§!, bringing the duchy back under unified governance and establishing Munich on the Isar River as the administrative center.\n\nHowever, this unity, dependent on the strength of a single ruler, proved short-lived. In §Y1347§!, the Emperor died unexpectedly during a hunt, creating a severe power vacuum. His vast §Yimperial§! holdings and the recently consolidated §Yduchy§! ignited fierce succession disputes among his six sons. Unable to reach consensus on territorial division, internal family conflicts rapidly intensified. Finally, under political pressure from the succeeding Emperor §YCharles IV§!, the parties signed the §YTreaty of Landshut Partition§! in §Y1349§!, plunging Bavaria once more into legal fragmentation and sowing the seeds for a century of internal strife.\n\n\"§MCrisis§!\"\n\nEntering the 15th century, the family's divisions deepened further. In §Y1425§!, Duke §YJohn III§! of Bavaria-Straubing died without an heir. This territory, located in eastern @BAV §YBavaria§!, was fertile and strategically valuable, immediately triggering inheritance disputes among the three branches: @UBV §YMunich§!, @ING §YIngolstadt§!, and @LBV §YLandshut§!. With all three claiming legitimate legal rights, the risk of §Rwar§! escalated sharply.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Emperor §YSigismund§! intervened as mediator. At the §YImperial Diet of Pressburg§! in §Y1429§!, in his capacity as the §YEmpire's supreme arbiter§!, he issued a final verdict: the §YStraubing§! lands were to be divided into three parts, allocated to the three duchies respectively. While this ruling temporarily quelled armed conflict, it was, in essence, a manifestation of §YSigismund's§! balance-of-power policy—by partitioning the territory, he ensured no single @BAV §YBavarian§! branch could amass hegemony sufficient to threaten the §YImperial§! throne.\n\n\"§MThe Wise§!\"\n\nIn the decade following the Pressburg verdict, Bavaria's political landscape shifted subtly. Unlike the conservatism of the @UBV §YMunich§! line and the radicalism of @ING §YIngolstadt§!'s §YLouis VII§!, the Duchy of @LBV §YLandshut§!, under the governance of §YGeorge I§! (later known as 'the Wise'), adopted a more pragmatic geopolitical strategy. §YGeorge I§! understood that mere military expansion was unlikely to succeed under imperial intervention. Therefore, he focused on internal administrative reforms and economic accumulation, gradually making Landshut the most affluent among the three branches.\n\nThe 'Wise' §YGeorge§! did not directly involve himself in the open conflict between Munich and Ingolstadt but instead looked southeast. Through intricate diplomacy, he established a stable alliance with the Archbishopric of @SLZ §YSalzburg§!, thereby gaining control over the vital salt trade, which he used as leverage in internal Wittelsbach family councils. His presence became the only stabilizing factor within Bavaria besides the Emperor, a potential opponent the other two ducal lines had to guard against.\n\n\"§MResistance§!\"\n\nBy the year §Y1444§!, Holy Roman Emperor §YSigismund§! had entered the twilight of his life, yet he clung tenaciously to power. To maintain his lavish court and counter external threats, Sigismund had woven a complex web of debt. He frequently pledged imperial §Ycities§! and §Yterritories§! as collateral to secure loans from wealthy @BAV §YBavarian§! princes. Among these, the jurisdictional rights over the Imperial Free City of §YRegensburg§! had become a focal point of bargaining between the Emperor and Duke §YErnst§! of @UBV §YMunich§!.\n\nThe situation was exceptionally delicate: §YLouis VII§! of @ING §YIngolstadt§!, relying on an alliance with @FRA §YFrance§!, sought to challenge the Emperor's authority; §YErnst§! of @UBV §YMunich§!, leveraging his financial §Yclaims§!, aimed to annex §YRegensburg§! through legal channels before the Emperor's death; while the 'Wise' §YGeorge§! of @LBV §YLandshut§! watched and waited for the chaos that would accompany the imperial succession. §YSigismund§! exploited these intricate conflicts of interest to barely maintain the §YEmpire's§! fragile equilibrium in Bavaria. §OYet, everyone knew that with the Emperor's life counting down, a storm concerning Bavaria's unification and the Empire's fate was imminent.§!\n\n\"§MUndercurrents§!\"\n\nThe §YEuchite§! sect originated around §Y370§! AD. Its theological thought shares historical roots with other heterodox movements such as the §YBogomils§!, the §YBosnian Church§!, and the §YCathars§!. Influenced by the social crisis triggered by the §YBlack Death§!, geopolitical shifts following the §YAlbigensian Crusade§!, and the §YGreat Upheaval§! within the Catholic world, the §YEuchites§! experienced a revival and spread in the §YGerman lands§!. Some members of the lower classes burdened by heavy social pressures and some of the upper classes seeking spiritual solace resonated with the sect's tenets, while certain §YGerman§! lords, motivated by utilitarian considerations to expand their territorial populations, adopted a tacitly permissive stance towards the spread of this §Yfaith§!.\n\nHowever, the core doctrines of the §YEuchites§! are fundamentally at §Rodds§! with the orthodox theology of the §YCatholic Church§!. The §YEuchites§! reject the doctrine of 'transubstantiation,' viewing the Eucharist as merely a symbolic ritual rather than the substantial transformation of Christ's body. Furthermore, the sect emphasizes a direct connection between the believer and God, denying the necessity of the Church as an intermediary, which directly contradicts the §YCatholic Church's§! hierarchical structure. Its advocacy for simplified religious rites and opposition to the Church's temporal authority further §Renraged§! the §YCatholic Church§!.\n\nAs the §YEuchites§! infiltrated the §YGerman§! regions, the §YCatholic Church§! perceived them as a grave §Rthreat§! and §Rheresy§!, believing their doctrines aimed to subvert the Church's authority. To curb the sect's spread, the §YCatholic Church§! employed a series of measures including §Yconvening councils§!, §Yissuing papal bulls§!, and operating the §YInquisition§!, imposing severe §Rtrial and punishment§! on §YEuchite§! adherents. Although this high-pressure policy somewhat suppressed the sect's expansion, it also intensified religious and social conflicts, leading to ongoing §Rupheaval and strife§!."

desc_EDG_BAV_alois_personality: "Since childhood, Alois disliked the court's rigid formalities. After returning from Lombardy, he often disguised himself and roamed Bavaria's mountains, rivers, and lakes with an ancient lute.\n\nOnce, he arrived at a small village at the foot of the Alps, home to barely twenty households, secluded against mountains and water. When Alois entered the village, villagers were preparing for summer pasture migration. Unaware of his true identity, they took him for a wandering minstrel.\n\nEvenings, villagers gathered under the great oak at the village entrance. Alois played the lute and sang. That night, an old farmer sat beside him, handing him a pipe: 'Young man, you're no ordinary vagrant.' Alois was silent a moment: 'I... indeed wasn't always this.'\n\nThe old farmer glanced at Alois's hands, then pointed towards his distant daughter, drawing on his pipe: 'She's like you, fond of poetry and song—truly a headache.' Alois smiled: 'Is that so? I too have a troublesome brother.' The two talked pleasantly all night.\n\nNext dawn, Alois prepared to leave. The old farmer saw him off, handing him a small cloth bundle: 'Some provisions. Young man, visit the village more often!' 'I shall,' he said, 'if possible.'"

incidents_bavarian_unification: "The Unification of Bavaria"
incidents_bavarian_unification_member_alert: "Although Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of the House of Wittelsbach briefly unified the Duchy of Bavaria between 1340-1349, setting its capital in Munich, discord among his six sons after his death led the junior family lines to further fracture into branches such as Bavaria-Landshut, Bavaria-Straubing, Bavaria-Ingolstadt, and Bavaria-Munich. In 1425, with the death of Duke John III, the male line of the Straubing branch died out. In 1429, through the arbitration of Emperor Sigismund, his lands were partitioned among the Dukes of Bavaria-Munich, Bavaria-Landshut, and Bavaria-Ingolstadt. Since then, Bavaria has effectively been ruled by three branches of the Wittelsbach family. However, recently, the Duke from Landshut has seized control of Munich and Ingolstadt by force, upsetting the delicate balance in the Bavarian region. They have now submitted a proclamation for the unification of Bavaria to the Emperor, which has subsequently found its way onto the round table of the Imperial Diet. Although their recent aggressive expansion has aroused discontent among a significant portion of the Imperial princes—with some Dukes fearing their territories might be next—many others believe that the unification of the House of Wittelsbach will strengthen the Empire's overall power, enabling it to better resist foreign invasions."

incidents_hab_bav_war_member_alert: "The situation has surpassed the most pessimistic expectations of any Imperial prince. Holy Roman Emperor [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] personally led a massive army across the border and launched a full-scale invasion of Bavaria. This unexpected war has been dubbed 'The Rhine Conflict.' According to the Emperor and the Pope's own statements, their actions are 'punishing the unfaithful believers' and will 'not harm ordinary civilians,' yet their actual conduct starkly contradicts these claims. The Emperor's forces swept through like a flood or a beast, burning villages, plundering farmlands, and ruthlessly trampling the land diligently cultivated by Bavaria. Since the conflict erupted, thousands of civilians have perished in the flames of war, and tens of thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes, becoming homeless refugees. Even more shockingly, the Emperor has mobilized the Church's crusading forces. Soldiers driven by religious fanaticism showed no mercy on the battlefield and were especially cruel towards Bavaria's ordinary populace. Some Imperial princes are appalled and enraged by these events, beginning to question the Emperor's motives and actions, viewing his invasion not merely as a matter of religious faith but more like an ambitious war for power and territorial expansion."
