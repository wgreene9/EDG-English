Now, however, this region has become a contested center for feuding Mamluk warlords, leaving the vulnerable Coptic community in peril. In the name of blessed Solomon, we cannot allow our pilgrimage route to be blocked by infidel armies.

Now, with the fall of the Sahada dynasty, some clergy propose returning the Ark to its rightful place. However, sending the Ark back to a city beyond our control is undoubtedly naive and foolish. Therefore, we must seize Jerusalem and the surrounding lands, reclaim the ancient domain of King Solomon, and make the Holy City our new center of power.

However, circumstances took a drastic turn after Queen Gudit and her Semien warriors sacked Aksum and brought the Aksumite dynasty to an end. Not long after, the empire fractured into several tribal states. In the past, we were preoccupied with wars against the Sultanate of Ifat in the southeast and unable to focus on the north. The Sahada dynasty, which controlled vast territories in Arabia, took control of Egypt in 1380, ousting the Mamluks and becoming the Great Maliks of Egypt. Since the death of Nasir I in 1391, the Sahada dynasty has faced continuous rebellion and turmoil. Now, their complete collapse is only a matter of time, presenting us with a perfect opportunity to restore our northern borders.

Now, all this has been ignited by the grand Malik Wars, and the once-mighty Fayoum system has crumbled. Today, neither the Sahada dynasty nor the Mamluk warlords can stand as enemies of the [Root.GovernmentName].

EDG_ETH_mission_5_9_desc:0 "The ancient holy fire has been extinguished. The newborn Imam has adorned the turquoise throne with lion and sun, but the ancient foe of the empire is no longer what it was. Yet the heirs of Aksum will never forget the banners and drums of the Sasanians. Now, the false King of Kings has finally bowed before the glory of Solomon. Dawn comes again; there is no more revenge or darkness to heal. All orchards will bloom, the specter of war has vanished, and the tragedy of Aksum shall not repeat."

EDG_ETH_mission_5_11_title:0 "Following Saint Anthony"
EDG_ETH_mission_5_11_desc:0 "Saint Anthony was a pioneer of Christian monasticism, revered as a Desert Father. Quiet and of excellent character, he prayed and lived as a hermit in a deserted fortress in the Egyptian desert, seen as a model by the world. He withdrew from the world but did not abandon it; during Roman persecutions, he twice went to Alexandria willing to share martyrdom with his brethren, fearlessly proclaiming the true faith, so much so that even his enemies were moved by his virtue and spirit. Reflecting on Saint Anthony's life, Saint Augustine exclaimed, 'We were amazed to hear that, in such a recent age, in our own time, your miraculous signs displayed irrefutable proof within the pure faith of the Catholic Church.' Now that we have restored Coptic rule over Egypt, we should repair the remnants of the Monastery of Saint Anthony and continue his spirit of piety."

EDG_ETH_mission_5_14_title:0 "Restart Trade"
EDG_ETH_mission_5_14_desc:0 "The port city of Suakin is clearly an important harbor in Red Sea trade. Although no records mention it as part of the Aksumite Empire, until it fell into Muslim hands, many [Root.GetAdjective] Christians still lived there. Therefore, we have ample reason to seize this port city, liberate the few Christians who may still remain hidden there, and restart our once-flourishing trade port."

EDG_ETH_mission_5_15_desc:0 "An empire of our immense prestige and scale often faces multiple problems, such as mismanagement and rampant corruption. By imposing our trade practices on key foreign trade ports and formalizing our own economic system, we can introduce a new currency that will undoubtedly reshape the world, its influence and power extending far beyond our borders."

EDG_AKS_mission_1_20_desc:0 "To the west of the Horn of Africa lies the Sahel region, a passable strip between the desolate Sahara Desert and the dense jungles of the Congo Basin. It would be best for us to control this corridor, establishing a bridge between West Africa and the Horn of Africa."

EDG_AKS_mission_5_20_desc:0 "Our pioneers have traversed dense rainforests to reach the heartland of Central Africa. The people here are almost completely foreign to us, and their current systems remain vastly underdeveloped compared to Aksum. Without a doubt, we must kindly preach the Coptic faith to them and assist them in modernization."

Modernized armies, capable cabinets, and numerous cultural innovations mean no one can mock the people here anymore.
