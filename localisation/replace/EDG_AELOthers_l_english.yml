EDG_AELEvents.0.desc:0 "Although the Church of the Crusade was completed in 1443, interior renovations are still required, and this expense was not anticipated in advance. The royal family must fund this work themselves.\n\nIf we have sufficient funds, we can consider undertaking the renovations. However, if we are temporarily unable to bear the cost, we can postpone them until later."
