EDG_flavorBRA_mission.1.d:0 "Pressed by lack of funds and political instability, our ancestors who once governed the Margraviate of Brandenburg pragmatically pawned the lands of Neumark to the Teutonic Order. However, immigrants from Brandenburg have previously claimed ownership of this region, and the local burghers assert that the Order entirely neglects them. \n\n The Teutonic Order is prepared to mortgage Neumark, yet the burgher class of Neumark opposes this resolution. Provided the Order receives adequate compensation, we have good reason to believe the Grand Master would accept our proposal to repurchase the province."
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.1.a:0 "Offer the Grand Master a generous price."
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.1.b:0 "We must conserve our funds."

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.2.t:0 "The Fate of Neumark"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.2.d:0 "Although Neumark was originally part of Brandenburg, the former Margraves first pledged it as security and then outright sold this land to us to raise funds. Distant and frequently troubled by robber barons, this territory causes more trouble than the value it could provide under our rule. \n\n We have received an offer from Brandenburg to repurchase Neumark. Should we accept? If we accept, it seems unlikely we would ever reclaim Neumark; however, they are willing to pay a substantial sum for it, and we could certainly make good use of that capital."
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.2.a:0 "Let them pay!"

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.3.t:0 "The Copper Crown of Poland"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.3.d:0 "After the premature death of Casimir III, Poland has long been in a state of near partition, with the central royal court in Kraków existing in name only, and a Hussite republic formed in the south. The Duchy of Mazovia and the Duchy of Poznań have been restlessly stirring. For years, they have fought amongst themselves without restoring stability to the Polish lands. Following the first arrow shot by the Hohenzollerns into Sandomierz in the name of 'revolution,' a second arrow from the House of Hohenzollern has now pierced this sacred Polish soil. Today, Poland lies entirely within the embrace of the Hohenzollern family. We shall enjoy Poland's gentle lands to the fullest, wear the Copper Crown symbolizing absolute rule over Poland, and guide the war-torn Poland into an era of peace and prosperity."

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.4.d:0 "As the Hohenzollern family's influence on the European continent grows ever greater, reaching its peak upon our departure from the Holy Roman Empire, we have revealed our ambitions without reservation. Several weak and cowardly cities within the Danish Confederation have keenly sensed the threat. They have attempted to seek aid from the Holy Roman Emperor to guarantee the autonomy of the Danish Confederation. Undoubtedly, this is also a means for the Emperor to sanction us. If the Holy Roman Emperor ignores this request, the Danish Confederation will not dare oppose us. If the Emperor sternly refuses, it will prove we have no retreat left and can only wage war to force the Emperor to hand over Denmark."

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.5.t:0 "Denmark's Plea for Aid"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.5.d:0 "The northern Hohenzollerns, disregarding the Emperor's authority, have issued an ultimatum to Denmark, demanding their submission to Hohenzollern rule. Historically, Denmark has respected the supreme authority of the Holy Roman Emperor. Faced with the Danish Confederation's request to maintain its independence, as the Holy Roman Emperor, we are duty-bound to protect their legitimate past rights. However, our influence within the Holy Roman Empire has now sharply declined. Should we wage an uncertain war over the distant and difficult-to-reach Danish Confederation against the newly ascendant Hohenzollerns in the north?"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.5.a:0 "We must avoid confronting their might for now."
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.5.b:0 "For the sake of the Holy Roman Empire, we must do this."

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.26.t:0 "The Emperor's Concession"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.26.d:0 "Due to our formidable military strength, the Emperor ultimately chose to concede, bowing to us and renouncing protection over the Danish Confederation. Now, the Danish Confederation is ours for the taking. We are entitled to demand their allegiance and become our fief."

EDG_flavorBRA_mission.6.d:0 "The House of Welf, its fame long-lasting within the Empire, its achievements passed down through the ages—until its very last moments, the Duke of Saxony remained the undeniable northwestern pillar of the Empire. Yet, his erroneous vacillations left him unsatisfying to the Emperor, the Pope, and the pietists alike. In the end, the House of Welf was betrayed by the 'heretics' he had generously accepted, and was utterly defeated on the battlefield by the Hohenzollern armies. Once, the Hohenzollerns were but worms mired in the swamps of Franconia and Swabia, gazing in admiration at the immense glory of those proud nobles. Now, standing in this position, the Hohenzollerns finally realize their place is enough to be recorded in history. With the Grand Marshal vanquished, no one in the Empire dares look down upon the Hohenzollerns, not even the Emperor, who is paying close attention to our next moves, as are all territorial nobles adjacent to Hohenzollern lands. We must reassess our position within the Empire—repeat the mistakes of the past, or unsheath the blade?"
EDG_flavorBRA_mission.6.a:0 "With the incompetent Grand Marshal of Saxony gone, we shall become the Empire's firmest pillar."

We once fancied ourselves the true heirs of Franconia, yet were treated as mere pawns by families like the Habsburgs, deemed unfit for the main stage, only granted limited assistance—so much so that we spent our entire fortune and pleaded earnestly just to gain Habsburg favor. Now, we return to Franconia. The nobles of this region no longer have the chance to ignore us; instead, they will respectfully present the crown. Amidst flowers and applause, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reclaims what was once dreamed of: the ducal crown of the Duchy of Franconia! And Franconia itself!"

In those days, we struggled bitterly in this treacherous region, never attaining the status we desired, eventually even being driven out of Swabia, retaining only Ansbach and Bayreuth. As we return with overwhelming force, the nobles of Swabia have no choice but to pay lip service, proclaiming us the true masters of Swabia. However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] understands that without our current strength, how could we become the "true masters"?

The various rebel factions, no longer united as they fought over the spoils, gave Albert the opportunity to defeat them piecemeal. However, Albert knew his abilities were not even half of his brother's; his current successes were partly due to luck. He was powerless to quell the long-brewing conflicts, and every class seemed dissatisfied with his handling. Albert's political acumen was insufficient to fully resolve the crisis. \n\n Just as Albert was overwhelmed, even considering shutting himself away and refusing all action, joyful news arrived from Sandomierz. His son, who had been gaining experience under the tutelage of [LER.Monarch.GetName], learned of the family's plight in Poland and felt duty-bound to return. \n\n Frederick William of Hohenzollern was Albert's greatest pride. Unlike his father, Frederick showed remarkable intelligence, bravery, and determination from a young age. At just twelve, he chose to travel and gain experience abroad (in Sandomierz). He possessed a strong sense of responsibility and keen insight into people's hearts, as if heaven-sent for the future of the House of Hohenzollern. \n\n Frederick intended to assist his father in resolving the conflict, but Albert was utterly exhausted by the crisis, suffering from severe depression. This provided the young Frederick with a way to step onto the historical stage. \n\n 'My son, will you become the new head of the House of Hohenzollern, Margrave of Brandenburg, Count of Ansbach, and Count of Bayreuth?'"

With masterful handling skills, [Root.Monarch.GetName] employed tactics of coercion and inducement, aligning with some to attack others, uniting the majority while targeting the minority, making everyone realize the exceptional nature of this young duke. \n\n [Root.Monarch.GetName] seemed a born leader, possessing extraordinary charisma. Friends who negotiated with him sang his praises, and enemies who opposed him dared not underestimate him. \n\n Thus, through [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s skillful maneuvering, he successfully balanced the interests of all classes, resolved most conflicts, and used decisive force to strike down those who opposed him. \n\n His friends found him as refreshing as a spring breeze; his enemies felt his piercing cold. \n\n In the end, the young duke quelled this prolonged strife, won the people's favor, and was generous in sharing glory with his subjects."

Although the Hohenzollern family suffered heavy losses and the Margraviate of Brandenburg nearly became a ruin, they hadn't anticipated the new duke's swift and decisive methods, nor that the Hohenzollerns' fate wasn't sealed. On the contrary, it solidified Hohenzollern rule. \n\n Faced with this situation, the shadowy masterminds realized they could no longer idly watch the Hohenzollerns permanently eliminate future threats and decided to intervene personally. \n\n Thus, a new upheaval, instigated by local nobles and interfered with by external princes, unfolded once more. \n\n Their actions were orderly, their resolve united. \n\n They proudly pointed their swords at the Hohenzollerns, sending a clear message: Outsiders cannot rule here!

A Hohenzollern failure in rule would not only undermine the authority of the newly enthroned Habsburgs but could also expose the secret pact, leading to an unspeakable scandal for the House of Habsburg. \n\n Since the Emperor currently admires the Hohenzollern family and intends to forge an unbreakable bond with them, they have secretly dispatched an envoy to meet with the Hohenzollern head, offering an aid agreement."

His excellent acting and the nobles' blind arrogance prevented them from realizing that [Root.Monarch.GetName] had no intention of making peace. They nearly reached what appeared to be mutually acceptable terms. \n\n However, one morning, the noble representatives resting on the Spree Island were rudely awakened—a scenario they had never encountered during previous talks. Guards looked down upon them and announced: 'Duke [Root.Monarch.GetName] has issued an order: your claimed rights are not recognized!'

EDG_flavorBRA.1.d:0 "The Duke of Brandenburg was once also the Elector of Brandenburg, holding a transcendent status. Yet, successive rulers of Brandenburg vacillated due to their allegiances and fragmented due to succession issues. In 1411, Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, was elected King of the Romans and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1433, his realms spanning Hungary and Bohemia, marking a time of great power. However, Sigismund cared little for the impoverished region of Brandenburg. After becoming King of Bohemia, he shifted his focus and energy to ruling Bohemia and Hungary. Even the title of Elector of Brandenburg was forcibly stripped and transferred to the Kingdom of Bohemia. \n\n Thus, Brandenburg faded into obscurity, merely a dark pearl beside the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary. \n\n Now, Emperor Sigismund may die without an heir, and the Brandenburg nobility secretly resents his transfer of the Electorate. Seizing the opportunity, using the death of Albert II of Habsburg as a pretext, they have pressured the aged Sigismund to renounce posthumous rule over Brandenburg. \n\n Meanwhile, far away in Franconia, William of Hohenzollern, head of the House, was overwhelmed by the treacherous Franconian political situation and his own waning power—a slow death. Yet, at this moment, William of Hohenzollern keenly perceived an opportunity. \n\n He made an offer that Frederick III, Count of Württemberg, who was troubled over control of Franconia, could hardly refuse. \n\n In exchange for centuries of accumulated family wealth, the still prosperous County of Ansbach, and the County of Bayreuth pledging allegiance to the House of Habsburg after the Duke of Franconia's death—thus securing his control over Franconia—the agreement stipulated that, should a Habsburg ascend to the Imperial throne, they would support and authorize the transfer of the Margraviate of Brandenburg to Hohenzollern rule. \n\n On one hand: the wealthy County of Ansbach, County of Bayreuth, accumulated riches, and control over Franconia. On the other: a Margraviate of Brandenburg that was already confirmed impossible to inherit peacefully, stripped of its Electorate status, rife with disobedience, and utterly impoverished. \n\n The answer was clear. Count Frederick III of Württemberg accepted the terms, and a secret, undisclosable pact was forged between them. \n\n The fate of Brandenburg would change, contingent upon the possible entry of the Hohenzollern family."
