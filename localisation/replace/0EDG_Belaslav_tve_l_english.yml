EDG_tve_missions.101t:0 "The Tver-Moscow War"
EDG_tve_missions.101d:0 "In 1442, Prince Vasily I of Tver died. The will he left stipulated that the Principality of Tver, the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod, and other territories, along with the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir, were all to be inherited by his son Mikhail. However, Vasily I's brother, Rostislav of Moscow, disputed the legitimacy of this will, citing the ancient Rus' tradition that gave him the right to inherit the throne of Tver. Thus, he launched a war against Mikhail, once again plunging Northeastern Rus' into civil war. Through unexpected, swift assaults, Rostislav gained the upper hand against Mikhail. Yet Rostislav's victory was short-lived, for in 1444, he too succumbed to illness and died. His son Alexander inherited the Muscovite throne. Alexander no longer had sufficiently legitimate grounds to challenge Mikhail's right of inheritance, while Mikhail, in turn, sought to strip Alexander of his own inheritance. In the blink of an eye, the roles of Moscow and Tver reversed..."

EDG_tve_missions.204d:0 "The wars among the Rus' princes have lasted for centuries. The various branches of the Rurikids have engaged in endless feuds and struggles, even under the Tatar yoke. This absurd state of affairs must be rectified. All of Rus' must be united under the rule of a single great prince, and that prince should naturally be our Prince of Tver, the heir to the Grand Prince of Vladimir. The Grand Prince of Tver shall become the true ruler of Rus', ending the civil wars among the Rurikids and bringing lasting peace and prosperity to the lands of Rus'."
EDG_tve_missions.204A:0 "Ura!"

EDG_tve_missions.205t:0 "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues Since the Founding of Rus'"
EDG_tve_missions.205d:0 "Rus' originated in Novgorod, but its true prosperity came in Kyiv. In the past, the Grand Princes of Kyiv, who ruled from that city, were the most senior, highest in lineage, and most powerful princes in Rus'. For centuries, Kyiv was the economic, political, and cultural center of Rus'. She is the mother of Rus' cities, the city Rus' yearned for. However, one very noticeable fact is that the Grand Prince of Tver has almost no connection to the Grand Prince of Kyiv, nor is the Grand Prince of Tver the most prestigious clan elder within the Rurikid family. In other words, while claiming the title of Grand Prince of Kyiv and making Kyiv the capital might provide some legitimacy to our rule, that legitimacy is minimal. Moreover, we hold no claim to Kyiv. But the Principality of Vladimir has also left us a legacy. We can claim that starting from Vsevolod the Big Nest, Vladimir became the successor to Kyiv, and Kyiv lost its status as the center of all Rus' at that time. The Grand Prince of Vladimir is the true Grand Prince of all Rus'. Perhaps many South Rus' nobles will scoff at this, but it poses no threat to our rule."
EDG_tve_missions.205A:0 "Hmph, how can ancient inheritance systems constrain modern people? I am certainly the Grand Prince of Kyiv!"

EDG_tve_re.101t:0 "The Novgorod Question"
EDG_tve_re.101d:0 "Tver has largely taken control of Northeastern Rus', except for Novgorod, which has maintained a tradition of autonomy for centuries. We can certainly claim the Novgorodian throne; after all, it is natural for the Grand Prince of Vladimir to simultaneously hold the title of Prince of Novgorod. However, this would inevitably lead to constraints from the Novgorod Veche, and they might even rebel against us in the future. Alternatively, we could directly eliminate the Novgorodian regime, appoint Tver officials, and install a Tver prince, solving the matter once and for all. However, within the Novgorod Veche, there is also a faction inclined towards us. We could first make contact with them to gauge their intentions."

EDG_tve_re.201t:0 "The War of Hawovo"
EDG_tve_re.201d:0 "No matter how the times change, the descendants of Rurik remain the most powerful family in the lands of Rus'. The various Rurikids rule almost every claimed inch of Rus' territory. They guard their domains, protect trade, maintain rule alongside the boyars, and form marriage alliances with foreign rulers... After each Rurikid city-state inevitably became an independent state, only one thing remained unchanged: Kyiv's supreme status in Rus'.\n\nPerhaps other Rus' princes still agree to uphold the nominal authority of Kyiv, but the Grand Prince of Vladimir — that is, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Tver — will wait no longer. For Rus' cannot perish in civil war while clinging to a ruined Kyiv. Rus' needs a new mode of rule, not ancient traditions.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows this will be a spark. The great boyars suppressed daily, the branches of the Rurikid family, dissenters in newly conquered regions... all may use this as a pretext to challenge him. But [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] firmly believes that since his power comes from God, then the power of the boyars must yield to him.\n\nThis will be a great war, but as long as we win this war, all opposition from opponents will be rendered void!"

EDG_tve_re.202d:0 "War has once again inflicted wounds upon this ravaged land; this is the price of war.\n\nRus' has long grown accustomed to the frequent wars among its princes. For centuries, princes have constantly schemed, formed alliances, and waged war against each other for their own interests, with the result that the lands of Rus' never knew a moment of peace, not even during Mongol rule.\n\nBut now this will change. Independent or semi-independent princes will no longer exist on the lands of Vladimir. The power of the boyars must submit to the royal authority of Vladimir. All rebellion is declared at an end. The influence of the great boyars can no longer constrain our great prince.\n\nFrom this day forward, in Vladimir, only royal authority is supreme."
EDG_tve_re.202A:0 "Across the lands of Rus', let all words be one! Ura!"

EDG_tve_re.203d:0 "Ancient Rus' has a rich legacy. We are the heirs of the prosperous Principality of Vladimir. As the ruling center of Rus' after the decline of Kyiv, Vladimir has the responsibility to inherit Rus' legacy and rejuvenate it. Now, we shall inherit the name of Vladimir, and the Rus' Empire shall be reborn."

EDG_tve_re.204d:0 "The Church wields immense power in Rus', and religion has become an intrinsic part of the people's lives. Consequently, the Church has grown bold, holding vast tracts of land where it operates autonomously. Although the Church is under the control of secular authority, these lands controlled by the Church still hinder our local governance. To prevent them from becoming a future scourge, we must reclaim these lands now!"
EDG_tve_re.205t:0 "Reclaim Veche Lands in [appanage_province.GetName]"
EDG_tve_re.205d:0 "The citizen Veche is a traditional urban governing institution in Rus', having effectively controlled cities for centuries. However, for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the existence of the Veche means his will cannot be fully implemented, and cities will not obey him completely. Therefore, the era of Veche rule over cities must be decisively ended!"
EDG_tve_re.206t:0 "Reclaim Boyar Lands in [appanage_province.GetName]"
EDG_tve_re.206d:0 "In past times, Tver was, at most, a meeting place for the various hereditary princes. Regardless of which prince, their lands and privileges were inherited from their ancestors.

These groups harbor deep resentment towards these vested interest classes. A lesser boyar has delivered a letter of accusation to the Grand Prince's hands, with irrefutable evidence. He can serve as an example, encouraging all who serve the Grand Prince to report those traitors to the state."

Peresvetov argued that the true support of the state was not the 'dignitaries' or the 'lazy wealthy,' but the 'warriors'—the landed nobles who served in the military.

Now that the rebellious Prince of Moscow has been defeated, these boyars are tearfully pleading with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], claiming that the Prince of Moscow deceived and coerced them into participating in this rebellion.

We once successfully defeated the Swedes under the leadership of Alexander Nevsky. But now, the greedy Swedes have launched another invasion against us, and this time they possess greater strength. Many defeatist advisors have already emerged within the Veche. Now we can only choose: either fight to the bitter end and defeat the Swedes like the heroes at the Neva River, or seek assistance from another country, though that would require sacrificing some freedom and independence—but then, when survival itself is at stake, what is freedom and independence?"

This is not surprising, because in theory, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] holds an absolutely legitimate claim to the Grand Prince's throne of Novgorod, and once [Root.Monarch.GetName] becomes Novgorod's ruler, we certainly have an obligation to protect Novgorod."

For a long time, Nizhny Novgorod has been a highly autonomous territory, operating in sync with the Prince of Tver through the cooperation of the Nizhny Novgorod boyars.

Alas, the boyars do not consider that war-weary Rus' needs a strong monarch to maintain peace, nor do they consider that the long-suffering Rus' people need peace under the Grand Prince to recover and rebuild.

Their lineages are ancient and glorious, while these minor nobles are not worth mentioning. Elevating these minor nobles will destroy the traditions of the boyars and undermine the very foundation of Rus' rule."
