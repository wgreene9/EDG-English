The blessed §YGerard§! is widely recognized as the Order's first Grand Master, founding the precursor to the Knights Hospitaller and earning reverence as a Defender of the Holy Sepulchre. During the First Crusade, the Hospitallers were already a vital force among the Crusaders. These brothers, devoted to the ideals of healing and salvation, also took up arms for the battlefield.\n\nBut Crusader power was not consolidated in §YJerusalem§!; after brief victories came the resurgence of the infidels. Whether the Zengids, Ayyubids, or Mamluks, all dealt heavy blows to the Crusader states until they were driven from the Levant. In 1291, the last Crusader mainland stronghold, Acre, was utterly destroyed, and the Ninth Crusade ended in disastrous defeat. Thereafter, European kings became mired in continental wars, and no further crusades to the Holy Land were launched.\n\nDriven from the mainland, the Knights Hospitaller, leveraging the decline of the §YByzantine§! Empire, secured §YRhodes§! as their headquarters, resisting ambitious infidel navies. As maritime guardians of Christendom, the Order repeatedly repelled naval ventures by Turks and Mamluks, sustaining themselves through raiding infidels and receiving donations from Catholic nations. A century of resistance was not without achievement: the knights once held the northern port of §YSmyrna§!, but this beautiful harbor was seized by the brutal Ottomans and then usurped by a group of Byzantine refugees. Like their neighbor §YCyprus§!, the Knights Hospitaller, caught between great powers, resemble a flickering candle in the wind—all efforts seemingly a struggle for survival.\n\nTimes have changed. The §YSakhada§! Dynasty, spanning Asia and Africa, rose above the Abbasid Caliphate and the Hashemites to establish a vast empire once again unifying the three Holy Sanctuaries. Yet the empire's collapse has become unstoppable. The aftershocks of Emperor Stefan's deeds still reverberate across Anatolia; grand crusades have been dismantled once more by the Turks. The ruler in Edirne, like an arrow released from its bow, vows to restore the glory of the §YOttoman§! Empire. The §YSerbian Empire§!, like a centipede that does not die even when cut, after betraying the Crusaders, failed to secure lasting peace. Now the Balkans are ablaze with war once more. §YThere are always problems to be solved, faith to be tested, and national identities to be forged§!. And at the heart of this Eastern Mediterranean turmoil, can the §YKnights Hospitaller§! once again perform miracles, establishing a sacred realm overseas as in the First Crusade?\n\nThe Order endures, though circumstances and faces have changed; only the motto remains unaltered: §G'Defend the Faith, Succor the Suffering.'§!"
