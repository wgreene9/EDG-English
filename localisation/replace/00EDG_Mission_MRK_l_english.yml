EDG_MRK_mission_1_2_desc:0 "In 1205, Sulayman ibn Dawud, descendant of Fatimah and Ali, the last of the Fatimid lineage, after escaping Ayyubid surveillance amidst a turbulent crowd with his loyal attendants, led a mounted force, more akin to bandits than an army, westward. Bypassing Christian-held Tunis, he arrived in the Maghreb, the land where his ancestors had laid their foundations, firmly believing in his own judgment. At that time, the Almohad Caliphate was deeply embroiled in conflicts ignited by the Zanata tribes and the Marinids, its reach to the east overstretched. Towns in Kabylia and Tlemcen each pledged allegiance to their own masters, and the governing order along the Barbary Coast was nearly shattered. Sulayman ibn Dawud of the Fatimids raised his banner. Ismaili Shias discontent with the Sunni nobility of the Almohads welcomed their Imam incarnate. From then on, the Almohad Caliphate completely lost control over the provinces of the Maghreb. But now, the power of the Fatimids has waned, lingering only in West Africa. It is time for us to bring them to an end. We will expand our territories and deliver the final blow to this crumbling dynasty."

EDG_MRK_mission_1_14_desc:0 "You are correct, but The Noble Summons is a brand-new exegesis of the Quran independently developed by the Almohad Caliphate. The scripture recounts a tale set in a region known as 'Arabia,' where those chosen by Allah are granted the authority of 'Jihad' to lead armies in battle. The protagonist of the story will assume the role of a mysterious figure called the 'Prophet,' encountering diverse companions with unique personalities and abilities during free travels.

However, the leaders of the Almohad movement chose to use the Berber language for preaching, which gained us the support of the Berber people. As our true faith spreads further, we should also elevate the status of the Berber language. We must promote the Berber language and implement Moroccanization or Berberization."

EDG_MRK_mission_2_13_title:0 "Berber Hierarchy" # Consolidate the Berber Military Hierarchy
EDG_MRK_mission_2_13_desc:0 "Traditionally, Berber forces are composed of multiple military ranks, and we maintain a strict hierarchical system. At the top are the Kharijite tribes, which include many 'honorary' or 'adopted' members from other ethnicities, such as Abd al-Mu'min himself. Following them are the Timellal, then other Masmuda tribes, and finally the Abid, the black warriors. These ranks are clearly demarcated, with higher levels possessing significantly more military privileges than lower ones. We should leverage this fine tradition, consolidating our traditional Berber military hierarchy to secure the allegiance of our military nobility."

He who takes Satan for a patron instead of Allah has indeed suffered a manifest loss. He makes promises to them and fills them with vain desires—yet Satan promises them nothing but delusion. The abode of such people is the Fire, and they will find no escape. O you unjust ones among the descendants of Fatimah, your status as a Sayyid will not save you from the judgment of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Allah has power over all things. The wrongdoers shall have no helpers. Every time their skins are burned, We will replace them with new skins so that they may taste the torment. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, Allah will admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. In them, they will have pure spouses, and We will admit them into an eternal shade.’"

The century of Songhai civilization represents the glorious pinnacle of ancient Black African civilization, earning the Songhai Empire renown throughout the Islamic world. From the fifteenth century onward, Songhai gradually formed a powerful empire, supplanting the Mali Empire's hegemonic position in West Sudan. It ultimately developed into the largest ancient civilization in African history, with an area nearly equal to that of Europe. In the subsequent West Sudan region and even sub-Saharan Africa, no comparable vast empire ever emerged again. Moreover, the completeness of the Songhai Empire's political and legal systems and the flourishing of its culture and scholarship were unprecedented and remain unmatched in the pre-modern history of sub-Saharan Africa. Yet their achievements are but a stepping stone prepared for us in the long river of history."

EDG_MRK_mission_4_1_title:0 "The Land of the Almohads"
EDG_MRK_mission_4_1_desc:0 "The fates of Iberia and the Maghreb hang by the same thread. During the centuries of the Taifa era, whenever the Christians attempted to reclaim the southern peninsula, a powerful Marrakesh dynasty stood in their way. And when the Christians laid down their arms, Iberia would gradually slip back into the pattern of the Taifa era. The Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba, the Almoravid dynasty, and the Almohad Caliphate—all fell victim to this pattern. Since the dawn of the thirteenth century, the Mediterranean coast has been aflame with turmoil. Scattered uprisings have progressively stripped the empire of its flesh and blood. In 1203, Tunisia fell; in 1205, Kabylia and the entire coast of Algiers defected to the last scion of the Fatimid family, while the Marinid dynasty of the Zanata tribe seized northern Morocco from our grasp. Today, the Almohad Caliphate's controlled area has shrunk to the vicinity of Marrakesh, yet we still have the opportunity to rise once more."

EDG_MRK_mission_4_3_title:0 "Almohadism"
EDG_MRK_mission_4_3_desc:0 "The Almohad Caliphate originated from the missionary movement of Ibn Tumart. Ibn Tumart was a Masmuda Berber and an Islamic fundamentalist. In his early years, he studied in Baghdad, where he was influenced by the teachings of al-Ghazali. He also studied under the Ash'ari and Mu'tazila schools, gradually forming his own religious doctrines—a blend of Ash'ari and Sufi concepts, classifiable as belonging to the Zahiri school. The core of Ibn Tumart's religious doctrine was an extreme emphasis on Tawhid (monotheism), asserting that Allah possesses only one attribute and that other attributes risked polytheistic implications, contradicting Tawhid. He advocated for predestination, supported Sharia law, and opposed anthropomorphism. Ibn Tumart rejected the Maliki doctrine of the Almoravid dynasty, criticizing its over-reliance on later juristic consensus (ijma') while neglecting the Sunnah and Hadith. He considered the jurisprudential reasoning of Maliki jurists illegitimate and potentially heretical. Ibn Tumart attributed the decadent practices of the Maghrebis to Almoravid rule, such as the public sale of wine and pork—acts prohibited by the Quran or opposed by him. He also opposed religious art. Ibn Tumart's followers called themselves 'al-Muwahhidun' (the Monotheists). His ideology can be summarized as 'a complex syncretic Islamic sect combining Hadith scholarship, Zahiri and Shafi'i jurisprudence, al-Ghazali's social conduct, and the Shiite concepts of Imam and Mahdi.' It gradually moved away from mysticism, placing greater emphasis on logical and rational academic methods to expound its theological positions, especially in the era following Caliph al-Mansur."

EDG_MRK_mission_4_7_desc:0 "While the northern Christian kings were mired in internal strife, and as the Marinid dynasty stubbornly resisted in northern Morocco, the Almohad Caliphate, embroiled in civil conflict, saw its influence increasingly confined to the outskirts of Marrakesh. The hereditary governors initially appointed to rule the Iberian territories raced to declare independence one after another. Once again, African hegemony over Iberia crumbled into dust. Although the governors had once signed a mutual defense pact vowing 'never to war against each other,' the force of sprouting seeds of discord could not be constrained by mere words on paper. Iberia once again entered an era of warring states. In the eyes of later historians, the first half of the 13th and 14th centuries became known as the 'Third Taifa Period.' Throughout this century and a half, border conflicts between Christians and Muslims never truly ceased. The most significant among these was a large-scale assault on Lisbon launched by the King of Portugal and the King of Asturias, but due to overextension, they were ambushed by Muslims south of Coimbra, ultimately ending in failure. However, as the Cathar forces steadily consolidated and grew in strength in southern France, and Catholic nations grew increasingly weary of the concept of crusades, the lands south of the Pyrenees gradually became a relatively independent 'small world,' separate from the Catholic sphere. Although external interference occurred from time to time, it ultimately failed to alter the strategic stalemate between the two sides. Yet, when King Ignacio III of Asturias launched a crusade against Tulaytulah (Toledo), the flames of conflict in Iberia were reignited once more."

This Arab historian, in his own extravagant way, described the empress in his eyes, the magnificent Córdoba... Córdoba's architecture is grand and majestic; its people live elegantly, cultured and refined; its nobles live with exquisite taste. As another Arab writer wrote: 'Córdoba was originally a fortress city, encircled by towering stone walls, its streets beautiful and neat. In ancient times, it housed many infidel kings and worshippers, yet today its people are renowned throughout the world for their courtesy, graceful manners, outstanding talents, and refined cuisine. Besides skilled riders of fine steeds, they boast many scholars versed in all branches of knowledge. The nobility are famed for their virtue and generosity; warriors possess proficient military skills for expeditions abroad; commanders are adept at handling all forms of warfare.

EDG_MRK_mission_4_12_desc:0 "The Sahada dynasty originally was a minor power in the Yemen region. In 1342, the capable and warlike Nasir I succeeded as the Malik of the Sahada dynasty. Although Nasir I was only 22 years old at the time, his bravery, military prowess, and talent for recognizing able individuals were already renowned. Nasir unified the Yemen region by 1356 and gradually launched conquests of surrounding areas. He entered the power struggles of the Arabian Peninsula, filling the local power vacuum. The rule of the Sahada dynasty was very loose, with various regions retaining considerable autonomy, which also facilitated the dynasty's rapid expansion. By 1374, Nasir I had become a regional power in Arabia, controlling nearly half of the Arabian Peninsula's territory.\n\nIn 1380, Hajji II, the last Bahri Sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate, was expelled from Cairo, but the Burji line failed to quickly stabilize the situation, triggering a Mamluk civil war. Both sides engaged in fierce conflict, causing significant damage to the Egyptian economy. The Bahri Sultan Hajji II sought aid from the Sahada dynasty, promising to cede territories in southwestern Arabia to the Grand Malik Nasir I and offer substantial annual tribute. After careful consideration, the 60-year-old Nasir I realized this was the best birthday gift bestowed upon him by Allah. Thus, he led his army into Egypt. However, after helping the Bahri Sultan suppress the rebellion, Nasir I turned his forces against the Bahri regime, ultimately overthrowing the Mamluks and becoming the Sultan of Egypt, establishing a powerful polity spanning Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula once more in the world.\n\nYet, the Sahada dynasty's regime was highly unstable. Though seemingly at its peak on the surface, it was in fact precarious. Within the empire, the power of various military nobles remained immense; for instance, the Emirs of the Syrian region held substantial autonomous authority, and many Arabian tribes continuously sought independence. Since the death of Nasir I in 1391, the Sahada dynasty faced continuous rebellions and turmoil. The Sahada Sultan at this time was the equally astute Muhammad I. Muhammad I was the fourth and only surviving son of Nasir I. Gifted from a young age and having long accompanied his father in campaigns and state affairs, he possessed the ability to manage the crises facing the Sahada dynasty, preventing the already moribund empire from collapsing under its own weight. Under Muhammad I's governance, although the Sahada Empire remained somewhat turbulent, Egypt's economy and culture continued to flourish. Since the Sahada dynasty adhered to Shia Islam while most Muslims in its ruled territories followed Sunni Islam, the dynasty was compelled to adopt a policy of religious tolerance. Precisely due to this open and inclusive atmosphere during the Sahada period, the capital, Fayyum, became one of the academic centers of the Islamic world. Islamic scholars from the Maghreb and Persia came to lecture and exchange ideas in local mosques, contributing to significant cultural development in Egypt. However, after Muhammad's death, the Sahada Empire under his successor, Safar I, appeared unsustainable."

EDG_MRK_mission_4_20_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Kongo was finally discovered during the Age of Exploration. This land remains underdeveloped but is rich in resources. The Mahdi should bring this uncultivated, fertile land under his command."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_2_desc:0 "Marrakesh, also transliterated as Marrakech, is located in southwestern Morocco at the foot of the Atlas Mountains that traverse the country. It is known as the 'Pearl of the South.' 'Marrakesh' is a Berber word meaning 'Land of God.' For centuries, Marrakesh has been famous for its Seven Saints. During the reign of Ismail Ibn Sharif, when Sufism became widespread in Islam, the Sufi writer Abu Ali al-Hassan al-Yusi, at the Sultan's request, established the festival of the Seven Saints. The mausoleums of several renowned figures were relocated to Marrakesh to attract pilgrims, who came from as far as the port of Essaouira, bringing their own customs and festivals with them."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_3_desc:0 "The Golden House is the splendid treasury established by the Caliph. It has always been a symbol of the Caliph's power and wealth. Establishing a Privy Council here, comprised of senior state officials responsible solely to the monarch, will enhance our nation's governance capabilities."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_4_desc:0 "Mu'min divided the empire into several governorates, proclaimed himself Caliph, and established the principle of dynastic succession. The governorate system he established is our local administrative framework, but it is antiquated and filled with outdated feudal elements. As a modernizing state, we need to improve this institution."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_6_title:0 "Administrative Reforms" # Modern Administrative Reforms
EDG_MRK_mission_5_6_desc:0 "The old system continually exposes its flaws; it is bloated and cumbersome, failing to represent the interests of the majority within the country. Therefore, in the process of modernization, we have ultimately reformed our monarchy to better mobilize the nation's strength and elevate the standard of our administration."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_8_title:0 "Deal with the Brotherhoods" # Deal with the Southern Brotherhoods
EDG_MRK_mission_5_8_desc:0 "The Seville School of Jurisprudence is led by the Sufis. Sufi religious and philosophical thought primarily draws upon relevant verses from the Quran and Hadith, incorporating theories and rituals from Neoplatonism and other religious mysticism to form its ideological system. There is a clear conflict between Sufism and our doctrinal orthodoxy, yet we can still utilize their resources."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_10_desc:0 "'El Cantar de Mio Cid' not only holds an extremely important place in the history of Spanish literature but is also an unignorable work from a world literature perspective. Christians revere El Cid as a hero and invoke his name to inspire holy war. However, through the Principality of Barcelona, we will personally put an end to this absurd farce, concluding the legacy of El Cid with our own hands."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_11_desc:0 "The Sahada Empire has two heads. One head is the spiritual capital, the old Sahada capital of the Sahada dynasty, said to be the city where Shem, son of Noah, resided, where the empire's glorious past is enshrined. The other head is the practical head, with the Nile as its artery. Between these two heads, a narrow, elongated path connects them to the entity known as the imperial body. This path is both the trade route along the Red Sea coast and a road linking Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem—the three holy cities representing the Prophet's life—symbolizing the empire's prosperity and power. But soon, all of this will cease to exist."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_13_title:0 "City of Peace and Legacy"

EDG_MRK_mission_5_13_desc:0 "Jerusalem holds profound significance in Islam as well. According to Islamic tradition, the Prophet Muhammad journeyed by night from Mecca to Jerusalem and then ascended to heaven to converse with God. This event, known as the 'Isra and Mi'raj,' holds an important place in Islam. The Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Temple Mount became focal points for Muslim pilgrimage, attracting believers for prayer and religious rites. Jerusalem's Islamic relics, mosques, and urban districts all bear witness to the history and development of Islam here. The tradition of Muslim pilgrimage to Jerusalem dates back to early times, with the Al-Aqsa Mosque becoming one of their destinations for worship. Islam's emphasis on Jerusalem is also reflected in the city's geographical and religious layout. Jerusalem's mosques, palaces, and other structures have become representatives of Islamic architecture and art, carrying forward the essence of Islamic culture."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_17_title:0 "Expedition into the Sahara"
EDG_MRK_mission_5_17_desc:0 "'Sahara' is a transliteration from Arabic, where 'Sahara' means 'great desert.' It originates from the language of the local nomadic Tuareg people, originally signifying 'the great wilderness.' The migrations of nomads facilitated their involvement in trade across the entire Sahara Desert. The inhabitants of oases in the Sahara Desert were vulnerable to raids by the Sanhaja (a Berber group) and other camel-riding nomads, many of whom had entered the desert fleeing the chaos and warfare at the end of Roman rule in North Africa. Between the 7th and 11th centuries, the expansion of Islam into North Africa spurred more Berbers and Arab groups eager to maintain their traditional beliefs to migrate into the Sahara Desert. Islam ultimately expanded through trade routes, becoming the dominant social and religious force in the desert."

EDG_MRK_mission_5_19_desc:0 "In West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, the Mali Empire was once the hegemonic power of the region, stretching from the Atlantic coast across the Niger River basin all the way to the Hausa states. Its fame spread northward following the famous pilgrimage to Mecca by its ruler Mansa Musa. However, internal conflicts weakened and fragmented the once-mighty empire, placing its very survival in jeopardy."
