EDG_flavor_MAM.1.title:0 "Mamluk Request to Purchase Slaves"
EDG_flavor_MAM.1.desc:0 "In many regions of our country, there exists a significant number of unemployed vagrants and criminals. Upon learning of this, the Mamluks hope we can abduct and sell these people to them, delivering them to the Mamluks in exchange for enormous profits."
EDG_flavor_MAM.1.aa:0 "Very well, very well."
EDG_flavor_MAM.1.bb:0 "Dame desu, this is too barbaric."

EDG_flavor_MAM.2.title:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees to Sell Slaves"
EDG_flavor_MAM.2.desc:0 "After our lengthy negotiations and haggling, they have finally agreed to sell the slaves to us. Congratulations are in order, congratulations!"
EDG_flavor_MAM.2.aa:0 "Wouldn't it have been easier to agree sooner?"

EDG_flavor_MAM.3.title:0 "Compromise with the Mamluks"
EDG_flavor_MAM.3.desc:0 "Ever since the Sahada dynasty arrived in Egypt from Yemen, the conflict between the local Mamluks and the Yemeni nobility has never ceased. Now, after the long years since the reign of an-Nasir I, the contradictions between the Yemeni nobles and the native Mamluks have gradually become irreconcilable. Until one day, a considerable group of armed men entered Faiyum, demanding the Grand Malik grant them greater autonomy. Or even... outright independence."
EDG_flavor_MAM.3.aa:0 "We shall follow the Burji family!"
EDG_flavor_MAM.3.bb:0 "The Bahri family of Alexandria might be a good choice."
EDG_flavor_MAM.3.cc:0 "Let them go, alas."

EDG_flavor_MAM.4.title:0 "The Struggle Between the Turks and Egypt"
EDG_flavor_MAM.4.desc:0 "Since the 14th century, the Mamluks have always been the most powerful force in Egypt. Their control over the transit points of Eastern trade and the fertile Nile Delta has enabled the region to rival other great powers in the world.\n\nHowever, nothing in this world remains constant. The Ottomans, the foremost among the Turks from the north, have risen from the ashes to become a new colossus. Even once fragmented, they have risen again, preserving their strength. Now, they have shattered all of Anatolia and the Balkans, and harbor the ambition to re-establish an empire spanning three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nOn an unremarkable day in recent years, an Ottoman envoy arrived at the palace in Cairo. After reciting the prepared missive, he stood waiting for the Sultan's reply. While the exact content is currently unknown to us, the flushed faces of the court officials give a fair indication of the nature of the document. When the envoy finished his trembling recitation, all looked up at the man seated on the throne. What must he be thinking at this moment?"
EDG_flavor_MAM.4.aa:0 "If the Padishah does not disdain me, I am willing to acknowledge him as my foster father."
EDG_flavor_MAM.4.bb:0 "Bring the Ottoman envoy to me at once! I will make him kneel beneath the Banner of the Golden Crescent!"

EDG_flavor_MAM.5.title:0 "Crescent or Cross?"
EDG_flavor_MAM.5.desc:0 "Since the 14th century, the Iberian region has been mired in constant chaos and war. Both its economy and society have long been torn apart by endless disputes and swords. From Asturias to Granada, from Porto to Barcelona, it presents a scene of burgeoning vitality and fierce competition. Yet, all this will end beneath our blades—and under our Sharia. So the question arises: how shall we deal with this land and its people? Judging by the centuries of conflict here, resolving issues of religious and cultural differences will likely be no easy task..."
EDG_flavor_MAM.5.aa:0 "Let us protect the people of the White Phoenix alone."
EDG_flavor_MAM.5.bb:0 "Cluck, cluck, white chicken! Let's treat everyone equally."

EDG_flavor_MAM.6.title:0 "Beyond the Sands"
EDG_flavor_MAM.6.desc:0 "The sun sets in the west, yellow sands roll, and the tips of the pyramids cast long shadows upon the ground.\n\nThe howling sandstorm sweeps in like a heavy sigh from history, relentlessly beating against these ancient and mysterious structures. In the distance, the sound of camel bells gradually approaches, a signal of a merchant caravan traversing the vast sea of sand. The weary figures of the camel drivers appear increasingly frail in the fading light, their gaze fixed on the direction of the pyramids, eyes filled with confusion and fear of an unknown fate. What has changed from the Ayyubids to the Mamluks? The faith of the past and the faith of the present intertwine here, merely another historical Möbius strip.\n\nAnd yet, despite this, you have succeeded in transforming the Mamluks from a nation that initially did not exist on the map into one of the world's foremost great powers. Although history is forever an ascending spiral, the lamentable and admirable people will always stain the thin pages of a book with their flesh, blood, and souls, even if that was never their intent."
EDG_flavor_MAM.6.aa:0 "And the swords of the old world lie hidden in the sands, only to be refracted into new brilliance years later by the blood-like rays of the setting sun."
EDG_flavor_MAM.6.tt:0 "The Mamluk conquest content concludes here. Thank you for your playthrough and appreciation.\n\nSpecial thanks to Xiao Lanlan and the fellow group members for their encouragement and assistance. Their recognition is my greatest motivation. Wishing you, who have played to this point, a pleasant life!"

EDG_flavor_MAM.7.title:0 "The Nile's Lingering Resonance"
EDG_flavor_MAM.7.desc:0 "Listen to the rolling waves, touch the still waters with your hand. No one would think these are phenomena of the same river. Upstream on this lifegiving current, the silt carried by the impact nourishes the people of Abyssinia. The tranquility downstream provides an everlasting granary.\n\nThe Grand Malik walks to the riverbank, idly scoops a handful of water with his hand, then opens his fingers wide, letting it flow away. After doing this, he looks up towards the distant lands the river traverses. 'How much longer can she flow?' the Grand Malik ponders, but then shakes his head. He shouldn't dwell on such trivial questions; he should go to the capital now to distribute the spoils of war among the Mamluks.\n\nHe then mounts his horse and rides towards the city, while the Nile continues to flow, unchanged by anyone's path. Perhaps the sole reason for her existence in this world is to quietly observe the changes of the ages, or to let people know—the moon too has shed long tears for the joys and sorrows, meetings and partings of mortals."
EDG_flavor_MAM.7.aa:0 "'Clouds in the sky resemble white robes, in a moment they change like grey hounds...'"

EDG_flavor_MAM.8.title:0 "One Leader, One World"
EDG_flavor_MAM.8.desc:0 "An ordinary day in the city of Mecca.\n\nCountless faithful walk past the Kaaba, and without exception, kneel down to seek Allah's guidance. This is the perfect opportunity for the Malik, disguised, to observe the faith of the people.\n\n'I heard that Grand Malik is to be crowned the new Caliph, claiming he can eradicate all heresies?' says a Persian merchant dressed in luxurious silk. 'That's enough talk. The Qarmatians and Alawites are all stirring up trouble,' replies an old man in military uniform, puffing on his pipe and blowing smoke rings, his face filled with irritation.\n\nTime silently slips away amidst waiting and unease. Just as the setting sun dyes the walls of the Kaaba red, the first crescent moon quietly rises. Under the magic of the sun and moon's rotation, flames simultaneously ignite atop 72 minarets. The Grand Malik then steps onto the marble platform. When he removes his disguise, the entire crowd erupts. Raising his head, the Grand Malik utters a brief yet earth-shattering phrase:\n\n'From this day forth, there are no more heretics, no more apostates. Instead, each of us has our own faith.' After a moment of shock, waves of shouts instantly surge from the crowd. The people chant in unison, 'Long live!' So, how does our Grand Malik react? The answer is he is already too overwhelmed with tension to hear anything, merely trembling as he descends the marble platform, letting the waves of sound propagate step by step.\n\nBy now, night has completely fallen, the lingering light of the crescent moon nearly vanished. But the people seem to have found a better pursuit and a clearer basis for faith. Yet... is all this truly worth it?"
EDG_flavor_MAM.8.aa:0 "I have already ended heresy; only the moon is more lucid than I."
