EDG_flavorKNI_mission.20.t:0 "A Flickering Candle in the Storm"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.20.d:0 "Since the Order arrived on Rhodes, it has been constantly struggling against the Levantine states. Ayyubids, Mamluks, Shahada, Ottomans—the Knights have been resisting the maritime forces of the Muslim world in the Aegean, with no time to spare for lands beyond Rhodes. Since Grand Master Jean de Lastic assumed power, he has consistently fortified the defenses of Rhodes to withstand severe trials. However, the rising Ottoman states and the powerful Shahada to the south have placed increasing pressure on the Order. The European chapters are overstretched, and various Christian monarchs are preoccupied with their own affairs. The bloodshed along the Aegean coast has not ceased, and the Order is like a flickering candle on a fishing boat in this storm, easily at risk of perishing here.\n\nLastic is old, and in the face of the Order's crisis, the aged Grand Master seems powerless. "I shall not live to see the Holy Land," the Grand Master said to the young knights of the Order, "but before I return to the embrace of the Lord, there is one more thing...""
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.20.a:0 "The bells of dawn have rung, I shall illuminate the final night sky"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.1.t:0 "The Order's Request"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.1.d:0 "The Knights Hospitaller have requested to purchase the island of Crete from us, offering a handsome price."

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.1.b:0 "In your dreams"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.2.t:0 "Donate the Island"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.2.d:0 "The Pope has proposed that if we are willing to donate the island of Crete to the Knights Hospitaller, he will lift our excommunication."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.2.a:0 "O Lord, I am willing!"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.2.b:0 "Just because of that old man?"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.3.t:0 "Patriarchs of the East"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.3.d:0 "Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, and Rome were the original patriarchates. Under our governance, the ancient eastern sees are thriving, and the glory of God has once again descended upon the Levant. The patriarchs of these four great sees have gradually broken free from the Pope's influence and come under our direct control, while our influence with the Pope has grown daily. Today, the four great eastern patriarchates have achieved a splendor not even seen during the Roman era."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.3.a:0 "Thriving"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.4.t:0 "Lift the Ban on Tournaments"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.4.d:0 "The statutes of the Knights Hospitaller do not favor knightly tournaments, but under the tide of secularization, this rule will be abolished. Each Grand Master may host a nationwide knightly tournament once during their term, with generous prizes attracting knights from within the country and even abroad. Of course, our Grand Master must also participate."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.4.a:0 "The ban is lifted"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.5.t:0 "Nation of Glory"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.5.d:0 "In battles against the infidels, we are battle-hardened and invincible. Members of the Order are spread throughout the no-longer-mysterious eastern Mediterranean. We will fight the infidels in the deserts, in the mountains, and on the plains, until the glory of God spreads across the world and lost souls are saved."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.5.a:0 "We are the light of Catholicism!"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.6.t:0 "Fortifying the Citadel of Aleppo"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.6.d:0 "Holding only the coast leaves us with no retreat, while advancing inland risks being surrounded by Muslims. After capturing this ancient fortress, we began establishing a zone of control here, alongside the "Krak des Chevaliers" we built in Homs. Now, our construction efforts have borne significant results."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.6.a:0 "We are masters of building fortifications"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.7.t:0 "United We Stand"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.7.d:0 "The increasingly powerful Knights Hospitaller have demanded that we hand over command, claiming it will better facilitate crusading activities. Faced with their demand, we must make a choice."

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.7.b:0 "You don't understand warfare at all"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.8.t:0 "Ethnic Fusion"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.8.d:0 "During the days when the Order lacked territory, our knights came from all over Europe, while the lives of the local infidels were scarcely interfered with by us. Differences in language and customs troubled us, and our control over the land was not strong. After the great calamity, now that we possess vast lands in the Levant, we can no longer remain passive. We will no longer restrict the admission of local converts to the Catholic faith. The infusion of new blood has greatly altered the Order's current state, giving birth to something new through cultural collision."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.8.a:0 "We are wanderers from overseas, and we are Levantines"
EDG_OutremerFrank:0 "Frankish Outremer"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.10.t:0 "The Kaaba for All"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.10.d:0 "The Kaaba in Mecca is undoubtedly the center of the Islamic world. But now, this mosque will no longer belong to Muslims. We have partially demolished this mosque and constructed an academic center of the same name to enhance our prestige. Stampedes may no longer occur here, but it will certainly become an outstanding academic hub. It will be more open and more prosperous!"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.10.a:0 "Pork can be served here now"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.11.t:0 "The Sacred Flame Rekindled"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.11.d:0 "After years of warfare, the Great Lighthouse of Alexandria had fallen into disrepair. This lighthouse is crucial to our trade. Rekindling the sacred flame of the lighthouse is an urgent task. Through diligent labor, our efforts have proven highly effective."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.11.a:0 "The lighthouse shines again"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.12.t:0 "Canal Construction Begins"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.12.d:0 "After relentless efforts by the Order's engineers and scholars, we have developed a feasible plan to successfully connect the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. A golden waterway now appears in the world. The completion of this great undertaking will be hailed as a miracle."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.12.a:0 "This is a miracle!"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.13.t:0 "Rebuilding the Tower of Babel"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.13.d:0 "For many years, the eastern shore of the Mediterranean has been united under the glory of God. Fellow believers respect us, heretics and infidels fear us, and we shall bring true peace, not suffering. Against this backdrop, the ethnic integration of the Levant organized by the Order has proceeded smoothly, and the ideology of the "Tower of Babel Salvation Society" has gained acceptance. While many challenges may remain, our nation has truly become a land of peace, a land of faith, a multi-ethnic power, and a harmonious utopia.\n\nThe constant hum of machinery, the pungent smell of smoke, ash and soot obscuring vision—these are signs of a changing era. The allure of scientific and cultural progress is the driving force that propels us ever forward. Now, our challenge is to maintain the delicate balance between earth and humanity, peace and war.\n\nOn Earth, the Tower of Babel was not permitted by God; an angry God confounded human language, and unity was lost. But building this tower with faith in our hearts carries no blasphemy. The Order has achieved this. Fear not, for the tower shall reach Heaven!"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.13.a:0 "The tower shall reach Heaven!"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.14.t:0 "No Other Choice"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.14.d:0 "Whether it be the Ottomans or the Bulgarians, the outcome of the Balkan powers' struggle is about to be revealed, but both sides will, without exception, be enemies of the Crusade. We must become strong enough to halt the incursions of these mobs, and securing the essential foothold for defending the Holy Land is particularly crucial. To the north lie the remnants of the Balkan Crusaders. Having endured betrayal and slaughter, they are now deeply suspicious and unwilling to trust us. To muster the strength of the Crusade, they now face conflict with their own kin."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.14.a:0 "Let us fight; time is running short"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.14.b:0 "Better to let it be"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.15.t:0 "The Crusaders' Constantinople"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.15.d:0 "The Latin Empire, established by the Fourth Crusade, claims the legacy of the declining Byzantine Empire. Now, after its conquest by [Root.GetName], this place is once again under Catholic rule. [Root.Monarch.GetName] declares that [Root.GetName] will become a model for all Crusaders, sworn to defend Constantinople for God and the Pope."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.15.a:0 "Constantinople shall regain its glory"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.16.t:0 "An Invitation to Return to the Holy Land"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.16.d:0 "We have received a letter from the Knights Hospitaller. The Grand Master hopes we will join them in facing their difficulties. He claims that Janus, who has joined the Order, shows great potential. If we agree to cede control of the lands and soldiers of Cyprus, we can enjoy privileges, and Janus could become a Commander. As the head of the family, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must make a choice."

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.17.t:0 "An Anatolian Bridgehead"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.17.d:0 "The Ottomans seized Smyrna in the midst of chaos, and Greek refugees now hold it. Loyal to their ideal of restoring Greece, they refuse to return the Order's port. However, the Order urgently needs a foothold in Anatolia, and we have re-evaluated our strategic plans for Smyrna."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.17.a:0 "Thieves must be punished"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.18.t:0 "For Our Shared Home"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.18.d:0 "On the eastern shore of the Mediterranean lies our home, a land of vast expanse, passionate people, and devout faith.\n\nKnights resist the invasions of infidels, clergy guide the lost, and seekers of springs sail toward distant dreams. Everyone strives for this land overseas, for our shared home."
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.18.a:0 "We are builders of peace"

EDG_flavorKNI_mission.19.t:0 "Our Nation"
EDG_flavorKNI_mission.19.d:0 "No secular ruler can become the King of Jerusalem—we have learned this lesson well. Our federation is an assembly of Crusader forces in the Holy Land. Its ruler concurrently serves as the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, holding no secular royal title, nor even that of a bishop. 'The Holy Outremer Federation'—this is the new name for our land, so new it feels unfamiliar. Heaven knows where those in charge dug up such a name, yet beneath this unfamiliar title, the people bustling about are all familiar faces.\n\nThe Knights Hospitaller remain the leaders of this nation, the ideology of the Tower of Babel Salvation Society remains unchanged, and citizens still go about their lives striving for their livelihoods. It seems as if nothing has changed at all.\n\nThe Grand Master says, 'A new name represents a new birth.' Beside him flies our banner: the white-backed Jerusalem flag, symbol of the Federation, with the distinctive swallow-tailed cross of the Knights Hospitaller standing out prominently, intertwined with various war banners—this is the composition of the Federation. This land needs redemption. Crusaders gather here; this is the newborn nation of the Crusade."

EDG_KNI_hajimi.1.d:0 "Following an unprecedented great victory, what greeted the Order was not the glory of God, but endless desolation.\n\nNow that the Holy Land has been fully reclaimed, few remain in this place that is holy but possesses little else. They take soil from here back to Europe, as proof that they came.\n\nThough the Order treats all equally in matters of healing, a significant divide still exists with the local populace. Changing faith is not the work of a single day. Moreover, the Order's manpower is insufficient amid the ebbing tide after the victory. Among the new recruits joining the Order, idealists are gradually dwindling. Some members seek only food and shelter, let alone the mercenaries who work solely for pay. The handful who remain are clearly inadequate to control this land; indeed, the Order's grip here diminishes with each passing day.\n\n"The Levant, eight hundred miles, once the fertile land of Outremer. Suddenly, banditry arises from nothing, miasma obscures human traces..." A wandering bard from who knows where sings a meaningless song in the empty Holy City. Bandits run rampant, yellow sand fills the sky, and all that meets the eye in the sacred land is endless desolation. You who come from overseas, pause for a moment. If you still remember your oath, then reclaim §Tthe virtues upon the swallow-tailed cross§!, and save this land from its suffering."

EDG_KNI_hajimi.2.t:0 "How Can We Stagnate?"
EDG_KNI_hajimi.2.d:0 "Loyalty, piety, honesty, courage, honor, fearlessness of death, extending aid to the poor and sick, and reverence for the Church. These are the eight virtues represented by the swallow-tailed cross, and the Order's pursuit beyond its sworn vows. Through the tireless efforts of the Order and the Salvation Society, this nationwide turmoil was promptly quelled, and production restored. Yet the threat from the infidels remains."

This time, God will not stop us, and we will prevent turmoil from tearing this land apart.\n\nThe Tower of Babel Salvation Society was founded by members of the Order who remained in the Holy Land. Its members span all ethnicities and classes within the nation. Its purpose is to halt this great turmoil and achieve religious peace within the country. Its primary work involves the construction of Jerusalem, including education, healthcare, and other fields."
