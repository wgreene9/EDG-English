EDG_AVE_mission_1_25_desc:0 "The Normans have held sway in Southern Italy for over 300 years, yet their successors have failed to fulfill Roger's Dream; Italia's ambitions have dissipated amidst suspicion and discord. Let us aid these unworthy descendants in ending the pointless strife. Under the protection of the Plantagenet dynasty, they shall advance towards a broader future."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_27_title:0 "Anglo-Norman Friendship"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_27_desc:0 "Though we have adopted the name Frangleterre, Norman culture remains an integral part of our national spirit.

EDG_AVE_mission_1_29_title:0 "Dealing with the Republic"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_29_desc:0 "Theodore deposed Isaakios V and established a precarious military junta on the empire's frontier, vainly attempting to preserve this colony filled with desperate Greeks. Let us shatter the Sicilians' hopes for survival and announce our Mediterranean ambitions to the world."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_30_title:0 "Heart of the Mediterranean"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_30_desc:0 "The island of Malta was once the starting point of Roger II's conquests in Southern Italy. Now, it shall become the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty's dominance over the Mediterranean. We will repair the city's defenses, open up sea routes, and make Malta a bridgehead for stepping into North Africa."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_31_title:0 "Reclaiming Crusader Soil"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_31_desc:0 "In 1221, the 'French Crusaders' defeated the Tunisian governor with superior command and high morale, seizing the spiritual center of the North African Muslim world. However, the greed for wealth and fear of the enemy among the scattered soldiers led to their gradual retreat. Yet, faithful crusaders are never alone, for the Plantagenet dynasty has once again set foot on this land; we are with them."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_33_title:0 "The Crown of Norway" # Claiming the Norwegian Crown
EDG_AVE_mission_1_33_desc:0 "The Norwegian and Scottish royal families have long been on good terms. Had Princess Margaret, the 'Maid of Norway,' not died young, northern influence might well have penetrated deep into Britain's north. Now that we have tamed the proud Red Lion, it is time to demand the crown from this weak neighbor."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_35_title:0 "Reaching the Polar Forests" # Reaching the Northern Forests
EDG_AVE_mission_1_35_desc:0 "The Sámi people have long been confused about their identity, surviving by submitting to stronger powers and paying tribute, yet deluding themselves about building a utopia in the frozen tundra and coniferous forests. As their new masters, we do not mind sharing a bit of the Plantagenet dynasty's lingering light with Lapland, hoping they awaken from their fantasies soon."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_38_title:0 "A Germanic Identity" # Attempting to Establish a Germanic Identity / Rekindle German Identity
EDG_AVE_mission_1_38_desc:0 "In the 5th century, our brave ancestors left their Saxon homeland, embarking westward on a path of conquest, eventually settling in England.

EDG_AVE_mission_1_39_desc:0 "To manage cooperation and conflict within the Empire, the Holy Roman Empire established a decentralized political order.

EDG_AVE_mission_1_44_desc:0 "The strife among Polish princes has needlessly spilled the blood of their subjects, and the vast ancestral legacy has been torn asunder in the quarrels of descendants.

EDG_AVE_mission_1_46_desc:0 "The Western Slavic peoples of the north have broken free from the Tatar yoke, emulating the ruthlessness of their former steppe masters to dominate the region.

EDG_AVE_mission_1_47_title:0 "By the Grace of the Lord" # By the True Grace of the Lord
EDG_AVE_mission_1_47_desc:0 "The Great Schism of Christianity shattered the unity of the Western world, and the fallacies of the lost have led subjects astray from the Empire's rule. Now, the betrayers have bowed in the judgment of fire. The Plantagenet dynasty shall put an end to the troubles brought by heresy. May the Lord's true grace forgive all lost lambs who return to the fold."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_48_title:0 "The Eternal Beacon"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_48_desc:0 "In 332 BC, Alexander the Great founded the Golden City on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. Since then, a beacon has guided the exchange between East and West. The Queen of the Mediterranean symbolizes not only the conqueror's glory but also the ruler's wisdom. Let us restore her prosperity."

EDG_AVE_mission_1_49_title:0 "The Nile Flows Silently"
EDG_AVE_mission_1_49_desc:0 "The regularly flooding Nile nurtured the cyclical worldview of the ancient Egyptians. The people of the land of the rising sun grew accustomed to accepting one foreign conqueror after another within this rhythm of cycles. The glory of the Plantagenet dynasty is different from that of our predecessors; our sun shall never set."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_24_title:0 "Return to Burgundy"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_24_desc:0 "Although the Capetian family defeated the Duke of Burgundy in 942, incorporating the eastern princes into the kingdom's territory, privileged appanages led by Franche-Comté frequently challenged the rule from Paris. We must shatter the privileges granted recklessly by the old dynasty to its vassals, exerting greater control to rein in the unruly knights and make them bow completely before the authority of the Plantagenet dynasty."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_25_title:0 "The Alpine Front"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_25_desc:0 "The Alps are a natural barrier separating France and Italy, but they could not stop the rampant spread of heretical beliefs. We must further fortify our defenses, making the Alpine front impregnable; then turn our swords toward the kings of Italy, letting them feel the edge of the House of Plantagenet."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_26_title:0 "The Mountains Shall Bow" # The Mountains Shall Not Hinder Us
EDG_AVE_mission_2_26_desc:0 "The Piedmontese have long hidden in the shadows of the mountains, cautiously avoiding the gaze of Rome and Milan. Now, the radiance of the Plantagenet dynasty is upon them, and the bell tolls for the judgment of heretics. Whether through voluntary submission or forced subjugation, annexing Piedmont will be our first step in Northern Italy."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_27_title:0 "Filippo's Legacy" # Reclaiming Filippo's Legacy
EDG_AVE_mission_2_27_desc:0 "The Visconti family relied on compromise to navigate skillfully in Northern Italy, securing many privileges through so-called political wisdom, yet increasingly hampering the royal court with guilds and vassals. We shall end the weak Visconti line, seize their titles and honors, inherit their lands and wealth, and let the Lombards witness what a true philosopher-king truly is."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_28_title:0 "Expelling the False Papacy"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_28_desc:0 "The shadow of the Catholic Church has loomed over Europe for too long. The popes of the false papacy have endlessly extracted wealth and launched crusades, bringing profound disaster to Italy and the entire continent. Let us proclaim ourselves the true guardians of Christianity, eliminate the greedy and short-sighted Roman nobility, and establish a new church under the protection of the Plantagenet dynasty."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_29_title:0 "A Unified Italy"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_29_desc:0 "Italy has longed to shake off the rule of barbarians, yet no ruler could end the wars. Now, the Plantagenet dynasty has arrived. What gates remain closed to us? Who would dare refuse obedience? What jealousy would oppose us? Which Italian would refuse to bow before us? We shall stand forever atop the peaks, gazing down upon the Apennines beneath our feet."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_31_title:0 "Bring Algiers to Heel"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_31_desc:0 "The pirates of Algiers are a troublesome plague upon the Mediterranean, even contributing directly to the decline of the Kingdom of Aragon. We could set them back to their old ways, plundering Mediterranean wealth for the Plantagenet dynasty; or eradicate them entirely, ensuring lasting peace along the Mediterranean coast."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_32_title:0 "Ruler of the North Sea"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_32_desc:0 "Though having lived on the British Isles for centuries, the Plantagenet dynasty's ambition to unify the North Sea has never faded. 'To be wealthy yet not return to one's homeland is like walking at night in fine robes.' Now, the port of London is crowded with masts, its ships stretching for miles. It is time for the self-important rulers of the north to feel the hegemony of Frangleterre. Let us claim all the crowns of the North Sea!"

EDG_AVE_mission_2_33_title:0 "North Atlantic Cod"
EDG_AVE_mission_2_33_desc:0 "The richest resource in the North Sea trade zone is cod. In recent years, the yield of this nutritious and delicious fish has surged. Let us vigorously develop deep-sea fisheries to promote prosperity in coastal regions."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_34_title:0 "Ending the Northern Lion" # Ending the Northern Lion's Delusion
EDG_AVE_mission_2_34_desc:0 "The self-important Karl VIII vainly sought to establish a unified Scandinavian Empire. However, Sweden's iron army was powerless against the heavenly soldiers of the Plantagenet dynasty. The thunder of the north is but a mere sneeze before our forces. The Northern Lion must either bow to the leadership of the Red Dragon or be cleansed by sacred fire."
EDG_AVE_mission_2_34_tri_tt:0 " All provinces of §YSwedish§! and §YFinnish§! culture are owned by us or our non-tributary subjects."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_36_title:0 "Sole Lord of Fennoscandia" # The Sole Lord of Scandinavia and Fennoscandia
EDG_AVE_mission_2_36_desc:0 "The bitter winds cannot topple the victor's banners; the surging waves cannot drown out the strong's authority. The Plantagenet dynasty has defeated all grudging resisters with military might and accepted all loyal vassals with tolerance. Under our rule, sea lanes are unobstructed, and northern residents live in peace and prosperity. It is time to be crowned King of the North amidst cheers."

EDG_AVE_mission_2_39_title:0 "Exploiting the Schism" # Exploiting the Empire's Religious Dilemma
EDG_AVE_mission_2_39_desc:0 "Although the Holy Roman Empire claims Catholic exclusivity, successive emperors have been powerless against heresies. Princes rebelling against the Roman Curia act like ghosts and goblins within the Empire, challenging orthodox authority. We should intervene in religious affairs to expand the Plantagenet dynasty's influence in Germany."

EDG_AVE_mission_3_28_title:0 "Extending Our Influence"
EDG_AVE_mission_3_28_desc:0 "The rule of the Capetian dynasty was not without value; their failures provide more lessons for the Plantagenet dynasty. We should occupy the richest territories, bolster population and treasury, develop production and commerce; moreover, we must expand our branches abroad, win over old vassals, and plant our lineage in newly absorbed states; most importantly, we must build an unmatched army, for only the long sword can defend the empire's glory."

EDG_AVE_mission_3_30_desc:0 "Our territory has surpassed the borders of the Western Roman Empire; our vassals are spread across the world. The Plantagenet dynasty is no longer confined to a single imperial title. Since the successors of previous kings know only clinging to remnants, let us establish a new polity—the European Community, a union of nations under the absolute control of the House of Plantagenet.

EDG_AVE_mission_3_42_desc:0 "The Magyars have always been at odds with the Holy Roman Empire; the Germans could never fully control the Hungarian nobility.

EDG_AVE_mission_3_47_desc:0 "Unlike the newly risen parvenus, the Plantagenet dynasty has deep roots in the history of Europa.
