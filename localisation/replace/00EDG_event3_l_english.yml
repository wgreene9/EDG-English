The Order was first promoted by Godfrey of Bouillon, leader of the First Crusade and ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and its early members were called 'Pioneers of the Holy Sepulchre.' In 1113, the Order was recognized by Pope Paschal II through a papal bull. Its initial members included regular canons, secular canons, and others. Later, the Order began selecting armed knights from the crusader forces—men of courage and dedication—who swore to follow the Rule of Saint Augustine with its spirit of poverty and to obey the King of Jerusalem, specifically defending the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the security of the Holy Land. After the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the power to appoint new knights became the privilege of the highest Catholic authority in the Holy Land—the Custody of the Holy Land.\n\nWith the liberation of Jerusalem, we can rightfully relocate the Order back to Jerusalem to continue its sacred mission."

Indeed, this gold fever yielded more than just the sins of greed or increased wealth; the massive influx of precious metals into Europe introduced a series of new problems.\nFor centuries prior to the 16th century, prices in Western Europe had remained relatively stable, aside from short-term fluctuations due to war or poor harvests. However, with the discovery of the Americas and the opening of new sea routes, Europeans plundered enormous amounts of gold and silver from their colonies, leading to the rapid devaluation of precious metals in Europe. Prices skyrocketed, counterfeit currency emerged, and speculation ran rampant. These developments weakened the traditional nobility and provided opportunities for the rising bourgeoisie, but also created numerous economic and social problems.\nThis price increase affected all kinds of industrial and agricultural commodities, reaching unprecedented levels and lasting for a century. Undoubtedly, this was an era filled with sin and chaos, but also one of transformation and opportunity.

After 'Tall' Stefan Lazarevic received the title of Despot from the Byzantine Empire and declared Serbia free from its vassalage to the Ottomans, Sultan 'The Thunderbolt' Bayezid I led his army to confront them. The two sides clashed decisively at Sofia in 1402. Stefan Lazarevic personally commanded, and his favorite general, Vjekoslav, also distinguished himself in the Battle of Sofia, charging at the forefront and leading the Serbian army to drive the Turks back step by step. The Battle of Sofia ended in a disastrous defeat for the Ottoman Sultanate; Bayezid I was captured in defeat and later died in prison, like his father Murad I, by Serbian hands. However, Vjekoslav's outspoken nature and his disregard for power angered certain powerful figures at court. In a political conspiracy, Vjekoslav was falsely accused of treason. Despite his loyalty to the state, Emperor Stefan John Uroš permitted his imprisonment in the dungeons, where he suffered for 20 long years. During this extended period, his heroic deeds were forgotten by the world, and his name nearly became a sad footnote in Serbian military history. Now, faced with the Bulgarian invasion, Vjekoslav pleads with the Emperor to release him so he may lead the army against the Bulgarians. However, regional factions at court adamantly refuse his return, arguing that after 20 years of imprisonment, Vjekoslav could no longer be truly loyal to the Empire and would certainly rebel.

Large tracts of Timar land were inherited indefinitely, and local governments frequently approved holders' requests for new land, disregarding this principle.

In response, Suleiman I issued a decree reaffirming that local governments only had the authority to grant small Timars, while the approval of large Timars was centralized, even to the Sultan himself. Violators of this order would face severe punishment. During the reforms, Suleiman paid special attention to the conditions of Christian peasants on Timars.

Consequently, [Root.Monarch.GetName] never favored Mustafa, instead doting on his other children with Hürrem Sultan, which greatly displeased Prince Mustafa.\n\nThroughout his tenure as crown prince, Mustafa faced severe trials. He was transferred by his father, [Root.Monarch.GetName], from his initial post as governor of Manisa to the distant province of Amasya as governor, while the governorship of Manisa was given to Prince Mehmed, born of Hürrem. In a letter, [Root.Monarch.GetName] told his son that sending Prince Mustafa to Amasya as governor was not to prevent him from becoming the heir but to defend the eastern coast of the Ottoman Empire and to allow Mustafa to learn how to govern this vast empire. However, no one, including Mustafa, believed this. Since Mustafa was the most popular candidate for the throne among the princes—even Venetian envoys described him as 'indescribably loved and expected as the heir'—this decree somewhat reassured the Ottoman army and people, reducing their dissatisfaction with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Yet it also heightened the Padishah's wariness towards Prince Mustafa. A prince beloved by the people, bureaucracy, and army could very well rebel, just as his father Selim II the Grim had done, and directly seize the imperial throne.\n\nDuring his time in Amasya, Prince Mustafa learned that his talented brother Prince Mehmed, born of Hürrem, had died of illness. Because Prince Mehmed was exceptionally capable, he was always doted on by Hürrem and [Root.Monarch.GetName], who had repeatedly considered making Mehmed the crown prince. And now, he was dead.\n\nAt this point, it seemed all obstacles between Mustafa and the throne had vanished. However, Hürrem remained determined to have her own son become crown prince, so Mustafa immediately faced new challenges. Hürrem Sultan continuously used her political influence to support her sons, making Prince Mustafa's political career extremely difficult. Nevertheless, Mustafa successfully governed Amasya for twelve years under these circumstances. Due to his outstanding performance in the campaign against the Persian Safavid Empire, [Root.Monarch.GetName] transferred Mustafa to the governorship of Konya as a reward. But now, Prince Mustafa's position was even more precarious because Hürrem Sultan and Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha formed an alliance, jointly supporting Hürrem's sons Selim and Bayezid, and began spreading rumors detrimental to Mustafa.

In other European languages, she is commonly known as Roxelana, meaning 'the Ruthenian one.' According to research by the early 17th-century Polish poet Samuel Twardowski, Roxelana was born into a Ukrainian Orthodox family near Lviv (then part of Poland). She was captured as a slave during a raid by the Crimean Khanate, sold to Istanbul, purchased by Pargali Ibrahim, and selected for the Sultan's harem.

In the end, the Magnificent Sultan was moved by her and fell completely in love with her, even agreeing to an astonishing request of hers. The Sultan was willing to take her with him into public appearances. In feudal Turkey, women were always deeply secluded within the inner chambers of the harem, strictly guarded by strong eunuchs. Soon, Roxelana bore the Sultan a son, one of the potential heirs to the throne. In her lifetime, she bore the Sultan four sons and one daughter. She always appeared joyful and carefree, so the Sultan gave her the Turkish name 'Hürrem,' meaning 'the laughing one.'\n\nHürrem was not only beautiful but also an excellent politician.

He clearly saw the Greeks as an asset to his empire, possessing talents in handicrafts, commerce, and navigation that the Turks lacked. Moreover, Mehmed greatly admired Greek scholarship. Out of concern for the Greeks, Mehmed promptly appointed a new Patriarch for the Greek Church. The previous Patriarch had fled to Italy in 1451, effectively abdicating. Mehmed's chosen candidate was the renowned scholar Gennadius Scholarius, also known as George Scholarios. Before the Siege of Constantinople began, the Greek and Roman churches had attempted to achieve union in exchange for Western Christian aid to Constantinople, and Gennadius was a leading opponent of this union. Therefore, Gennadius was unlikely to secretly collude with Western Christians. When summoned by the Sultan, Gennadius was found to have been captured from his monastery cell during the city's fall and sold as a slave to a wealthy Turk who appreciated his vast knowledge. After being ransomed, Gennadius was brought before Mehmed the Conqueror. Mehmed treated him with great courtesy, persuaded him to accept the Patriarchate, and discussed with him the systematic arrangements for governing the Orthodox community. Mehmed's arrangements, at least in principle, ensured the Orthodox self-determination in religious and some secular affairs, guaranteeing them non-interference and freedom from persecution. Upon the Sultan's recommendation, Gennadius's appointment as Patriarch was confirmed by the Holy Synod.\n\nIn January 1454, Gennadius was formally consecrated and crowned as the Greek Orthodox Patriarch; the Sultan exercised the former privilege of the Byzantine emperors by endorsing this appointment. The entire ceremony largely followed traditional forms. The Sultan personally presented the Patriarchal insignia to Gennadius—the robes, the pastoral staff, and a new silver-gilt pectoral cross (as the old one was lost). He then recited prayers over Gennadius, saying: 'May good fortune be upon the Patriarch, may our friendship last forever, and may you possess all the privileges enjoyed by Patriarchs throughout history.' Gennadius was granted jurisdiction over all Rumelian (Byzantine) Orthodox communities and was honored with the title of Three-Tailed Pasha. Additionally, in the city's Phanar district, inhabited by Greeks, Gennadius had his own civil court and prison. Since Hagia Sophia had been converted into a mosque, the consecration and coronation ceremonies were held at the Church of the Holy Apostles. Mehmed specifically ordered that this church be preserved intact for use as the Patriarchal cathedral. After receiving a generous monetary gift from the Sultan, the newly appointed Patriarch paraded through the streets on a fine white horse (also a gift from the Sultan) and then settled near the Church of the Holy Apostles."

According to folklore, Sokollu was not taken randomly from his home but was specifically chosen by Yesilce Mehmed Bey due to his reputation for exceptional talent. This story also claims that Sokollu's uncle attempted to bring his nephew back from the Ottoman authorities but ultimately failed.\n\nFirst given the name Mehmed, he received a thorough Ottoman education in Edirne and Istanbul, then trained at the Enderun School within the Topkapi Palace as an apprentice Janissary. In 1535, Sokollu was assigned as an assistant to the Treasurer, Iskender Çelebi. After Iskender Çelebi's death, Sokollu returned to Istanbul. Besides Turkish, Sokollu spoke Serbian, Persian, Arabic, Italian, and Latin.\n\nSokollu became a commander in the Sultan's guard in 1543, which allowed him close access to Suleiman I and learn from him. As a soldier, Sokollu distinguished himself in the First Battle of Mohács and the Siege of Vienna. In 1546, after the death of Kapudan Pasha Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha, Sokollu succeeded him as Kapudan Pasha. During his five years in this role, he launched maritime expeditions to Tripoli and significantly strengthened the naval fleet's arsenal. Due to his outstanding performance, Suleiman appointed him Third Vizier in 1555, securing him a seat in the Divan (Imperial Council).

He was taken to Istanbul as a child, where he received excellent military and bureaucratic training. In 1526, Rüstem participated in the Battle of Mohács as a cavalryman and gradually rose to high-ranking imperial offices over the following years. Most historical sources describe Rüstem as a rational and composed man, possessing keen intelligence, always maintaining a cool head, and utterly loyal to the Sultan. As Grand Vizier, Rüstem amassed enormous wealth. He was the first Grand Vizier in Ottoman history to use his private fortune to fund imperial development. Rüstem worked hard to address the Ottoman Empire's financial difficulties caused by massive war expenditures and the court's lavish lifestyle. He generously used his own funds to construct bridges, roads, markets, granaries, baths, shelters, caravanserais, monasteries, schools, and various public welfare institutions. He also established new trade centers, such as the bazaar in Sarajevo and silk factories in Bursa and Istanbul. Rüstim developed the empire's economy by encouraging large-scale public works projects and built water supply systems in Istanbul, Mecca, and Jerusalem. Rüstem also found sufficient funds in the treasury for Suleiman I to construct the magnificent Süleymaniye Mosque and supported the legendary architect Mimar Sinan in completing other architectural works.

These Muslims, carrying their faith, culture, and way of life, embarked on the journey to Rome.\n\nWith the continuous influx of Muslim population, the streets and alleys of Rome underwent earth-shaking changes. The once-magnificent Christian churches were gradually converted, some into mosques, with minarets rising into the city's skyline. The call to prayer, sounding at regular intervals each day, replaced the former church bells, echoing over Rome. In the markets, Muslim merchants brought precious goods from the East like spices and silk, trading with local residents, fostering cultural exchange and collision. In schools, alongside traditional knowledge, Islamic teachings became an important part of the curriculum. More and more Romans began to encounter and understand Islam, attracted by its profound doctrines and unique culture. Slowly, Islam took root and flourished in Rome, becoming the city's mainstream faith.

A great tree grew from the center of his body, its vibrant branches extending larger and larger until they covered the heavens and the earth. Beneath the tree were four great mountains, which Osman recognized as the Caucasus, Atlas, Taurus, and Balkan ranges. These four great mountains supported this sacred tree, at the very center of the world. From the tree's roots flowed four rivers: the Tigris, Euphrates, Danube, and Nile. Osman saw ships coming and going on the rivers, heard the clamor of domestic animals, fields full of harvest, hillsides covered with forests, springs and streams murmuring through cypress trees and rose bushes. His homeland shone with magnificent towns, majestic domes and turrets, pyramids and obelisks, minarets and towers. The crescent moon rose, its light illuminating the tower spires; he heard the beginning of the night prayer. The call to prayer blended with the sweet song of nightingales, echoed by parrots, and all the singing birds.'\n\n'Suddenly, the birds fled swiftly through the gaps in the intertwined branches; all the leaves on the tree turned into scimitars. A fierce gale arose, a violent wind carrying the blade-like leaves sweeping across the world towards Istanbul. Istanbul, between two seas and two continents, like a brilliant diamond between two sapphires and two emeralds, would become the most precious gem on the world's ring. Just as Osman was about to put on this dream-like ring, he awoke.'\n\nAfter waking, Osman told the dream to Sheikh Edebali. Edebali interpreted it as an omen of conquering the world, that Osman would receive endless glory and power, and thus agreed to the marriage. Edebali also assisted Osman in formulating the administrative and moral code that would influence the following six centuries. He left Osman with an exhortation to encourage him, the final lines being: 'Be patient, beautiful flowers will always bloom; do not forget, human prosperity is the kingdom's prosperity! Oh my dear son! Heavy responsibilities will be placed upon you, strength will accompany you! May Allah bless you!'\n\nNow, the Ottoman Empire's territory encompasses all the lands mentioned in the Ottoman Dream, becoming the world's most powerful empire.

EDG_flavor_TUR_mission.11.title:0 "Military Doctrine"
EDG_flavor_TUR_mission.11.desc:0 "The tactical concept shaped by the European Military Revolution involved using defensive firearms in offensive warfare through the tactic of countermarch volley fire. However, given early modern firearms, both defense and offense required large numbers of well-trained firearm infantry. In actual combat, particularly in offensive warfare, there is an inherent conflict between large scale and maintaining order.\n\nMontecuccoli believed that heavy cavalry could form continuous firepower through the caracole to suppress Turkish cavalry. Yet in practice, cavalry often fired from a distance without daring to approach the enemy lines too closely. Firearm cavalry, whether using pistols or carbines, were close-range weapons; long-range shooting achieved limited results. Moreover, cavalry employing the caracole always tried to retreat within the cover of their own infantry. This aversion to engagement and active withdrawal easily exposed their backs to the Turks. In such situations, even if Turkish cavalry were more lightly equipped than European cavalry, they dared to launch assaults and could defeat European cavalry. Hungarian cavalry, who also favored cold-weapon charges, might not necessarily defeat their opponents, but clashes of swords could yield some results.\n\nA similar situation existed among infantry. Fear leading to indiscriminate firing, if not effectively controlled, could spread panic. Indiscriminate shooting also failed to form a stable, continuous firepower and would naturally fail against enemy assaults.\n\nTurkish tactics differed somewhat. Although Turks, both cavalry and infantry, were accustomed to using firearms, even in offense, they always preferred large-scale cold-weapon charges. They would fire a final volley before the final charge and then launch a total assault to achieve victory in one strike—a strategy described as the one-strike strategy.\n\nPoorly controlled Western European armies naturally disintegrated under such large-scale assaults. But if European armies held their ground, controlled the spread of panic, and conducted organized, coordinated full countermarch volley fire, a continuous and stable network of firepower could not only contain the enemy's advance but also exert immense pressure on the enemy during the advance.\n\nTurks remarked that German warriors might not be outstanding in individual bravery, but their discipline and coordination in combat were impressive. Western European volley fire methods were based on these prerequisites. At the Battle of Saint Gotthard, Ottoman soldiers described Christian forces' firepower as extremely intense and as precise as machinery during the advance. Ultimately, the Ottoman lines collapsed. Many insightful individuals viewed this as proof of the empire's outdated traditional military tactics and demanded reforms to the imperial military system. However, many Emirs argued that our failure stemmed precisely from our failure to respect tradition. Ultimately, the decision rested with the Padishah."

Their main objectives were to conquer the two Venetian castles of Nicosia and Famagusta. Due to poor command, Nicosia surrendered within six weeks. The surviving defenders were slaughtered; then, the city, said to have as many churches as there are days in a year, was sacked, its misery (according to Western Europeans) comparable to the Sack of Constantinople. The city's cathedral was converted into a mosque. Young residents, both men and women, who were attractive were sold into slavery. They were herded onto a galley, but before setting sail for Istanbul, the ship exploded. To preserve her chastity, a devout Christian woman set fire to the ship's magazine. The fortress of Famagusta proved extremely difficult to capture; the Venetian resistance impressed him deeply, and some even returned to Istanbul reporting that Famagusta's defenders included not only humans but giants. The Turks built fortifications, dug deep trenches passable by cavalry, then blew a breach in the walls with mines and launched a series of assaults on this gap. However, they encountered stubborn and heroic resistance. The defenders filled the moat in front of the bastions with firewood, brushwood, and other combustibles, then set it alight. The fire burned for several days. More distressing for the Turks, the defenders burned a type of wood grown on the island, which emitted a harmful stench when alight. Yet, the defenders gradually resorted to eating horses, donkeys, dogs, and 'other disgusting foods.' After a three-month siege, the defenders had only seven barrels of gunpowder left. Bragadin, having held out to the end, had no choice but to seek honorable surrender.\n\nMustafa agreed to his terms. Mustafa promised that if the fortress surrendered, all lives would be spared; the defenders could keep their weapons and be transported to Crete on Turkish ships, while the city's inhabitants could decide their own fate. Bragadin, accompanied by three officers and a guard, came to the Ottoman camp to hand over the city keys. Mustafa initially received him courteously, and both sides negotiated amicably. Then, trouble arose. First, accusations were made that Bragadin had slaughtered Ottoman prisoners; then, Mustafa demanded a hostage from the defenders to ensure the ships transporting them would return safely.\n\nBragadin refused this demand, citing a violation of the truce. Consequently, the notoriously hot-tempered Mustafa flew into a rage and outright declared the entire truce agreement null and void. Reportedly, he ordered Bragadin bound, then cut off his right ear and nose. After two weeks of torture in prison, Bragadin was shackled to a pillory in Famagusta's main square. After refusing to convert to Islam, he was flayed alive. His body was dismembered and publicly displayed. Then, Mustafa had Bragadin's skin dried, stuffed with straw, and paraded around the city on the back of an ox."

EDG_flavor_TUR_mission.18.title:0 "The Ottoman Dream"
EDG_flavor_TUR_mission.18.desc:0 "The founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman I, once had a dream.\n\n'He dreamed of a crescent moon rising from the chest of Sheikh Edebali, slowly sinking into his own chest. A great tree grew from the center of his body, its vibrant branches extending larger and larger until they covered the heavens and the earth. Beneath the tree were four great mountains, which Osman recognized as the Caucasus, Atlas, Taurus, and Balkan ranges. These four great mountains supported this sacred tree, at the very center of the world. From the tree's roots flowed four rivers: the Tigris, Euphrates, Danube, and Nile. Osman saw ships coming and going on the rivers, heard the clamor of domestic animals, fields full of harvest, hillsides covered with forests, springs and streams murmuring through cypress trees and rose bushes. His homeland shone with magnificent towns, majestic domes and turrets, pyramids and obelisks, minarets and towers. The crescent moon rose, its light illuminating the tower spires; he heard the beginning of the night prayer. The call to prayer blended with the sweet song of nightingales, echoed by parrots, and all the singing birds.'\n\n'Suddenly, the birds fled swiftly through the gaps in the intertwined branches; all the leaves on the tree turned into scimitars. A fierce gale arose, a violent wind carrying the blade-like leaves sweeping across the world towards Istanbul. Istanbul, between two seas and two continents, like a brilliant diamond between two sapphires and two emeralds, would become the most precious gem on the world's ring. Just as Osman was about to put on this dream-like ring, he awoke.'\n\nAfter waking, Osman told the dream to Sheikh Edebali. Edebali interpreted it as an omen of conquering the world, that Osman would receive endless glory and power, and thus agreed to the marriage. Edebali also assisted Osman in formulating the administrative and moral code that would influence the following six centuries. He left Osman with an exhortation to encourage him, the final lines being: 'Be patient, beautiful flowers will always bloom; do not forget, human prosperity is the kingdom's prosperity! Oh my dear son! Heavy responsibilities will be placed upon you, strength will accompany you! May Allah bless you!'"

EDG_flavor_TUR_mission.19.desc:0 "After capturing Egypt, the Ottoman Empire did not halt its advance but instead turned its gaze towards the vast Maghreb region to the west. The first target was the Tripoli region; the Ottoman armies surged forth like a mighty tide. Well-trained and equipped, they were unstoppable wherever they went. Faced with such formidable military might, the Tripoli region was swiftly annexed by the Ottoman Empire, incorporated into its vast territory. Many Berber mercenaries and chieftains chose to join the Ottoman Empire. The Berbers, long inhabiting the Maghreb, were familiar with the local terrain and customs. These mercenaries were fierce in battle, possessing unique combat skills, while the chieftains held certain influence and resources locally. They chose to align with the Ottoman Empire partly because they were awed by its immense power, believing that following such a powerful empire would bring better development and protection; on the other hand, they likely saw the new order and opportunities the Ottoman Empire might bring to these lands. Thus, with increasing numbers of Berbers joining, the Ottoman Empire's influence in the Maghreb region was further strengthened, and its conquest of the Maghreb seemed to proceed more smoothly. Now, Tunis felt unprecedented pressure, the entire region shrouded in the shadow of war. The Ottoman Empire meticulously planned each military step to achieve its grand ambition of conquering the entire Maghreb."

By the early 9th century, North African states declared independence, breaking away from the Arab Empire. It later developed into the largest city in North Africa, economically prosperous, attracting scholars, with highly developed Islamic academic culture. Later, Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, the Abbasid governor of Kairouan, established the Aghlabid dynasty, with Kairouan as its capital, and Kairouan evolved into the political, religious, commercial, and cultural center of Arab Africa. To this day, the city is regarded by Muslims as the holy city of Islam in North Africa. Once, the city had over 100 mosques, notably the Great Mosque of Uqba, the first grand mosque of Islam in North Africa, attached to a religious university; the mosque contained 600 large columns of granite or marble, in Roman, Arab, and Byzantine styles. Outside the city was the Sayyid Sahab Madrasa, containing the tombs of the companions of the Prophet. However, after the Children's Crusade, the holy city of Kairouan was occupied by Christians, and its mosques were largely destroyed."

Though only 22 years old at the time, his bravery in battle and talent for employing capable individuals were already renowned. Al-Nasir unified the Yemen region in 1356 and gradually launched campaigns against surrounding areas. He entered the political power struggles of the Arab region, filling the local power vacuum. Sahada rule was quite loose, with local areas retaining significant autonomy, which also enabled the dynasty's rapid expansion. By 1374, al-Nasir I had become a regional power in the Arab region, controlling nearly half of the Arabian Peninsula's territory. In 1380, Hajji II, the last Bahri Mamluk Sultan, was expelled from Cairo, but the Burji line could not quickly control the situation, sparking a Mamluk civil war. Both sides engaged in intense conflict, causing severe damage to Egypt's economy. The Bahri Sultan Hajji II sought aid from the Sahada dynasty, promising to cede territories in southwestern Arabia to the Grand Malik al-Nasir I and provide substantial annual tribute. After careful consideration, the 60-year-old al-Nasir I realized this was the best birthday gift Allah could grant him, so he led his army into Egypt. However, after helping the Bahri Sultan quell the rebellion, al-Nasir I then attacked the Bahri regime, ultimately replacing the Mamluks to become the Grand Malik of Egypt, once again bringing a powerful polity spanning Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula into existence.

These artisans represented superb craftsmanship, whether in crafting fine silverware or forging durable weaponry, each possessing unique techniques.

These governorates were located in northern, southern, eastern, and western India, each managed by a governor carefully selected by the Ottoman Empire. The governors held significant power, responsible for tax collection, maintaining order, and promoting Ottoman culture and law. However, the Ottoman homeland faced a shortage of population. To make the homeland more prosperous, a bold yet brutal plan was proposed: relocate large numbers of the Indian population to the Near East. Countless Indian people were forced to leave their homes, embarking on a migration journey to unfamiliar lands. Due to long treks, insufficient food and water, and difficulty adapting to new environments, many Indians perished along the way. But for the Ottoman Empire, the surviving Indians brought new labor.

But when our diplomat returned from Japan, he described Japanese society's beauty to [Root.Monarch.GetName], portraying it as a paradise infinitely more perfect than our nation, depicting the Japanese as gentle, intelligent, innocent, beautiful, peace-loving, and well-educated people. He grew increasingly emotional, eventually breaking into tears, vehemently denouncing [Root.GetName]'s armies for killing countless Japanese youth, causing numerous Japanese families to go bankrupt, and making countless Japanese mothers weep. When our Emir pointed out that we had killed soldiers in every corner of the world—that is simply the nature of war—and that we had enslaved people in Yemen, scalped heads in America, flayed skins in Egypt, subjected people to lingering death in China, and piled heads into pyramids in Persia, yet this diplomat had never uttered a word of protest before, now lavishing praise upon the Japanese. The Emir stated he could understand the diplomat's admiration for Japanese culture, religion, institutions, customs, products, even their way of life, but he could not comprehend why Japanese lives were deemed more valuable than others, more deserving of protection than Turks, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, Iraqis, and Arabs—if war itself is wrong, then what are we who conquered Constantinople and aim to conquer the world? How can we conquer the world yet treat every individual with mercy, view war as a game yet not let any enemy fall?\n\nOur diplomat righteously berated this Emir. In a resolute, unwavering tone, he declared that he did not see Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Bosnians, Kurds, Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Hindus, Dravidians, Malays, Chinese, Italians, Spanish, French, English, Germans, Russians, Poles, Balts, Yemenis, Berbers, or Mongols—he saw only the Japanese and cared only for the Japanese. If the Emir chose hostility toward the Japanese, he was hostile to the nation, the people, Allah, life, ethics, morality, and the universe. He claimed not to know how many [Root.GetName] people had died by Japanese blades—in fact, he asserted he did not believe the Japanese were capable of such acts because the Japanese were a kinder, more peaceful people than us. He insisted that we must not only treat the Japanese leniently but also allocate funds to aid them, preserving this wonderful nation. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] disagreed with this demand, then [Root.Monarch.GetName] was not a benevolent ruler, certainly not favored by Allah, but a cruel, bloodthirsty pervert, a scum rejected by all universal justice, unworthy not only of kingship but even of humanity."

The Church's wealth was evident not only in land and taxes but also in its possession of precious artworks and luxury goods, particularly gemstones. Due to their rarity and symbolic significance, gemstones were widely used in religious ceremonial objects such as reliquaries, vestments, chalices, crosses, and altar decorations. These gemstones were not only integral to religious rituals but also symbols of the Church's sanctity and authority. The Church's demand for gemstones not only fueled the gem trade's prosperity but also made gemstones a significant component of the European luxury market.\n\nHowever, with the Protestant Reformation, the practice of adorning sacred objects with ornate jewelry was questioned. One core tenet of the Reformation was opposition to Church corruption and extravagance, particularly criticism of Church wealth. Protestants argued that the Church used vast wealth on luxury goods and decorations rather than serving the needs of believers and society, which contravened Christian teachings. Consequently, Protestants rejected embellishing their sacred objects and churches with lavish jewelry. This led to a surplus of unsold jewelry in Germany and other regions undergoing reform. Many merchants who had depended on selling jewelry to the Church went bankrupt due to lack of buyers, causing jewelry prices to plummet."

He waged many wars against neighboring states, including the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession—three conflicts against coalitions formed to contain France—attempting to expand French territory to the 'natural frontiers' long advocated by previous French rulers. His reign saw the emergence of numerous military and political talents, including great commanders like the Vicomte de Turenne, the Grand Condé, the Duc de Luxembourg, and the Duc de Villars, as well as eminent ministers like Colbert, Vauban, and the Marquis de Louvois. These military and political figures made the Kingdom of France the wealthiest and most powerful nation in Europe at the time, creating the world's strongest army and navy, and establishing the undefeated myth of the glorious French era. At its peak, the French Royal Army's standing force reached 400,000, matching the combined standing armies of other European great powers. These troops were equipped with large quantities of flintlock muskets and early carbines, making the French army invincible. After the trials of the Thirty Years' War and the Franco-Spanish War, France's naval strength at the beginning of his reign numbered less than 20 warships. He ordered the establishment of large shipyards in France, the construction and development of harbors, enhancing French naval power. By 1683, France possessed 276 warships, becoming the foremost naval power capable of rivaling the combined fleets of England and the Netherlands. Through astute political maneuvers early in his reign and the efforts of his predecessors, he created the most brilliant and powerful golden age of French monarchy.

EDG_flavorFrench.4.desc:0 "The chanson de geste (song of heroic deeds) is an important literary genre originating from the oral folk literature of medieval France, gradually evolving into long epic narrative poems. Chansons de geste primarily celebrate the martial achievements and merits of the feudal ruling class, especially the heroic deeds of knights and their loyalty to their lords. The origins of the chanson de geste can be traced back to the late 12th to early 13th centuries when traveling minstrels known as "poètes troubadours" performed these works for castle lords. These poems typically consist of thousands or even tens of thousands of lines, written in decasyllabic verse and adhering to specific rhyming schemes, such as "laisses," where vowels must be identical while consonants may differ. This form absorbs the grandiosity of Homeric epics, incorporates emotive techniques from saints' lives, and retains the rhythmic feel of folk storytelling. In [Root.GetName], the chanson de geste has been well-preserved, and recently, a chanson de geste praising [Root.Monarch.GetName] has emerged, sparking a wave of enthusiasm for the genre within our country."

These virtues were reflected not only in knights' personal conduct but also in their sense of social responsibility. People admired knights, even composing numerous works; the French chivalric romance "The Three Kings' Sons" reflects the period's admiration for ancient heroes and its promotion of Christian chivalric ideals.

For a future queen, this meant she would no longer be just a sheltered flower in a greenhouse, but must begin to face the true storms of life.\n\n'I must give her something special,' Carle thought to himself, 'not jewelry, nor the golden goblets and silver plates common at feasts, but a gift she will remember her entire life.'\n\nHis first thought was a scepter.\n'A scepter symbolizes power and rule.' Carle looked out the window at the palace courtyard, thinking that if Bernadette could hold a gift symbolizing authority, it might make the German dukes and the French faction nobles show a bit more restraint in her presence. But he hesitated—a scepter, might it seem too heavy? She was still just a girl, and might feel forced to bear adult responsibilities because of it.\n\nHis second thought was a dictionary.\nCarle remembered Bernadette's curiosity about different languages in her studies, how she always asked her tutors about the meanings of ancient words. 'If a queen masters language, she masters hearts,' he mused. But a dictionary, while practical, lacked romance and could not provide immediate courage before her first public speech.\n\nHis third thought made his gaze firm—a fine horse.\nHe recalled their days riding wooden horses in the garden, and how she always gazed at the plains beyond the city gates. The true path of battle and diplomacy sometimes required not just words and symbols, but the speed and freedom of action. 'A fine horse can carry her away from danger, and take her to any place she wishes to go.' A surge of inexplicable passion rose in Carle's heart. 'This is not escape, but a way to take charge of her own destiny.'"

It aimed to resolve internal disputes within the Dutch Reformed Church regarding the doctrine of predestination, ultimately establishing Calvinist orthodoxy and profoundly influencing the religious and political landscape of the Dutch Republic.\n\nAttended by Dutch Republic and overseas pastors and theologians, this council marked the climax of the prolonged conflict between Calvinism and Arminianism. The first session commenced on November 13, 1618, with the final session concluding on May 29, 1619. A total of 180 sessions were held, with representatives invited from eight foreign presbyteries. The primary outcome was the formulation of the Canons of Dort, which presented resolutions on five main doctrinal points arising from the Arminian controversy. The Canons are structured in two parts for each point: one affirming Calvinist doctrine and the other refuting corresponding errors. Although formally comprising four points, they are commonly considered five, as the Canons were structured around the five articles of the 1610 Remonstrance.\n\nThe Synod of Dort had a profound impact on the Dutch Republic's religious and political spheres. It rejected Arminian viewpoints and established presbyterian doctrines, including total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints. The Synod also initiated the official Dutch Bible translation project, completed in 1637, which exerted a lasting influence on the standardization of the Dutch language. Politically, the condemnation of Arminian supporters led to the execution of statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, while Hugo Grotius received a life sentence following the Arminians' defeat but later escaped."

That day, she had slipped away from her governess's watchful eye and, clutching a book of ancient knightly tales, sat reading beneath a bare plane tree. As she lost herself in the story, a boy, still bearing traces of childhood yet brimming with a certain confidence, approached, his boots crunching softly on the snow.\n\n'What are you reading?' the boy asked, leaning slightly forward, his golden hair catching the sunlight with a warm glow.\nBernadette looked up, a slight frown on her face. 'Stories of knights. You wouldn't understand.'\n'Of course I do,' he declared, puffing out his chest. 'I'm going to be a real knight one day, to protect the kingdom... and you.'\nThis childish vow made the little princess pause for a moment before she couldn't help but laugh. 'Who are you?'\n'Carle of Hainaut, son of the Duke of Hainaut,' the boy said proudly. 'My father says I must learn to be friends with the future queen.'\nFrom that day on, they met almost daily in the garden. When spring arrived, Carle would bring a small wooden sword, and the two would engage in mock 'duels' on the grassy lawn. Carle always 'lost,' but did so with gentlemanly grace, wearing a triumphant yet gentle smile.\n\nOn summer evenings, during palace banquets, they would sneak away to the kitchen, snatch a few freshly baked honey biscuits, and share them while hiding by the stained-glass window at the end of the corridor. Carle always gave the largest piece to Bernadette, saying with feigned solemnity, 'A tribute from a brave knight to his queen.'\nIn autumn, with fallen leaves carpeting the garden, they would build 'castles' from the piles. Bernadette, as queen, sat upon her throne of leaves while Carle knelt on one knee, picking up the most beautiful maple leaf as a crown and placing it solemnly upon her head. 'Your Majesty, please give your command.' And she would always laughingly order him to catch a squirrel or find the reddest maple leaf.\nTheir friendship was not all play. Once, when Bernadette was punished with copying prayers for giving a wrong answer in her lessons, she sat dejectedly at her desk. Carle slipped in, copied half for her, and whispered, 'We're a team.'\n\nThrough those years in [Root.Capital.GetName], Bernadette gradually grew accustomed to having Carle by her side. He would make her laugh when she was downcast, and hold her hand when she was afraid. That companionship, in the turbulent kingdom, was like a small lamp, dispelling loneliness and chill."

Magnolia blossoms filled the palace gardens, their soft pink and snowy white petals interweaving into a gentle sea of clouds. It was in this season that the Regency Council announced news that would shake the entire kingdom.\n\nThat day, sunlight streamed through the towering stained-glass windows of the palace's grand hall, casting golden patterns on the floor like a long road laid out just for them. Bernadette wore an ivory-white gown adorned with the lily crest of her family; the two-meter-tall Carle stood beside her in a deep-blue ceremonial robe, bearing the silver eagle brooch of the House of Hainaut. This stalwart, lion-like knight had competed in dozens of tournaments without a single defeat, yet he pledged his unwavering devotion to his queen. Side by side before the altar, they received the archbishop's blessing.\n\nAs the archbishop concluded the ceremonial prayers, Carle gently took her hand. In that moment, Bernadette felt a sense of steadfastness she had never known before. She recalled their first meeting in the garden when she was eight, the 'castles' they built among autumn leaves, and the chestnut horse he had gifted her—now grown strong and agile, stabled in the royal stables as if silently witnessing their journey from childhood to this day.\n\nAt the betrothal feast, nobles raised their goblets in celebration—some with genuine blessings, others weighing hidden calculations. The pro-French faction saw this union as a bridge to maintain peace between the two sides, while the German faction speculated whether it was a royal maneuver to secure the loyalty of the House of Hainaut. But no matter the whispers, for Bernadette, this was the most certain moment of her life.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, Carle whispered to her, 'My lady, from this day forward, no matter what storms you face, I shall stand by your side.'\n\nBernadette smiled softly, her gaze resolute. 'Then let us walk together, my love. The road ahead may be long.'\n\nIn the lingering spring night, the palace lights illuminated their youthful faces—"

The Archbishop of Namur placed the scepter and orb, symbols of power, into her hands, as the gathered nobles and citizens cried out in unison, 'Long live Her Majesty the Queen!'\n\nThis was not only the moment a kingdom welcomed a new monarch but also a symbol of her liberation from the shackles of the Regency Council. The grand celebration that followed lasted three days and three nights, with Carle always by her side, just as they had pledged in their youth.\n\nNot long after, the palace was once again adorned with lights and colors—this time for the wedding of the Queen and Carle, son of the Duke of Hainaut. The ceremony took place in the Cathedral of Our Lady, where stained glass cast intertwined golden and crimson light, as if blessing them from heaven. Carle vowed, 'I pledge my life to protect the Queen, and our home.' Tears glistened in Bernadette's eyes, for she knew this was not just a lover's promise but the sturdiest anchor in the storms yet to come.\n\nA year later, the cry of a newborn echoed through the palace.

Thus, the child was named 'Louis,' in memory of the late King Louis VII, who had striven to maintain the kingdom's balance in tumultuous times.\n\nThese moments painted a brief golden age for Lotharingia.

Since contracting that mysterious illness in late autumn, little Louis grew thinner with each passing day. The physicians were at a loss, whispering only to the Queen and King, 'This is no ordinary ailment, but a demon's possession. Satan himself has cursed him.' Bernadette's face turned ashen upon hearing this, yet she clenched her teeth, refusing to believe her son was a forsaken soul.\n\nCarle, gazing at his frail son upon the sickbed, slowly removed the silver cross he had worn since childhood—a talisman his mother had placed around his neck at his baptism. Gently, he fastened it around little Louis's neck, his voice barely audible: 'May God's light protect you, as it has protected me.' Bernadette kept vigil by the bedside each day, as if by staying close, a mother's will could bar death from the door. She began telling him stories—how their Carolingian ancestors broke enemy lines on the battlefield, how lone knights fought valiantly for the glory of their homeland; and of the Crusaders crossing the seas, braving arrows and scorching sun on their pilgrimage to Jerusalem.\n\nLittle Louis loved the Crusader tales best. Whenever he heard how they raised the Cross banner beneath the walls of Antioch, a light would flicker in his eyes. Once, his breath faint, he said to his mother, 'When I'm better... I'll go to Jerusalem, see the Holy Sepulchre... then to Antioch, and Constantinople...'\nBernadette held his hand, fighting back tears as she smiled and nodded, never telling him the final outcome of the Crusades. She could not bear to shatter that tender hope.\n\nFinally, on a snowy night, the illness reached its end. Little Louis could scarcely speak, yet he mustered his strength to clasp his mother's hand, the light still in his eyes. He whispered hoarsely, 'Mother... did the Crusaders... win in the end?'\nBernadette's heart felt pierced by a blade. She leaned down, pressing her forehead to his, and softly said, 'Yes, my child, they were victorious.'\nHearing this, little Louis gave a peaceful smile, as if seeing himself astride a mighty steed, riding through Jerusalem's golden gates. Then, his small hand slowly relaxed, and his breath ceased in that moment.\n\nOutside, snow fell in silence, shrouding the palace in a blanket of white—pure and tranquil, as if laying a path to heaven for this little knight who never embarked on his crusade."

He often walked alone to the palace's west tower, gazing toward the distant horizon as if, through mountains and seas, he could see the Jerusalem his son had yearned for. He could not understand—why, with his unmatched valor and the bow not even the strongest paladin could draw, had he been unable to protect his own son?\nOn a crisp morning, Carle held a long conversation with the Archbishop of Namur in the Archbishop's Hall. Candlelight flickered on the stone walls as the Archbishop spoke in a low, measured voice: 'Your Highness, your son... was taken by Satan. Now his soul suffers in hell. Only when Jerusalem is liberated from the infidels, only when the Cross once more stands above the Holy Sepulchre, can his soul be carried to heaven by the angels.'\n\nCarle's heart tightened as if crushed by a great stone. He refused to believe his son was condemned to hell, yet each of the Archbishop's words pierced him like a nail. That night, sleep eluded him as he wrestled repeatedly with agony and rage. He recalled his son's final smile on the sickbed—those eyes yearning not for survival, but for a future where the Holy Land would be restored to Christendom.\n\nWeeks later, he embarked alone on the journey to Rome. The hardships of the long trek left his face gaunt and weary. When he knelt before the Holy See, the burden on his heart seemed to pour forth all at once.\n'Most Holy Father,' Carle choked out, 'my son is no longer of this world... I have been told his soul is in hell. How can I rescue him from the flames?'\nThe Pope gazed at him, his eyes holding both pity and a glimmer of hope. 'Carle, if you are truly willing to give everything for God and your bloodline, then raise the Cross. Lead your knights across the seas and breach the gates of Jerusalem. Then, your son shall meet you in heaven.' A nearly fervent light ignited in Carle's eyes. He bowed his head and kissed the ring extended by the Pope.\nThe Pope's words echoed incessantly in his mind—'Liberate Jerusalem, and your son shall meet you in heaven.' But this time, he thought not only of the departed little Louis. They had another young son—Gabriel. A child whose smile shone like the dawn, yet in the depths of night, Carle would sometimes wake in terror, dreaming of shadows slithering into the palace, coiling like serpents around the child's cradle. He feared that same unseen evil that had consumed Louis might descend upon Gabriel.\n\nWhen he returned to [Root.Capital.GetName], Bernadette stood silently in the palace garden, one hand holding the cross necklace Carle had given little Louis, the other leading their young son, Gabriel. Carle walked to her, his voice hoarse yet resolute, speaking of his love for her, for Louis, and for Gabriel, recounting the words of the Archbishop and the Pope, expressing his hope to journey to Jerusalem—to secure Louis's place in heaven and ensure Gabriel's healthy growth. Bernadette looked at him, tears welling in her eyes, but she did not stop him. She simply extended her hand, placing the cross necklace into Carle's palm. 'Then go, Carle. Take his dream with you. Gabriel and I will wait here for you.' With that, Carle knelt and embraced his son, his tears falling upon Gabriel's face.\n\nIn that moment, the spring breeze swept through the garden, yet it carried the scent of iron and blood—the war drums of the path to the Holy Land had already begun to beat within their hearts."

The dull, grating sound of hammers striking iron spikes seemed to seal their fates. As the spikes pierced wrists and ankles, blood trickled down the stakes, dripping onto sun-scorched flagstones. The relentless sun hung overhead, blistering their skin, cracking their lips, blinding their eyes with its glare. Their breath grew ragged, their throats hoarse, sweat and blood mingling into a final, macabre anointment.\n\nAfter a full day of exposure, the shadows of dusk slowly crept across the square, yet Gabriel, who had arrived in person, showed not a trace of mercy in his eyes. He raised a hand, pointing toward the bronze cannons already positioned at the square's edge. It was a heavy, gleaming instrument of death, its dark muzzle aimed at the first row of those nailed to crosses. Gunpowder and iron shot were swiftly loaded, the fuse lit, and the cannon roared like thunder—\nThe shockwave tore through the air, the iron shot instantly shattering the seven crucified bodies ahead into fragments. Flesh and splintered bone sprayed through the air, raining onto flagstones, banners, even the garments of onlookers, like a cruel firework woven of crimson and gray. The air filled with the stench of seared flesh and acrid gunpowder. Among the crowd, some gasped, others held their breath, but none dared utter a sound. Gabriel's expression remained icy; he merely lifted his hand slightly and issued another command—\nThe second cannon fired.\n\nThe remaining six were torn apart by iron and fire into countless pieces, as if their existence had been utterly erased from the world. No groans, no struggle—only a mist of blood drifting in the sunset, staining the royal sky crimson.\nThe square fell into a terrifying silence, the cannon's echoes alone reverberating between the walls, as if proclaiming to all the Germanic lands—the old era is dead.\n\nAll understood clearly: this was no mere execution. Gabriel's hatred for the Germans ran bone-deep; this was a carnival belonging to Gabriel, belonging to the new age of [Root.GetName]."

Market stalls were torn apart like skeletons gnawed by beasts, gold and silk plundered, wine barrels split open, wine mingling with blood on the cobblestones. Germans fled in all directions, but around every corner awaited a tempest of steel.

None counted the bodies, nor buried them—the stench of decay itself became one of the city's spoils. By sunset, Frankfurt's square had become an altar of victory.

The storm came from the south. The late summer sea winds whipped the sails of warships like gray banners unfurling across the horizon. Upon the waters, dozens of [Root.GetName] vessels cut northward through the waves, their iron rams gleaming in the sunset like a pack of ravenous predators. The harbor bells rang urgently before dawn, but their sound against war drums and horns was as fragile as a guttering candle in the wind.\n\nThe moment the city gates were breached, Lübeck's streets became rivers of spears and torches. Soldiers advanced along both sides of the canals, battering down doors, searching for gold, grain, and captives. Warehouse gates were hewn open with axes; goods from Baltic ports spilled into the central square, spices and flour mingling into a mass stained the color of blood. Merchants' mansions were stripped bare—silver utensils from cabinets stuffed haphazardly into leather sacks, navigational charts torn from walls to wrap loot. Harbor cranes were pushed into the sea, moored ships set ablaze, flames churning upon the dark waters. Lübeck's citizens tried to resist, but their short swords and clubs were useless against knights' lances. Captured Hanseatic German merchants were strung together by ropes threaded through their collarbones, chained in a line like sea beasts dragged ashore. Women were pulled across stone steps, their cries scattering amid the firelight, lost in the heavy clash of armor.\n\nBy evening, Lübeck had lost its form—it was a burning ruin of collapsed masts. The harbor waters reflected the flames like a boiling pool of blood. His Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood upon the high stone wall overlooking the harbor, gazing down upon the conflagration.

Iron-shod feet trampled the vineyards outside the walls; war drums echoed over the Danube's surface as if the entire river trembled for the city's fall. The gates split under the bombardment of trebuchets like old, rotten planks. Flaming oil was poured into the breaches, the fierce blaze driving defenders back.\n\nThe first to pour into the city were infantry with long spears. They did not rush to slaughter, but made straight for the granaries and treasuries. Ulm's wealth, once slumbering in oak barrels and stone vaults, now spilled into the streets. Wheat grains and gold coins rolled in the bloody water like dust in the sunlight. Cavalry following close behind cut down any who dared stand, whether they held swords or loaves of bread.\n\nThe market square soon became a place of execution. German artisans and guild masters were dragged to the fountain, their hands and feet bound to wagon wheels. The crack of the breaking wheel was sharp and piercing beneath the scorching sun. Women were herded into the church; its bells tolled amidst screams and weeping until, engulfed in flames, it crumbled to ashes drifting on the river wind.\n\nThat night, Ulm was no longer a glorious city, but a smoldering heap of rubble.

EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.0.desc:0 "During the reign of Charles the Fat, he briefly reunified all the lands once ruled by Charlemagne and was crowned Emperor by Pope John VIII in 881. However, his rule was exceedingly weak, and the empire's unity was largely superficial. In 887, Charles the Fat was deposed and replaced by his nephew, Arnulf, Duke of Carinthia. The fall of Charles the Fat marked the onset of chaos and disintegration for the unified Frankish state. The poor geopolitical environment of the Lotharingian Empire destined it to face threats from all sides, yet thanks to Emperor Arnulf's exceptional balancing skills, Lotharingia was passed to his youngest son, Zwentibold, rather than to "Louis the Child." In exchange, Louis received the Kingdom of East Francia as compensation. Of course, for "Louis the Child," obeying a younger brother was an absolutely unacceptable reality. He and his vassals spread rumors claiming Zwentibold was, in fact, a bastard. But Louis, frail and possibly suffering from depression, ultimately became entangled in the power labyrinths of East Francia, while Lotharingia remained under the inheritance of Zwentibold's descendants. During the Carolingian era in Europe, the kings of Lotharingia faced hostility and neglect from the other Carolingian dynasties. Yet as the various splintered Carolingian dynasties gradually declined, this "bastard" dynasty finally outlasted all the more legitimate Carolingian descendants and became the last dynasty to dare claim descent from Charlemagne."

EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.1.title:0 "German Resistance"
EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.1.desc:0 "In the 12th century, Lotharingia became embroiled in a prolonged tug-of-war with the Holy Roman Empire. On the surface, King Louis III of Lotharingia expanded his territories and was undoubtedly the victor. By 1349, he had pushed his sword toward the Rhine, annexing numerous Imperial princes and even occupying Cologne and Trier, actions that nearly led to his excommunication. To appease the Holy See, the King of Lotharingia sent a ship laden with gold plundered from the Empire into the mouth of the Tiber, which kept the Pope silent. Yet behind prosperity often lurks the seeds of destruction. The Imperial princes harbored grudges against their submission to Lotharingia while maintaining a high degree of autonomy and local armed forces. After the death of Louis III, the royal court's control over these regional princes gradually waned over time. Notably, one of the German principalities annexed by Louis III was the Duchy of Jülich-Berg, whose rulers—the House of Jülich-Berg—could trace their lineage back to "Louis the Child." They lost their territories in Jülich during Louis's invasion but retained the title of Count of Berg, continuing to rule Berg thereafter.\n\nBy the 13th century, Lotharingia was nearly submerged in chaotic court coups. Local power brokers continuously favored "the most legitimate Carolingian princes" like waves from the North Sea, resulting in frequent throne changes and a constant stream of child monarchs. These young rulers, proud of their lineage yet utterly ineffectual, repeatedly traded greater autonomy for the support of powerful nobles, and the vassals scarcely needed to send their wealth to the royal court. "The Century of Chaos" gradually hollowed out the kingdom until Lotharingia retained little sense of unity. The dukes formed factions based on language and lineage, dividing into pro-French and pro-German factions. Over centuries of struggle, the pro-French faction gradually gained dominance and continually sought to weaken the power of the German nobility.\n\nDespite Lotharingia occupying a strategic crossroads in Western Europa, its interior was riddled with dukes and bishops whose loyalty to the royal court was tenuous at best. Cultural and linguistic differences turned Lotharingia into a kingdom that was "grand in name only." The Germans within the kingdom were eager to break free from the Lotharingian monarchy, which persistently sought to diminish their power, and instead align themselves with the Empire, which offered greater decentralization and was ruled by their fellow Germans. By 1444, the leader of the German nobility was Duke Gerhard of Jülich-Berg. During "the Century of Chaos," he seized control of Cologne, a holy site of Christianity, while the Carolingian court could only govern the vast rural areas around the city. To make matters worse, Duke Gerhard continually incited the Archbishop of Cologne against the King. These mounting conflicts cast a dark cloud over the kingdom's future."

Seizing the opportunity, King Louis VII of Lotharingia invaded France, defeated and captured Hugues VI at Caen. Since Louis VII's mother was a member of the Capetian dynasty, the King of Lotharingia forced Hugues VI to sign the 'Treaty of Caen,' which revoked the inheritance rights of the French Dauphin, Hugues VII, and designated Louis VII as the heir to the French throne. Hugues VI soon died from an infection, and Louis VII claimed the French crown, intending to be crowned King of France at Reims. However, the Dauphin Hugues successfully crowned himself King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, later known as 'the Victorious,' with Joan of Arc by his side. By 1438, the French had repelled the invasions by Lotharingians, English, and Arlesians, bringing the Four Nations' War to an end and completely shattering Lotharingia's ambitions to expand westward."

To secure recognition from the powerful German nobility, Louis of the Carolingians married a young and beautiful Hohenstaufen princess from Sicily. However, the cost of this wedding was nearly covered by what amounted to begging from his own vassals, earning Louis the informal title of 'Beggar King' at the time. Through thirty years of effort, Louis barely sustained his role as mediator between the two factions. Yet he also knew that after his passing, the monarchy's position would inevitably become untenable, and his heir—his only daughter, Bernadette—was born without acceptance under the Salic Law. Although he had compelled his vassals to sign recognition of his heir before God's altar, in the face of swords, paper held no binding power whatsoever. Much evidence suggested that Duke Gerhard was already prepared to lead the German nobility in opposition to the future queen.\n\nBut Louis VII knew he was aging and would soon depart this world, clearly unable to produce another heir. He wondered if he would live to see Bernadette grow into adulthood, yet the little princess's innate intelligence brought rare smiles to Louis's face.\n\nThe Capetian dynasty of France was striving to centralize power and expand royal domains through crusades against the Cathars of southern France. The French King, especially Hugues the Victorious, coveted Lotharingian lands and could launch an attack at any moment of weakness. England, though having experienced much turmoil and decline over the past decades, if Albion were reunified, its ambitions would lie just a step away from Lotharingia. Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, though aged and mired in the Hussite Wars, might have little time to look westward for now, but Frederick III, the future German King unanimously supported by the Imperial Electors, was in his prime and keen to extend Habsburg influence to the Empire's western borders. Meanwhile, Louis of the Carolingians of Lotharingia was already past his prime, his only heir a girl whom Lotharingian nobles believed could never succeed to the throne.

The great endeavor of governing Europe rightfully belongs to its direct descendants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kingdom of France also proclaims itself the 'heart of Frankish civilization,' leveraging the historical significance of Paris and Reims within its territories to claim itself as the true guardian of Charlemagne's legacy.\n\nThis contest for legitimacy has repeatedly surfaced since the Middle Ages, but by the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], with the drastic deterioration of geopolitical relations between the two nations, the issue frequently escalates into greater conflicts.\n\n'From Aachen to Rome, from the Rhine to the Danube, the Frankish sword and cross once unified heaven and earth.

This war is not for land or gold, but for legitimacy and divine mandate!'\n\nThe struggle between the two sides has evolved from words to military clashes, erupting into the massive 'War of Frankish Succession.' For [Root.GetName], it is a crusade to restore the glory of Charlemagne; for France, it is a desperate fight to defend its national and historical legitimacy. The nations of Europe watch with bated breath, while the Papacy observes cautiously, knowing well that the outcome of this war will determine who may speak for the 'Frankish world' in the future."

The gates stood wide open; golden fleurs-de-lis and eagle banners intertwined in the air, creating an unprecedented majesty and harmony. Dukes once loyal to the King of France surged toward the throne like a tide, draped in their finest robes, bearing jewels and treasures, their pledges of land and fealty, prostrating themselves at the feet of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nThat throne—not the throne of France, but the throne of Charlemagne—regained its majesty in this moment.

This was no simple ceremony, but the unification of a thousand years of Western history. The cross atop the scepter refracted piercing light in the dawn, as if reaching straight to the heavens, as though God Himself had inscribed a decree here—this person is Charlemagne's sole heir.\n\nOne by one, the dukes approached, knees touching the ground, lips brushing the scepter, whispering, 'My King.' The voices merged into a tide, a storm, thunder echoing across every peak of the continent.\n\nThe scent of victory filled every street and alley. Market women tossed petals to soldiers; children chased knights' cloaks; blacksmiths raised cups by their forges, praising this most pious Christian king. The air of Paris mingled incense with the lingering scent of gunpowder—two aromas that epitomized [Root.GetName]—pious yet mighty, gentle yet unassailable.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] rose slowly, gazing upon the endless submission and adoration. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes passed over the crowd, beyond Paris's walls, beyond countless battlefields strewn with bones and blood. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew this belonged not just to [Root.Monarch.GetName] alone, but to the resurgence of a people, the legitimacy of a dynasty, the spirit of Charlemagne crowned a millennium ago.\n\n'I am King of [Root.GetName], and the sole heir of the Franks!' [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared loudly. 'God is with me, and all nations shall bow before me.'\n\nThe voice reverberated under the vault of Notre-Dame, carried by the wind to every corner of Paris. People knew that from this day forth, the order of the continent would be rewritten by [Root.GetName]. The sovereign's prestige lay not only in the edge of the sword but in the weight of faith and history.\n\nOn this day, the waters of the Seine seemed slower, brighter, reflecting an undeniable truth—Charlemagne's glory had returned, and the name of [Root.GetName] would be etched forever beneath Europe's sky, alongside the Cross of Christ."

Since Otto I assumed the title 'Emperor of the Romans,' the Holy Roman Emperors have claimed to be the true heirs of Charlemagne, treating us as nothing. Meanwhile, the German princes, even under our rule, maintained declarations of loyalty to the Emperor.

These foundational disciplines lay a solid groundwork for students advancing to higher faculties (such as Theology, Law, and Medicine).\n\nThe University of Bernadette I enrolls students aged approximately 10 to 30, providing generous subsidies for students and clergy. Later, when Voltaire taught at this university, he also received substantial stipends. Furthermore, Bernadette not only funded the establishment of the colleges but also built multiple public facilities for the university, such as the Bernadette I Bridge and the Avenue of the Golden Apple, which future scholars would admire. Additionally, the Queen granted the University of Bernadette I the exclusive right to confer bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, further solidifying its authoritative status in academia.\n\nThis university possesses vast educational resources, and we must carefully determine its location...

EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.34.desc:0 "With the development of capitalism, there is no doubt that the status of artisans has been declining. Guilds no longer protect them, while merchants and capitalists have gained increasing opportunities to exploit workers.\n\nThe Lotharingian government promulgated the famous 'Cologne Act' in $YEAR$. Its main provisions include: First, regardless of the trade, the minimum apprenticeship period is seven years, and work for workshop owners must continue until the age of 24; the minimum workday is 12 hours. Second, all laborers' wages are determined by county magistrates based on commodity prices and seasons and managed by the Privy Council. Third, all labor hires must be under contracts lasting at least one year. Fourth, when changing employers, laborers must possess a release certificate from their previous employer.\n\nThe enactment of the 'Cologne Act' was not accidental but based on the socio-economic conditions of Lotharingia at the time. In the mid-16th century, Europe experienced multiple wars and economic crises, leading to increased population mobility and imbalances in the labor market. Against this backdrop, the Lotharingian government sought to stabilize the labor market through legislation, preventing excessive mobility and disorderly competition. This law imposed extra-economic coercion on laborers, compelling them to adhere to capitalist labor discipline, and objectively created conditions for the transition to capitalism."

EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.36.desc:0 "In the 16th century, the Kingdom of Lotharingia experienced a unique Renaissance, a period known as the 'Golden Age of Literature.'\n\nThe Renaissance is typically closely associated with Italian history. However, as a strategically located region in Central Europe, Lotharingia's cultural and political development was also profoundly influenced by the broader intellectual transformations of this era across Europe. The rise of the Renaissance in Lotharingia was closely linked to the Renaissance movements in other parts of Europe. At its core, the Renaissance emphasized humanism, highlighting human value and reason, and encouraging the pursuit of knowledge and self-fulfillment. Influenced by these ideas, Lotharingian scholars began to re-examine classical literature and art, integrating them with their own culture. They studied Ancient Greek and Latin, blending them with the vernacular to produce a wealth of literary works. Concurrently, Italian dramatic forms deeply impacted the development of theatre in Lotharingia, leading to the emergence of numerous tragedies and comedies.\n\nIn poetry, Lotharingian poets were influenced by the Italian sonnet. These works were not only formally inspired by Italian models but also embodied the spirit of humanism in content, emphasizing personal emotions and social reality. Lotharingia's literary golden age was also evident in the development of drama. Like English Renaissance drama, Lotharingian theatre reached a pinnacle. Dramatic works were influenced by Ancient Greek and Roman theatre in form and reflected contemporary social realities and humanist ideas in content. Lotharingian playwrights created many socio-political plays, love and family dramas, and literary plays, which gained popularity domestically and exerted significant influence in other European countries."

Karl Aell, an ordinary peasant clad in humble chainmail and wielding a common longsword, stood before the final jousting arena. His opponent was the noble-born knight, the renowned Louis de Barre, splendidly armored and imposing. However, once the match began, Karl's skill astonished everyone. Agile and fierce in his movements, he nearly struck his opponent several times, ultimately winning the match with a precise thrust. The commoners cheered wildly, proud of Karl's courage and prowess. Karl's victory not only earned the audience's acclaim but also made him famous throughout Lotharingia.\n\nYet, after the tournament, Karl's triumph sparked significant controversy. Nobles accused him of being 'unworthy' of the championship, arguing that as a mere commoner, he did not deserve the glory of victory. In Lotharingia, tournament champions often qualified to join the King's officer corps, but the nobility strongly opposed making Karl a general.

Developed by Spanish military theorists and widely adopted by the Spanish army, its emergence marked the maturity of a military system combining cold weapons and firearms, laying the foundation for modern European military institutions. The core of the Tercio tactic lies in mixing pikemen and musketeers to form an infantry formation capable of both defense and offense. Pikemen were responsible for repelling enemy cavalry charges, while musketeers provided long-range fire support. This combination gave the Tercio strong defensive capabilities against both heavy cavalry and infantry threats. Our military strategists recognize the advantages of this tactic and believe that Tercio formations will dominate Europe for a long time to come.

This force was called the 'New Army.' Today, [Root.Monarch.GetName] still maintains this army.\n\n'The loyalty of the old army is easily swayed by gold and family ties, but the New Army's loyalty shall be inscribed in blood and oath. Their blades shall be the shield of royal authority.'\n\nThe New Army is garrisoned at the Fort Saint-Pierre outside the walls of [Root.Capital.GetName]—a recently expanded fortress surrounded by orderly barracks and training grounds. Each morning, trumpets sound beyond the city as soldiers drill in formation, pikes standing like a forest, banners flapping in the wind. The citizens of [Root.Capital.GetName] often gaze at this army through the morning mist, feeling both awe and pride.\n\nHowever, the establishment of the New Army did not go unchallenged. Some French nobles feared that stripping local armed forces of power would weaken their defensive influence on the borders, while remaining German factions viewed the New Army as a tool for Lotharingian centralization. They spread rumors in the shadows, claiming the New Army's training was intended to suppress the kingdom's subjects rather than defend against external threats. Over time, however, the New Army not only became a pillar of military strength but also gradually infiltrated the kingdom's political structure. Its officers, though of commoner origins, earned titles through merit—a development that, in the eyes of the old nobility, shook the feudal order. Yet for [Root.Monarch.GetName], this was a necessary step to consolidate royal power—only a kingdom reliant on the emerging class and a centralized army could break free from the grip of local factions.\n\nAt a grand military review, thousands of New Army soldiers stood in neat formations, their armor reflecting the winter sun. The kingdom's banners fluttered high in the cold wind. From the viewing platform, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed upon this force shaped by [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s own hand and said slowly to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s retainers: 'From this day forth, the heart of Lotharingia shall be guarded by these loyal sons.

The winds of Iberia carried the scent of sea salt and blood. Beside the ruined mosque, a newly erected cross stood tall, proclaiming the victory of Christendom. In the camp north of the city, the army stood in neat formations, their armor gleaming like a sea under the sun. Dust and sweat mingled in the air, warhorses neighed restlessly.

The soldiers around stood silent as mountains, only the wind rustling the banners.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s voice was clear and powerful: 'People of Lotharingia, ye are warriors of God!' [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s right hand, the crucifix in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s grasp reflecting a blazing light. 'For hundreds of years, this land was defiled by the hands of infidels. The banners of Al-Andalus once flew proudly here, but now they have been shattered by your pikes. You marched into Barcelona over the enemy's rubble not for plunder, not for vainglory, but to fulfill the mission God has granted us.'\n\nThe soldiers gripped their weapons, breath quickening.\n\n'The Crusade is not only in books, not only in priests' pulpits—the Crusade lies on the very soil your feet have trodden! Every inch of field we reclaim, every church where bells ring again, is a mark of Heaven. You triumph not only through steel and courage, but because God favors Lotharingia.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] paused, scanning the wind-carved faces. 'Remember, the enemy is not only the warrior with blade in hand, but also those who deny the true God, who seek to corrupt our faith. You are God's shield and God's sword. The shield protects the faithful, the sword severs evil.'\n\nA roar erupted from the ranks; standard-bearers raised high the kingdom's gold-and-white banner, its cross burning brightly in the sunlight.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] continued: 'From Aachen to Barcelona, from the Rhine to the Mediterranean, our mission is to let Christ's light shine in every corner. Those who forsake the faith shall tremble at your feet; those who follow Christ shall rest secure behind you. Your victories shall be recorded in history books, sung by poets, and crowned by the Church.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] drew [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s sword, pointing its tip southward. 'Before us lie lands yet to be liberated, brethren groaning under the yoke of infidelity. Army of Lotharingia, ye are warriors chosen by God, guardians of the Covenant! May your pikes never bend, may your banners never fall!'\n\nThe entire army roared in unison, shaking the walls of Barcelona: 'For Lotharingia! For Christ!'

Located adjacent to the waterway, the mill facilitated the transport of raw materials and finished goods while harnessing water power to drive its looms. Silk was an extremely expensive luxury in the kingdom, nearly exclusive to the nobility and the Church. Now, the ruler was determined to control silk production, breaking dependence on foreign merchants and firmly securing profits within the royal treasury. The Crown recruited the most skilled weavers from Italy's Genoa and Venice, who brought intricate jacquard techniques and secret dyeing formulas. Working alongside local artisans in Aachen's silk mill, they taught their craft hands-on, ensuring Lotharingian silk rivaled famed imports from the East.

EDG_flavor_LOT_mission.46.desc:0 "Aachen's foundries buzzed with activity in the winter mist, the clang of hammers blending with the low roar of furnaces, like the heartbeat of the kingdom's military preparations. The spirit of the Renaissance had long permeated this place, from the anatomically detailed drawings of illustrators to the measuring tools in artisans' hands—every suit of armor reflected the latest understanding of human anatomy and ironworking techniques.\n\nThe Renaissance brought many new technologies, including advances in human anatomy and ironworking, continuously improving the armor-making craft in the Kingdom of Lotharingia. Many officers and nobles began commissioning their own armor, further increasing its prevalence. Queen Bernadette had once mass-produced armor for the royal central army, and we intend to continue this practice. The available choices include Milanese plate, Greenwich armor, and Gothic armor.\n\nMilanese plate, famed from Italian workshops in Milan, features smooth, rounded contours with thick, sturdy plates, excelling at defending against arrows and spears. Its elegant curves and polished sheen resemble rolling silver waves under sunlight, highly intimidating. However, Milanese plate is heavy and costly; equipping large forces would be a significant financial burden.\n\nGreenwich armor, originating from English royal workshops, combines beauty and practicality, with breastplates and pauldrons often adorned with exquisite engravings and gilded patterns. This armor serves both as combat gear and a display of status, ideal for the kingdom's central army as the 'elite among elites.' Yet, Greenwich armor is complex to produce, requiring skilled engravers and gilders, resulting in slower production rates.\n\nGothic armor, born in the German lands, features sharp lines and angular edges, with pleated plate structures that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective at dispersing weapon impacts. Compared to Milanese and Greenwich armor, Gothic armor strikes a good balance between weight and protection, and its craft is more widespread among German blacksmiths, facilitating mass production.\n\nRegardless, the brilliance of Milan, the splendor of Greenwich, the edge of Gothic—each type of armor symbolizes power. Yet what our central army needs is not merely protective gear, but a standard that strikes fear into the enemy at first sight."

However, this time, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s requirement was not for luxury like Milanese plate, but for a set of sturdy, economical armor to be universally issued to the entire army. At the military equipment council, the Treasurer spread open the ledgers and stated bluntly: 'The more expensive the armor, the more limited the increase in protection, while cost multiplies exponentially. Equipping a hundred thousand soldiers with Milanese plate would likely drain the treasury for over three years.' The Minister of Military Affairs reminded that although cheap armor couldn't withstand spears or crossbow bolts head-on like refined plate, it could significantly reduce minor injuries and bleeding on the battlefield, extending soldiers' combat endurance.\n\nThe Treasurer argued that half-plate armor, covering only the chest, back, and upper thighs, combined with chainmail or thick gambesons, would be cost-effective and defend against most slashes and projectiles.

Incorporating it as a direct domain would allow us to control ports and trade routes, funneling gold steadily into Aachen's coffers. However, the English were stubbornly nationalistic, and the already Celticized Scots would not easily submit. Of course, our diplomats proposed a novel idea—installing a British puppet king of our own selection and support. We could guide them under religious pretext while reducing the burden of direct rule.

This land, once called 'Europe's wound,' had witnessed the hollow coronation of Charles the Fat, endured the humiliating maneuvers of 'Beggar King' Louis among his vassals, and suffered the disgrace of countless puppet monarchs stumbling on the steps of Cologne Cathedral during the 'Century of Chaos.' Now, the Carolingian dynasty had found the 'Gold of the Rhine.' Ancient prophecies revealed that the bearer of Alberich's ring would rule this world. Europa was being reforged between the iron hooves of warhorses and the parchment of legal codes—not a mere territorial annexation, but a six-century-long redemption of civilization.\n\nBeneath the rose windows of Dublin Castle, Celtic bards sang of the beacons lit by Lotharingian knights on the Hastings coast; the mosaics of Cologne Cathedral recorded the golden spray when the Imperial fleet broke the chains of the Golden Horn. The Papacy, which once relegated the Lotharingian royal house to the end of pilgrimage processions, now had to concede that the Emperor's tongue could be used in Mass alongside Latin. Those German Electors who mocked the 'Bastard Dynasty' now knelt on the alabaster floors of Aachen Palace, kissing the Imperial scepter engraved with the arms of Zwentibold. Alpine passes flew silk merchant banners embroidered with the Lotharingian double cross, while in Carpathian mines, Germanic artisans forged new crowns from Transylvanian gold—this time set with a single star sapphire from the Black Sea coast. Servants scattered silver Groschen to the watching populace, letting distinguished guests take amusement in the common folk's scramble for wealth—these silver coins bearing the Carolingian emblem circulated freely throughout Europe.\n\nThe dome fresco of the Imperial Council Hall depicted this cycle of fate: on the left, John VIII placing the crown on Charles the Fat in 881, then demanding military guarantees to defend Rome from Saracens; on the right, Charlemagne and his reverent attendants. Dominating the center was a certain lunar eclipse night in the 15th century, when the last Burgundian army laid down arms in the Vosges, and Lotharingian Princess Matilda crossed the moonlit Saar River with sword in hand. On the hall's marble floor, geometers from Yorkshire sketched new imperial boundaries with red sandstone powder, while troubadours from Provence already sang: 'The shadow of Yggdrasil now covers all the earth.'\n\nThe true strength of this empire, forged through six centuries of humiliation and countless years of war, lay not in its arrow-studded border castles, but in the Codex of All Nations being compiled in the Strasbourg University library—a monumental work written in eight languages, transforming Charlemagne's lost dream of unity into a viable path. While hidebound scholastics still debated 'how many angels could stand on the head of a pin,' Lotharingian judges were resolving debt disputes between Burgundian wine merchants and Novgorod fur traders.\n\nThe chroniclers who prophesied 'Lotharingia shall die in disgrace' never imagined that when Duke Gerhard's descendants surrendered the keys to Cologne Cathedral, they received not an edict of exile, but the ivory staff of Chief Justice of the Imperial Western Commercial Court. Walloon nobles who once threatened to defect to France now prided themselves on speaking court French with a Liège accent; Rhine knights who clamored to return to Germany proudly displayed compound coats of arms granted by the Emperor. In the Nuremberg Imperial Mint, crucibles melting old coins flowed with metallic solutions from Bordeaux gold and Danzig silver, just as the Mainz Cathedral organ played Gregorian chant and Hungarian folk songs simultaneously—a fusion of tempered alloys."

When the high towers of Vienna came into view, Lotharingian artillery had already shattered the city gates. Within weeks, Vienna's defenses crumbled under relentless assault. Though the valleys of Styria attempted resistance with fortified strongholds, both knightly charges and militia defenses were systematically dismantled by the discipline and firepower of the royal army.\n\nWhen the last Austrian regular forces surrendered near Graz, [Root.Monarch.GetName] wrote only six words on the war report—'The Defeat of Ostmark.' This term quickly spread throughout Lotharingia, becoming both a symbol of military victory and a potent tool of political propaganda. The court historian proclaimed in the great hall of [Root.Capital.GetName]: 'Ostmark, the former frontier, is now the kingdom's shield. Vienna's palaces shall serve us, Styrian iron and salt shall fill our granaries.'\n\nThe court chronicle recorded: In the spring of the $YEAR$th year of our Lord, His Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetName] personally led the central army and the New Army eastward from the Bavarian plains, banners blotting out the sun, war drums like thunder. The land of Ostmark had long served as the eastern barrier of the Empire, hereditarily guarded by the Archdukes of Austria. Its capital, Vienna, relied on the Danube for defense, boasting high walls and heavy cannons, confident in its impregnability. On the first day of the fourth month, His Majesty's forces reached Linz, where Austrian troops arrayed for battle. The paladins shattered their vanguard, the roar of muskets stunning the enemy. Vienna's defenders retreated before the wind; within ten days, all fortresses outside the city were taken. On the twenty-third day of the fourth month, a hundred cannons fired in unison, shattering the gate chains. By the fifth day of the sixth month, His Majesty held a prayer service in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, giving thanks to the Almighty for victory. After this campaign, the eastern frontier was pacified, trade routes opened, and the kingdom's territories expanded further. His Majesty's prestige spread along the Rhine and the Danube, neighboring states all praised or feared it.\n\nFor the Austrians, 'The Defeat of Ostmark' was not merely a military collapse but the end of their old independence and dignity. Elders in the city still whispered of Habsburg glory, while the younger generation learned to march and fight under Lotharingian command.\n\nIn [Root.Capital.GetName], victory bells tolled for three full days, proclaiming the new master of the Danube basin had arrived."

Unlike the city-states of Italy deeply influenced by classical culture, Lotharingia's Renaissance blended the meticulous rigor of Northern Europe with the solemn elegance of Frankish tradition, creating a distinct artistic style. [Root.Monarch.GetName] understood that culture was the cornerstone of the kingdom's enduring stability and placed great emphasis on supporting and nurturing artists. [Root.Capital.GetName] established the Royal Academy of Arts, dedicated to cultivating talents in painting, sculpture, architecture, and music. Here, artists freely explored advanced techniques like anatomy and perspective while incorporating symbolic elements of Lotharingian religion and monarchy, producing numerous works that were both dignified and vibrant.\n\nLotharingian court painters excelled at depicting royal portraits and historical scenes, employing refined oil techniques to capture subtle expressions and light-shade gradations. Sculptors carved statues of saints and warriors, combining strength and grace, which adorned churches and palaces as both visual and spiritual guardians. Simultaneously, architects skillfully blended Gothic spires with Renaissance domes, constructing magnificent cathedrals and palaces that made Aachen one of the most splendid cultural centers in Northern Europe. Composers and musicians created and performed sacred hymns and secular pieces in church cloisters and palace halls, driving musical innovation.\n\nUnder the patronage of [Root.Monarch.GetName], these artists not only shaped the kingdom's cultural identity but also became emissaries showcasing Lotharingia's power and civilization. Envoys and nobles from across Europe came in admiration, marveling that Lotharingia was not only a militarily formidable empire but also a beacon of Renaissance culture."

Many bards and court poets in their works praise this royal lineage, viewing them as guardians of the Christian faith and leaders of civilization. With ornate language, they depict the greatness of the Carolingian house, often likening the blood of Charlemagne flowing through their veins to divine ichor, symbolizing the unshakeable union of divine and royal authority. They wrote:\n\n'That bloodline, descended from Emperor Charlemagne, like sacred light piercing through millennia, imbues the hearts of warriors, granting them strength to defend the faith.'\n'That bloodline from the Holy Emperor Charlemagne, like dawn breaking through shadowed forests, illuminates the glory of Lotharingia, endowing warriors with boundless power and conviction.'\n'On the battlefield, sacred light follows the blade's edge; before the altar, prayer and oath resonate. Carolingian blood flows between sovereign and subjects—God's grace, a sacred covenant on earth.'\n'Through storm and fire, this bloodline remains unstained, unfading, the soul of empire, the foundation of faith, eternally guiding us toward the path of light.'\n\nThe Carolingian descendants are portrayed by poets as God's chosen, bearing a sacred mission to lead Lotharingia toward glory and illumination. Whether donning armor for battle or kneeling in prayer within churches, they embody divine will. These poetic works are widely sung across the kingdom, especially in Aachen's churches and marketplaces, where bards often recite them, deepening the people's loyalty and reverence for the royal house. The poems contain not only praise for the monarchs personally but also hymns to the Christian faith, forming a unique cultural symbol of Lotharingia. Influenced by these verses, Carolingian rule is endowed with extraordinary legitimacy and historical mission—they are not merely the political center but also the symbol of faith, becoming the spiritual pillar of the kingdom's unity and stability."

Minting a new coin—the Livre—could extinguish the flames of inflation and allow us to control coinage, making wealth truly subject to royal authority. His supporters are mostly new nobles and city council representatives, whose fortunes in the past two decades have relied on domestic trade and handicrafts. They know well that old coins' weight carries the vested interests of nobility and guilds. For them, the Livre is not just a currency but a sharp blade to sever the old order.\n\nAnother faction believes the new coin is merely the Treasurer's illusion. The gold écu, minted since the previous king's era and unchanged for a century, is deeply ingrained in merchants' and commoners' hearts. It symbolizes credit and order and has not yet reached the point of being discarded. His supporters are mostly hereditary nobles and old merchant houses, whose wealth is rooted in the old coinage system through its gold and silver content and weight standards. They fear the price fluctuations and redistribution of power brought by reform, and even more, they fear royal authority using new coins to undermine their privileges.\n\nAdditionally, some argue that the florin is the passport of Italian trade routes, the golden key to Mediterranean commerce.

Pilgrims at Rome's stone steps gazed upon the court's banners as if seeing Charlemagne's ancient shadow; in Constantinople's streets, merchants and scholars walked between freedom and order, feeling [Root.GetName]'s protection; across the lands of Rus', villages and castles sounded unified horns in the wind, proclaiming the court's unparalleled prestige.\n\nThe court made East and West shake hands again, made divided peoples reunite, made history's wheel thunder forward on the tracks of unity and peace. People sang in squares, poets recorded in scrolls, and subjects remembered in their hearts: all this glory was due to [Root.GetName]'s wisdom, courage, and benevolence."

EDG_flavorAEL.103.title:0 "Basic Knowledge of In-Game Warfare Mechanics"
EDG_flavorAEL.103.desc:0 "We have detected that you are utilizing the mechanic to 'call allies or subjects into war through special means.' Therefore, we are providing this basic knowledge about the game's mechanics to address potential future confusion:\n\nWhen Country A and Country B have a truce agreement, Country C cannot use special methods to bring Country A into an offensive war against Country B.\n\nFor example, when Arles and Hungary have a truce agreement, the Habsburgs 'cannot by any means' call Hungary into an offensive war.\n\nThus, when your ally or subject (referring to any nation) has a 'truce agreement' with the enemy, they cannot be brought into the war through special methods (such as events, decisions, or other means outside the game's standard mechanics).\n\nDue to game limitations, you may still see text like 'such-and-such country joins the war' in these events or decisions, but the game itself does not allow you to call them in. Please do not be alarmed or mistake this for a bug.\n\nBefore declaring war or calling in allies, please check whether your allies or subjects have a truce with the target. Do not attempt to abuse this mechanic. The mod's new mechanics are designed to enrich your experience, not to be exploited for opportunistic or emotional purposes.\n\nAdditional Reminder: Before the 'Iberian Struggle' concludes, the Iberian region has powerful bonuses and special war declaration mechanics. Please do not blindly interfere in Iberia or annex Iberian provinces before its unification. Iberian nations also cannot call in allies."
