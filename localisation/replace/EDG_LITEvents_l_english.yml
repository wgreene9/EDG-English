EDG_flavor_LIT.0.desc:0 "Sandwiched between the powerful Rus' principalities and the Mongol nomads, Ryazan has struggled to maintain its independence. This has also given its Garrison Council a unique character: numerous Tatar nobles, who gradually became the military backbone after the previous king died in the Oka uprising. Undoubtedly, we despise these antichrist steppe raiders, but like the Cossacks, their distinctive combat style shines on the steppes. Perhaps they are unfit for high office, but as mercenaries, they are undoubtedly excellent. We would benefit greatly if we could bring them under our power structure."

EDG_flavor_LIT.1.desc:0 "The House of Jagiellon has long thrived in Lithuania. As the more bellicose High Dukes, it was the Jagiellons who led armies to recover the southern ancestral lands lost to the Poles for years, just as the Kingdom of Poland crumbled under prolonged internal strife and the impact of the Sandomierz Hussite heresy. The Jagiellons aim to achieve a balance of power between the Empire and Ruthenian settlers, thereby enriching Lithuania's treasury and lands. After Poland's collapse, Casimir Jagiellon seized the opportunity to recover Podlasie, his prestige growing daily. Many hope Casimir could become the new Grand Duke of Lithuania... even [Root.Monarch.GetTitle][Root.Monarch.GetName] himself has considered this option. However, many also believe that while Casimir is an excellent military strategist, he lacks the mind for statecraft and could only serve as a voivode, not as the head of the entire nation. Regardless, our attitude towards Casimir reflects our stance towards the Jagiellons."

EDG_flavor_LIT.2.desc:0 "The Belarussian lands such as Turov and Minsk, once seized by Ivan I of Kiev, have finally been taken by the Lithuanians. However, among the many fragmented powers, the Bronze Council of Minsk stands out: although they consider themselves the regional patriarch, uniting church and state, their promotion of "Ecclesiastical Moral Principles" strictly cracking down on corrupt clergy, has won them widespread support among the local populace and nobility. The Patriarch himself, clad in simple gray robes, is affectionately called the "Gray Patriarch" by the commoners. Now that we have taken over the former Bronze Council, should we accept them and align them with Lithuanian rule, or grant them autonomy? Regardless, the decision is in our hands."

Therefore, the influential merchants and nobles of Novgorod are the true wielders of power in the state, and the Veche is the stage for their influence. As our sovereign crushed the resistance of the Novgorodian princes, the issue of the Civic Veche has increasingly come to the fore. Although they can no longer elect a monarch, integrating their local Veches into the administrative system naturally offers many benefits."

Even before the rebellion of the High Dukes, we were but a pitiable polity whose Belarussian territories had been seized by Kiev. But now, we have defeated the Orders, united the Rus', and driven out the Tatar raiders. Thus, our sovereign is no longer merely the esteemed Grand Duke of Lithuania and Grand Duke of Ruthenia: from this day forth, [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall become the Ruler of All Rus', receiving God's mandate to protect all Slavic peoples. We shall forever rule the lands of Eastern Europe!"

At that time, Ivan I of Kiev rose powerfully, filling the political vacuum left by the retreating Tatars and leaping to become the most powerful Rus' prince, even seizing Turov and Minsk from our country. However, times have changed. The Rus' princes, embroiled in civil war, are no match for Lithuania, and we have successfully seized Volhynia. Yet, managing these unruly boyars is no easy task. Should we pardon their resistance and integrate them into the administrative system, or allow them to retain their former autonomy to remain active in Volhynia?"

Now, we have driven out the Western crusader invaders and swept across the Ruthenian steppes left in the wake of the Golden Horde's collapse, unexpectedly becoming the unifiers of Ruthenia. Our Grand Duke joyfully crowns himself with a new title: 'Grand Duke of All Ruthenia,' to proclaim our dominion over these steppes."

The former Tatar tax collectors have fled in panic, but many members of his professional troops—the Streltsy—remain in Moscow because their previous ruler withheld their pay, land, and uniforms. This is a force not to be underestimated; on the battlefield, our army has repeatedly suffered from their tenacious fighting. Some commanders argue that we should emulate the Rus' and establish our own trained Streltsy units.\nHowever, the Jynys believe that armies reliant on money lack honor and loyalty, as their abandonment by their master is the best proof. Perhaps they could become the next Silver Shields, yet the kind of unwavering, indomitable fighting spirit they possess is something many Jynys cannot achieve."

Regardless of how we treat the Pope's counsel, Algirdas Radziwiłł's ties to Western Europe and his domestic influence cannot be ignored. Already, there are covert efforts to support him in becoming the Grand Duke."

In 1236, after the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, a new Livonian Order was re-established as a branch. Yet, in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the Orders were once again defeated by Lithuania. Since then, the 'Northern Crusades' have never recovered. Now, we have captured the original gem of the Northern Crusades—Riga. We must now decide: should we integrate the bishoprics along the Daugava River into the royal administrative system, or grant them a degree of autonomy to demonstrate the Commonwealth's tolerance and enlightenment?"

However, after Christianizing Prussia, the Teutons did not halt their advance, thus becoming a significant nuisance for Lithuania. After their defeat at Grunwald in 1410, the Teutonic Order never recovered, retreating into their Prussian stronghold. Now, under the combined internal and external pressure from the Prussian Confederation and Lithuania, Prussia has finally fallen into our hands. The Prussian Confederation is willing to accept Lithuanian suzerainty; but whether to integrate Prussia into the Crown or preserve their trade privileges and autonomous status—their fate lies in our hands."

EDG_flavor_LIT.12.desc:0 "In 1253, the 'Leader' Mindaugas was crowned King of Lithuania by the Holy Father, marking the formal establishment of Lithuania in the general sense. However, Mindaugas's conversion was purely political: to avoid the incursions of the Northern Crusades and to crown himself king, placing him on equal footing with rulers from both East and West. Today, the lands of the Western Orders bow to the Lithuanian Crown, and the Rus' in the East have crumbled, posing no threat. We now have the capacity to stand as an independent pole of power.\nSimultaneously, the winds of church reform have seeped into Lithuania's political landscape along the Hussite corridor. It is no secret that our monarch frequently engages with and shelters heretics, but we are far from Rome's reach, and the Pope, reliant on us to resist the Rus' and Mongols, dares not punish us. Yet, in return for our dutiful service, might a Slavic Cardinal even ascend to the Papacy?"
