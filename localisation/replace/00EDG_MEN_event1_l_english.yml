EDG_flavorMEN_mission.6.d:0 "Tonight, the city of Mylasa is unusually lively, for a member of the Eastern Empire's imperial family is not a common sight. The Greeks in the city are thrilled by this royal arrival. Ilyas III's yearning for Rome is well known; his multiple failed pledges of allegiance to Rome in previous years have even become a subject of popular ridicule. Should this Turkic Bey successfully submit, they would soon be Romans once more.\n\nThe visitor is Konstantinos of the Palaiologos family, brother of the late Eastern Emperor Ioannes VIII—a valiant middle-aged man. Ilyas warmly receives this uncle of the Basileus, expressing his own longing for Rome while vehemently condemning the corrupt officials and faded glory of the Empire. Though their meeting is brief, the two become kindred spirits. Konstantinos is accompanied by a young man named Pavlos, who claims to have been rescued by Konstantinos while crossing the Aegean Sea to join his father, making them sworn brothers. After conversing with him, the elder Ilyas realizes this Pavlos is the child he had with a Greek mistress many years ago, now his sole heir in the absence of a legitimate wife or other offspring. Pavlos likewise urges Ilyas to become part of Rome, to repay the imperial family for saving his life. He believes that only by embracing the mission of restoring the Eastern Roman Empire can the perilous state of Orthodoxy be changed. Uniting Greeks discontent with Muslim rule under their banner is the only path forward for the Principality of Mentese, founded on Orthodox faith.\n\nThough the banquet conversation is delightful, Ilyas hesitates to board what seems a doomed ship. Even fragmented, the Ottoman Empire far surpasses the decrepit Rome. Their tolerant religious policies and shared ethnic ties offer a viable alternative through submission. His youthful dream of Rome feels distant; Ioannes VIII and his Greek nobles had rejected the title for this 'barbarian.' Now, with the loss of Morea, the Basileus finally shows interest in his allegiance, but it seems more like Rome seeking to drain his lifeblood as it faces oblivion.

Suddenly, a soft touch made him realize Zoe had stood up and embraced him.\n\n'Come back safely. You can do it, right?' Zoe struggled to draw Ibash's Roman short sword, pointing it northwest of Constantinople—from where the marauding Germans were coming. Her sword hand trembled, tears flowing uncontrollably; clearly, she too was feigning composure.\n\nAt that moment, gazing in the direction Zoe pointed, Ibash seemed to receive some revelation, shedding all prior hesitation.\n\nThe young man departed, leading his army toward the direction the girl had indicated, clutching the short sword that still held a trace of warmth.\n\n'My body belongs to the Empire's people, yet there is no Empire to defend.

EDG_flavorMEN_mission.16.d:0 "On that rainy night when the Constantinople coup occurred, Ibash was bewildered.\n\nAs the youngest son of the Grand Duke of Mentese, he had never contemplated inheritance rights. Under his father's arrangement, he had early on become an attendant to Zoe, the Basileus's youngest daughter. Though called an attendant, he was more of a playmate. The still-childish princess was mischievous, often playing pranks in the imperial palace and pinning them on him, causing him much grief. When he took the blame for others, she would cheekily come to mock him, only to be caught instantly, leaving him laughing heartily at the spectacle of the princess being disciplined by the etiquette minister, furious yet not daring to speak.\n\nBut this farcical life ended today. Fires raged, black smoke billowed, and the sounds of killing filled the entire palace. In his confusion, he encountered his father, covered in wounds.\n\n'I will draw off the pursuers. The boat is ready. You must go and save His Majesty!'\n\nWith that, his father left without looking back, leaving Ibash only with these words and his resolute, desperate silhouette.\n\nYet when Ibash found the Basileus, a flash of lightning split the night sky, illuminating everything—this most esteemed person of the empire had become a corpse, eyes wide open as if alive, the imperial crown symbolizing the empire's lineage fallen to the ground, blood still wet upon it.\n\n'Have I failed even my father's dying wish? If only I had come a little earlier...' Ibash slumped to the ground in despair, tears flowing, his sobs drowned out by the thunder. Only when the thunder ceased did he realize he was not the only one crying. It was Zoe, curled beneath the chair hidden by the Basileus's body, desperately trying to make no sound.\n\n'Your Highness...!' Ibash quickly scooped up Zoe, grabbed the crown from the floor, and mustered all his strength to reach the harbor. By the time they boarded the boat, the young man was utterly exhausted, collapsing unconscious without even removing his armor.\n\nThe wind howled, lightning flashed, and thunder roared. The once frivolous girl, with the most devout posture of her life, prayed to the Lord. The fishing boat trembled as it sailed through the storm, mirroring the fate of Rome."

He invited almost all the Holy Roman nobility to participate in this trial — the centralized power, so hard-won by the Holy Roman Empire, was once again dispersed by Ibash. No sensible German noble would miss a chance to claim their share.\n\nDuring the trial, Ibash neither proposed that the Eastern Empire concurrently hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor nor demanded to become an Elector himself. He merely stripped the condemned on the tribunal of most of their ducal titles, allowed the Orthodox Church to proselytize in Vienna, and integrated Mentese into the Holy Roman Empire. The nobles who gained power were overjoyed, but some of the more astute could only stare helplessly at Ibash.\n\nWhile these measures seemed like nothing more than a lenient treaty of surrender, with such a united, powerful, and fearless imperial member—who dared to judge the emperor and defied the Pope—present, even the emperor was but a caged bird, let alone these petty states. Once this young man, akin to an imperial guardian, consolidates his footing, what recourse would there be, even if imperial authority in the Holy Roman Empire were recentralized?"

These reforms stripped the Areopagus Council, composed of former archons, of its powers, transferring them to the Ecclesia (Assembly), the Heliaea (People's Court), and the Boule (Council of Five Hundred), propelling democracy to a new stage. The military cleruchy system, various public benefactions and stipends for citizens, and extensive construction projects ensured a relatively secure material and cultural life for the majority of small-producer citizens. During Pericles' rule, Athens reached its zenith economically, politically, and culturally, becoming the hegemonic power influencing the Greek world and a major cultural center. Now, under the Grand Duke of Mentese, the Athenians will bear the responsibility for cultural transmission."

EDG_flavorMEN.3.d:0 "Crete, due to its geographical location, became the capital of the slave trade in the Eastern Mediterranean region and, for the same reason, was constantly threatened by various powers. It underwent significant development, becoming a center for maritime trade and artistic creation. After allying with Greek pirates, we took it from the Venetians. Now, under the Grand Duke of Mentese, the Cretans will bear the responsibility for expanding trade."

Since 1309 CE, the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem occupied the city of Rhodes and began fortifying it; the Greeks on the island became their soldiers. This gave the islanders some military understanding; the populace of Rhodes is a powerful logistical force. Now, under the Grand Duke of Mentese, the Cretans will bear the responsibility for military logistics."

EDG_flavorMEN.100.d:0 "Recalling the past, Ilyas III had repeatedly petitioned the Byzantine Basileus Ioannes VIII to pledge allegiance, yet the timid Greek nobles rejected him time and again—perhaps fearing this outsider would seize power, or perhaps fearing to provoke the rising behemoth, the Ottomans. Now, he could only lament the destruction these insects have wrought upon Rome.\n\nDespite the constant wars surrounding it, the Aegean's nightscape remains profoundly beautiful, with merchants of all kinds still pursuing their interests here. But Ilyas III had no mood to admire the scenery; he retired early. Approaching his seventies, his mental state was not what it used to be. He could no longer drink wine heartily as in his youth, and his longing for Rome gradually burned out with age.\n\nIn his dream, he arrived in Classical Rome, becoming a glorious Roman general, battling various barbarians, displaying true heroism. In this haze, he lived an extraordinary life. Just as he was about to achieve fame and enjoy his twilight years, he awoke with regret—he was an unrecognized duke, and Rome was reduced to Constantinople alone."

EDG_flavorMEN.101.t:0 "Mentese Playthrough Notes"
EDG_flavorMEN.101.d:0 "§R'Only through bloody struggle to the end is there a glimmer of hope.'§!\nHere are the notes:\n1. The first phase of missions primarily focus on expansion, reform, and disaster. The disaster is triggered by the death of the Eastern Empire's starting emperor, 'Andronikos'.\n2. After triggering the disaster, you will be forced to complete the prerequisite missions for the disaster line (i.e., row 17). The events listed in the disaster mission conditions will all occur, but in a certain order. Disaster events will provide some hints. §RAdditionally, do not actively seek peace or accept peace treaties during the wars triggered by disaster events (you can make separate peace with non-war leaders).§! No further spoilers here; please experience it yourself.\n3. During the disaster, please do not use console commands to annex countries. As mentioned, the disaster has a specific sequence; using console annexation may break it. Surviving the disaster 'Cut Down in Mid-Course' unlocks the next phase of the mission tree.\n4. Please ensure the special subject 'Glorious City-State' has only one province; otherwise, it may block missions. The mission trees for the city-state nations specified in decisions have been adjusted and will not interfere with the player's missions.\n5. A significant portion of the first phase of missions require being a subject of Eastern Rome to complete. This subject type is similar to a tributary; you can form alliances, §Rbut due to game hardcode, you cannot form alliances during a truce with your overlord§!, so time your alliances carefully.\n6. Do not actively declare independence from Byzantium; you are responsible for any blocked missions. §RByzantium will actively declare war on neighboring countries; you can use this to fulfill territorial acquisition needs, provided you act fast enough.§!\n7. Before playing, please review the mission tree once to understand the general flow.\n8. If you start the game rivaled by Smyrna and Smyrna allies with the Eastern Empire, for a smoother mission tree experience, restarting is recommended.\n9. Try to avoid putting your ruler in command of armies; in practice, Ilyas III is very prone to sudden death.\n10. Wishing you an enjoyable and pleasant playthrough."

Yet Ibash's heart was more anxious than the day he fled the palace with Zoe—Zoe had entered the purple birthing chamber, and he was about to become a father.\n\nA flash of lightning illuminated the area outside the chamber, followed by rolling thunder and the cry of an infant. Soon, the attending midwife opened the door. The child's mother, exhausted from the night's labor, had fallen asleep. Ibash rushed in eagerly, yet feared disturbing Zoe's rest.\n\nThe young emperor took his child from the midwife's hands. The unbaptized child wailed, the cries strong and vigorous, not due to the thunder outside but more like a proclamation of his existence to the world.\n\nThough the storm still raged, utterly disregarding this tender scene, under this emperor's presence, it seemed to become a blessed accompaniment. Ibash gazed deeply at his child. He knew his child's name would one day resound throughout the world. Lifting his child high, he declared:\n\n'One day, my life will reach its end, and you, shall be crowned king!'"
