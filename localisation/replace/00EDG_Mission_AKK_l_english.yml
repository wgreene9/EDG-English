EDG_mission_AKK_1_4_desc:0 "The Padishah of Islam asked them: 'Who am I?'\nThey replied: 'You are Uzun Hasan, Lord of the Auspicious Conjunction, son of Shah Hasan 'Ali, grandson of Amir Kara Osman, descendant of Bayandur Khan, the most legitimate heir of Oghuz Khan, inheritor of the blood of the Roman Imperial family.'\nHe asked again: 'Who is the father of the Mamluk leaders?'\nAll of them fell silent. For they understood that these Mamluks had seized the throne not by merit, but by accident, and that they were all servants of the descendants of Oghuz Khan.\n\n\nThe Mamluks are the basest of Turks, the natural slaves of the truly noble Turks—the Turkomans. Now, these slaves, merely by a twist of fortune, presume to be equals of their masters. We shall make them understand with their blood how laughable this notion is."

He brushed the locks of Damascus with his banner, he adorned the cheeks of Egypt, he embellished the land of Iran, so that Isfahan became his eyeliner and Shiraz his beauty spot.'\nPoetry is a powerful weapon; it can be used to extol the ruler's fame and belittle the monarchs of other lands. As advised by the 12th-century writer Nezami 'Aruzi Samarqandi in his 'Four Discourses' (Chahar Maqala), the poet and panegyrist are one of the four indispensable advisors to a ruler. Let us encourage cultural development within our realm, and through these verses, immortalize the Shahanshah."

The World Tree is the shadow of his lofty branches; before his might, all else becomes insignificant. In generosity and charity, he possesses the virtues of Ali; he is the Amir of the Arabs and a luminary of Persia.'\nUzun Hasan is the ninth ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu. Within him flows the two noblest bloodlines in the world: that of Oghuz Khan and that of the Roman Imperial family. His strength and his majesty are innate; he is destined to become the ruler of all Iran, of the entire world."

Therefore, the Prophet Muhammad called upon his followers to realize the political order of the sacred society implied by this covenant in the world, according to the divine law in the revealed Book and the norms established by his own words and deeds. The Prophet endowed this temporal community—the Ummah—with lasting legitimacy and responsibility.\nThe Muslim community—the Ummah—has been divided for too long, and after the coming of the Mongols, it was nearly shattered into fragments. As the Padishah of Islam, the Caliph of Allah, the All-Victorious Sultan of generosity and excellence, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is duty-bound to undertake the mission of unifying the fragmented Ummah community."

There, they split internally, with one branch led by Nur Sufi, the father of Karaman Bey, establishing the Beylik of Karaman after the Babai revolt.\nFor so many years they have continuously fragmented and quarreled.

We are his descendants, of the bloodline of Afrasiab.'\nThe Seljuks gained fame by betraying their tribal followers, but they received their retribution: the Seljuk dynasty ruling Iran declined through constant internal strife and met its ultimate demise due to the famous rebellion launched by the Timurid Turks of Central Asia—they captured and imprisoned Sultan Sanjar and attacked his empire. And in Anatolia, Oghuz dispatched the Mongols as his wrath to humiliate and destroy the Sultanate of Rûm.\nWe shall learn from their lesson; we will not repeat the mistakes of this community that lost divine favor.
