EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_1_12_desc:0 "In the late 13th century, the Khorasani Haji Baktash (a-Hajj Baktash, ?-1335 or 1337) founded the Bektashi Order. After the Mongol westward campaigns, a group of Turks migrated west to Anatolia, where the order spread and became active. In 1444, Mehmed 'the Conqueror's' uncle, Ibrahim, allied with the Bektashi Order, conspired with some Janissaries to stage a mutiny and attempted to usurp the throne. However, the astute Sultan had preemptively summoned provincial troops to the capital. Prince Ibrahim could only flee east to Sinop and establish himself there. Now that Prince Ibrahim has been eliminated, the Janissaries and the Bektashi Order once again bow before us. Let us show the magnanimity of the victor, forgive past grievances, and allow the Bektashi dervishes to educate our Janissaries on how to serve their sovereign."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_1_13_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of the Janissary corps significantly impacted its structure. The primary recruitment method gradually lost dominance as rules permitting marriage were relaxed, and the sons of Janissaries became a preferred source of recruitment. Although the Devshirme practice continued until the mid-18th century, the Kul Oglu became the main manpower source for the corps. Interestingly, even the Kul Oglu could not meet the corps' demand for soldiers. The government had to recruit from other groups, primarily including the unemployed in cities, surplus members of trade guilds, and recent immigrants from rural areas—sources considered unreliable in the classical period. Additionally, volunteers known as 'Kardesh-i Kul' were often recruited, a term sometimes used interchangeably with 'apprentice.' Volunteers were promised that after three years of meritorious service, they could join the Janissary corps. Thus, manpower sources shifted from the provinces to urban centers."

This date is regarded as the inception of the Mehter band. However, the true establishment of Mehter was in 1299. Historical records state that the Sultan of Rum, Kaykhusraw III, conferred upon Osman Gazi the title of 'Bey' and bestowed upon him a kettledrum and plumes, symbols of rank and sovereignty. The Mehter band later became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire, until Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and disbanded the band in 1826."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_1_22_desc:0 "Mehmed 'the Conqueror' was quite willing to let the newly appointed Patriarch of Konstantiniyye regard him as the benefactor and protector of the Greek Orthodox Church, creating a sharp contrast with the Roman Pope. The new Patriarch's power and prestige surpassed that of any Patriarch since the late Byzantine Empire, almost attaining a status equivalent to that of a 'Greek Pope.' This precisely confirmed the once-popular saying: 'Better the Sultan's turban than the Pope's tiara!'\n\nMehmed established a close relationship with Patriarch Gennadius, often engaging in friendly discussions on theology. Driven by a thirst for knowledge, Mehmed also showed a keen interest in Christian doctrines. At his request, Gennadius wrote an introduction to Orthodox beliefs, which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] then had translated into Turkish. This gave the Western world a vain hope: perhaps the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] might convert to Christianity.\n\nAfter the fall of Konstantiniyye, a renowned Italian Hellenist named Francesco Filelfo wrote to Mehmed 'the Conqueror,' pleading for the release of his mother-in-law—an Italian widow of a Greek philosopher—captured in Konstantiniyye. In his letter, he flattered Mehmed obsequiously and expressed hope for Mehmed's conversion to Christianity.\n\nIt is also said that in correspondence with Pope Nicholas V, Mehmed styled himself as the heir and avenger of Hector and gave hints that he might convert to Christianity. Consequently, Pope Nicholas V actually prayed for Mehmed's conversion. More credibly, the later Pope Pius II, fearing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] might lean towards Orthodox doctrines, wrote to him elaborating on the superiority of Catholic wisdom and truth, offering to baptize him and make him the greatest monarch under papal protection in the Christian world.\n\nMeanwhile, within Konstantiniyye itself, a Greek philosopher named George Amiroutzes wrote a treatise for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], emphasizing the commonalities between Islam and Christianity and suggesting merging the two religions into one, or at least recognizing each other as fraternal faiths."

Culturally, he favored Eastern culture over Western culture, particularly enamored with Persian culture, even showing interest in Persian Sharia and its dervish brotherhoods.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, a state adhering to orthodox Islamic tenets, there is a proverb: 'Whoever reads the writings of the Persians loses half his faith.' Yet, Mehmed still read Persian works and displayed particular favor towards the Persians. His affection for the Persians first manifested among intellectuals, then in the administrative sphere, even arousing Turkish jealousy.

After the conquest of Konstantiniyye, with the expansion of state territory and rule, the original codes could no longer address emerging practical issues, leading Mehmed II 'the Conqueror' to issue secular decrees (Kanunnâme).\n\nFor the Ottoman Empire, Islamic law was the written constitution, unchangeable, only subject to minor adjustments and interpretations by jurists. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could not modify Islamic law but could only guide, interpret, and enforce it. The old codes could be reformed and adjusted, but the entire legislative system could not be altered. The codes covered military, financial, Timar (fiefdom), criminal, police, and ceremonial law. These codes were encompassed within Islamic law, with the only exceptions being Timar law and ceremonial law, which did not exist in the classical Islamic legal era and could be modified by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] at will.\n\nSuleiman's legislation was not limited to codes. Suleiman was called 'the Lawgiver' in comparison to his predecessors—most of whom were swordsmen rather than penmen, speaking little and doing much, building a vast empire. The empire's institutions evolved gradually. Although the empire expanded, there were no written laws and decrees, and many significant events went unrecorded. By the time Suleiman I ascended, the Timar system had varying tax methods, and land tenancy was in chaos. Criminal law needed further refinement, urban markets required regulation, and guild rules needed revision.\n\nAccording to the needs of the era, Suleiman I issued a large number of laws, especially concerning Timar, subjects, ceremonies, crime, market rules, and the drafting of the Egyptian Kanunnâme (the code promulgated by Ibrahim in Egypt)."

Members underwent periodic evaluation and review. This new army, known in Turkish as the 'Janissaries,' was primarily recruited from Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Serbs, and Bosniaks (later including Romanians, Georgians, South Russians, Poles, and Armenians).

One boy per family was taken, excluding Jews, children of merchants and artisans, and the married, though various exceptions were seen in practice. Once recruited, the boys were registered and sent collectively to Konstantiniyye for further training. To learn Turkish, they were also assigned to rural villages for training, during which they received government wages. After completing rural training, they returned to Konstantiniyye, entered the reserves, and joined the Janissary corps.

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_2_21_title:0 "Appoint the Patriarch" # Appoint the Ecumenical Patriarch
EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_2_21_desc:0 "Mehmed 'the Conqueror' showed favor to the Greek community in Konstantiniyye, the largest, wealthiest, and most cultured non-Muslim group. He clearly saw the Greeks as an asset to his empire, possessing talents in craftsmanship, commerce, and navigation that the Turks lacked.\n\nFurthermore, Mehmed held Greek scholarship in high regard. Concerned for the Greeks, he immediately appointed a new Patriarch for the Greek Church—the old Patriarch had fled to Italy in 1451, effectively abdicating. Mehmed's chosen candidate was the esteemed scholar Gennadius, also known as George Scholarius. Before the siege of Konstantiniyye began, the Greek and Roman churches had attempted union in exchange for Western Christian aid to the city, and Gennadius had been a leading opponent of this union. Therefore, Gennadius was unlikely to collude secretly with Western Christians.\n\nWhen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] summoned Gennadius, he found that Gennadius had been captured from his monastic cell during the city's fall and sold as a slave to a wealthy Turk who appreciated his erudition. After being ransomed, Gennadius was brought before Mehmed 'the Conqueror.' Mehmed treated him with great courtesy, persuaded him to accept the Patriarchate, and discussed systematic arrangements for governing the Orthodox community with him. Mehmed's arrangements, at least in principle, guaranteed the Orthodox self-determination in religious and some secular affairs, ensuring they would not be interfered with or persecuted. Thus, with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s recommendation, Gennadius's appointment as Patriarch was confirmed by the Holy Synod.\n\nIn January 1454, Gennadius was formally inaugurated as the Greek Patriarch; the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] exercised the former Byzantine emperor's privilege by endorsing the appointment. The ceremony largely followed traditional forms. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally presented Gennadius with the symbols of the Patriarchate—the robes, the pastoral staff, and a new silver-gilt pectoral cross (as the old one was lost). Then, he recited a prayer to Gennadius, saying: 'Grant good fortune to the Patriarch. May our friendship endure, and may you possess all the privileges enjoyed by Patriarchs throughout the ages.' Gennadius was granted jurisdiction over all Byzantine Orthodox communities in Rumelia and was also conferred the honorary title of three-tailed Pasha.\n\nMoreover, in the Phanar district of the city belonging to the Greeks, Gennadius had his own civil court and prison. Since the Hagia Sophia had been converted into a mosque, ordinations and coronations were held at the Church of the Holy Apostles. Mehmed specifically ordered that this church not be destroyed, reserving it for use as the Patriarchal cathedral.\n\nAfter receiving a generous bounty from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the newly appointed Patriarch paraded through the streets on a fine white horse (also a gift from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]) and subsequently took up residence near the Church of the Holy Apostles."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_2_22_title:0 "Mosque Conversion"
EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_2_22_desc:0 "Mehmed began rebuilding and reinforcing the walls of Konstantiniyye. He was determined to ensure the imperial capital achieved architectural glory no less than that of any era of the Byzantine Empire, worthy of the Ottoman Empire—the nation originating from the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum—and its boundless honor. He also seized every moment to build his own mosque—which people called the Fatih Mosque, the Mosque of the Conqueror.\n\nHe chose a Greek architect and sited the mosque at the location of the Church of the Holy Apostles. He demolished the Church of the Holy Apostles and used its materials to construct his mosque, while the Greek Patriarchal cathedral was relocated to the Church of Pammakaristos in the Phanar district, the Greek quarter overlooking the Golden Horn. Mehmed claimed that, including its surrounding areas, his mosque's total area surpassed that of the Hagia Sophia Mosque. The Fatih Mosque, rising on the western side of the promontory between the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn, became the first mosque with a grand dome in that area; over the following centuries, a series of grand-domed mosques were built, giving Konstantiniyye a new skyline. Although the architectural inspiration originally came from the Byzantine style of the Hagia Sophia, from an Islamic civilization perspective, it embodied the grand imperial vision of a new nation whose Muslim metropolis would ultimately surpass the Christian one. Mehmed also personally laid the foundation for the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, built to commemorate the Prophet Muhammad's companion Eyüp. Eyüp had died beneath the walls of Konstantiniyye, and his tomb was discovered by the Turks during Mehmed II's siege.\n\nFurthermore, since the Byzantine imperial palaces were in ruins and their scale did not meet Mehmed's expectations, he expanded the Pantokrator Monastery at the center of the promontory into his own palace and constructed several new, well-paved roads around it to improve nearby transportation. In the future, he would move here from Edirne. Like his other construction projects, Mehmed paid close attention to these works; during his 25-year reign, he typically oversaw the progress personally in the winter months—the several-month truce period between annual campaigning seasons."

He aimed to defeat the Western world and become 'the master of two continents (Rumelia and Anatolia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea).' Capturing Konstantiniyye was a great feat not accomplished by previous caliphs. He saw his dynasty as a continuation of the grand Islamic history, and after fulfilling the sacred mission of capturing Konstantiniyye, he was exalted as the greatest monarch since the first four Rightly Guided Caliphs in Islamic history.\n\nMehmed saw himself as a ruler combining the identities of Khan, Gazi, and Roman Caesar, inheriting Turkic, Islamic, and Byzantine traditions. Therefore, he had to transform Konstantiniyye into the center of this world and this empire. The Janissaries also supported the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s great enterprise, praising his valor and might, though their support was partly motivated by the benefits gained from military conquest. Some Greek generals of the Byzantine Empire also discerned possibilities within the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ambitions; some Greek officers knelt before the Sublime Porte, begging for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favor."

As a 'wise and great monarch who loves Greek culture,' Mehmed was naturally fascinated by the classical ruins of Athens. He particularly admired the Acropolis. He treated the Athenians with great generosity, confirming their civil liberties and tax exemptions. What especially delighted the Athenians was that after the local Latin church dissolved, the Sultan granted numerous privileges to the Orthodox clergy. The Ottoman peace replaced the prolonged internal conflicts of the Franks, and the Greeks received a degree of preferential treatment—they were not burdened with excessive taxes, did not have to give their children to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as soldiers, and enjoyed trade freedom and the freedom to elect local governments. The imperial government's tolerance led the Greeks to view the empire as their ally, providing greater support—even more than they had given the Byzantine Empire."

Thus, the Grand Vizier became the head of government, wielding the state seal.\n\nAs the deputy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Grand Vizier obtained broad secular authority, responsible for managing various administrative affairs, supervising appointments and removals, and evaluating the performance of bureaucrats. Mehmed's Grand Vizier became the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s steward and a loyal instrument for executing the monarch's commands. The Grand Vizier had no power to make major state decisions but could issue orders within his jurisdiction, his authority surpassing that of previous Grand Viziers.\n\nBefore Mehmed, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would typically attend the Divan in person, sitting in his seat during state council meetings, much like his nomadic ancestors conducting business in tents for centuries. However, during his reign, Mehmed gradually transferred this authority to his Grand Vizier. He no longer frequently attended Divan meetings but observed them from a grilled room—called 'the Sultan's Eye'—looking down upon them while remaining unseen himself.

She gradually replaced Gülbahar (meaning 'Spring Rose') as the new favorite of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In matters of state, she also supplanted Ibrahim's position and likely contributed to his death.\n\nShe was slender and graceful, her charm stemming more from her delightful personality than her beauty. She used her charm to soothe and her vivacity to motivate. Perceptive and clever, Roxelana could divine Suleiman's thoughts and skillfully guide his actions to satisfy her own thirst for power. After becoming pregnant with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s child, Roxelana managed to secure for herself the status of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s legal wife under Islamic law, establishing a marital relationship with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]—a status no concubine of an Ottoman [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had attained in the past two centuries.\n\nAround 1541, when the old palace housing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s consorts was destroyed by fire, Roxelana set another precedent by moving into the Great Saray (Topkapi Palace) where the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] resided and conducted state affairs. She moved into the Great Saray with her possessions and a large entourage, including 100 maids and several personal tailors; even her food suppliers brought 30 slaves. By convention, women were not allowed to stay overnight in the Great Saray, yet Roxelana spent the rest of her life there. In the secluded courtyards of the Great Saray, a new harem was constructed, replacing the old one.\n\nAfter Ibrahim's execution, Roxelana spent seven years eventually becoming the most influential person around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]—she managed to have Rüstem Pasha appointed Grand Vizier. Rüstem Pasha married Mihrimah, the daughter of Roxelana and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], making him Suleiman's son-in-law (while Ibrahim had been Suleiman's brother-in-law). Rüstem Pasha, somber and diligent, was an outstanding administrator, particularly in financial matters. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] gradually transferred more government authority to Rüstem Pasha, Roxelana correspondingly approached the peak of her power.\n\nThough Suleiman was tolerant, just, and emotional, there was an ugly coldness within him. He was inherently obsessed with absolute power and suspicious of anyone who might threaten it. And Roxelana knew well how to exploit this aspect of Suleiman's character."

EDG_Mission_TUR_reform_3_12_desc:0 "As in previous reigns of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], each Sanjak province was further subdivided into fiefs of varying sizes (known as 'Ziamet' and 'Timar'). These fiefs were granted to cavalrymen (Sipahis) from Turkish families, who obtained certain rights to manage local peasants.\n\nThe Sipahi cavalry was a crucial component of the empire's armed forces. They had to be ready at all times to muster a specified number of soldiers as required by the Sanjak Bey, arm them, and participate in war. Sipahis failing to do so would be stripped of their fiefs. Unlike in the West, this fief system was not hereditary. Upon a Sipahi's death, his son would receive only a small portion of the fief; he had to earn more land through his performance on the battlefield.\n\nThe Timar system was created to support a vast imperial army on a medieval economic foundation. This already extensive and continually expanding institutional system gradually became the mainstay of the imperial administrative system, aiming to utilize all fiscal, social, and agricultural policies to meet the empire's military needs. This system resulted in a 'fragmented ownership,' where the state, the Sipahis, and the peasants each enjoyed and bore part of the rights and obligations arising from the land. The state owned the land; the Sipahis, authorized by the state, could derive a certain income from the peasants in return for the military services they and their men provided; the peasants, known as 'Reaya,' were responsible for cultivating the land, possessing the right to use it. After paying taxes and providing labor, they could use the land's produce to support their families. Upon a peasant's death, his land could be passed to his son.\n\nThus, under Mehmed II's rule, the empire established a well-organized, coordinated, and strictly regulated feudal structure.

Dilaver Pasha was the governor of the vast Diyarbakir province, commanding respect in this martial region. According to the plan, he would, with the help of other nearby provincial governors, recruit a large Asian army from the hardy local population to serve as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s new militia, counterbalancing the standing army in Konstantiniyye.

Both Anatolia and Rumelia were further subdivided into more districts (Sanjaks), each administered by a military commander called a Sanjak Bey.

It is essentially a form of 'waqf' (charitable endowment), an institution combining religious, cultural, and commercial functions. Some Imarets were established by the state, others by private individuals, but all required state recognition and were under state control. An Imaret included a series of public buildings centered around a mosque, comprising advanced religious schools, hospitals, and inns for travelers, as well as revenue-generating facilities like hostels, markets, caravanserais, mills, public baths, dye houses, warehouses, slaughterhouses, and soup kitchens. The income from these public buildings supplemented religious endowments, funding the operation of other non-profit facilities.\n\nMehmed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] commanded the community leaders of the empire to also build Imarets in other parts of Konstantiniyye, making them centers of new residential districts. As trade increased, Konstantiniyye's commercial status gradually rose, eventually surpassing Bursa and Adrianople to become the empire's trade hub, once again a commercial nexus controlling routes between the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Asian mainland.

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_3_26_desc:0 "The administrative system governed by the Grand Vizier in the name of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] rested upon the 'Four Pillars of the Empire.' This term originated from military parlance, originally referring to the four poles of early Ottoman rulers' tents. The number 'four' holds sacred significance, symbolizing the four angels supporting the throne mentioned in the Quran, the Prophet Muhammad's four companions—the later Rightly Guided Caliphs—and the four winds of paradise.\n\nThe first pillar, of course, was the Grand Vizier himself. Like other high officials, the Grand Vizier held the honorary title 'Pasha,' meaning 'the foot of the Shah.' This mode of address resembles ancient Persian practice, where officials were often called the king's eyes and hands. The Grand Vizier enjoyed the privilege of bearing the Pasha's banner decorated with five horse-tails, while his three fellow Viziers could only have three tails. This symbol originated from the era of Turkic nomads on the steppes. The other three Viziers were responsible for administrative, legal, and financial affairs respectively, possessing a degree of autonomy within their departments but reporting directly to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself.\n\nThe second pillar consisted of two 'Kazaskers,' or military judges, overseeing judicial matters. One handled Anatolia, the other Rumelia, primarily responsible for nominating other judges.\n\nThe third pillar comprised four 'Defterdars,' literally accountants or bookkeepers, serving as state treasurers managing financial and fiscal affairs.\n\nThe final pillar was the 'Nishanci,' the state assistant and secretary, responsible for drafting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s edicts and affixing the imperial seal—the 'Tugra' or 'Nishan.'\n\nAdditionally, there were officers or officials called 'Aghas.' Aghas were of two types: external, holding military posts such as the Agha of the Janissaries; and internal, serving exclusively in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s court.\n\nThis system, modified and perfected by Mehmed 'the Conqueror,' was recorded in the 'Kanunnâme,' or 'Book of Laws.' The term 'Kanunnâme' derives from the Greek 'kanon' and Arabic 'kanun,' meaning 'law book.' Towards the end of Mehmed's reign, he ordered the compilation of this book, assembling laws and regulations that documented the Ottoman state's hierarchy, customs, ceremonial requirements, office duties, organizational structures, and reward and punishment systems."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_3_31_title:0 "Seeds of Decline"
EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_3_31_desc:0 "Beneath the various manifestations of the Ottoman Empire's decline lay a disorder in its social and economic foundations.\n\nFirst, the population growth of the Ottoman Empire outpaced the increase in arable land.\n\nSecond, after vast quantities of gold and silver poured in from the Spanish Americas of the New World, severe price inflation erupted within the empire. The massive inflow of precious metals led to the devaluation of Ottoman silver coins, causing serious inflation—a phenomenon also common along the European Mediterranean coast at the time. Faced with the ensuing economic crisis, the Ottoman government had no choice but to manipulate currency values in 1584, following Persia's example. Gold coins were devalued by 50%, while the standard silver coin, the Akçe, used for military pay, was melted down and recast into thinner coins with more copper added. In the words of a contemporary Turkish historian, these coins were 'as thin as apricot leaves and as worthless as dew.' Currency devaluation continued relentlessly; the Spanish ambassador to Venice even reported to Philip II: 'The Ottoman Empire is very poor, its resources exhausted, and the only currency still circulating is the Akçe, made entirely of iron.'\n\nAt the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman Empire encountered successive economic crises and was economically feeble. Even if not bankrupt, it frequently struggled to pay military salaries. Domestic discontent grew increasingly intense, while the central government's authority waned daily, unable to control domestic demonstrations, rebellions, and riots.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the empire's total population doubled. Under population pressure, the empire launched conquests in Europe but achieved little. Consequently, there was insufficient land to accommodate the surplus population. Due to the scarcity of land relative to people, young villagers had to leave their homes to seek livelihoods elsewhere.\n\nBeyond extracting resources from the land, the Ottoman government and its medieval-style traditional guild system were incapable of developing new economic resources. Only the conquest of Cyprus provided some settlement opportunities, with no similar prospects elsewhere. Particularly in Anatolia, landless, wandering peasants were everywhere, hoping to find opportunities to serve as irregular soldiers for the state or obtain other employment from the government. If they found no work, they often incited riots and frequently engaged in banditry. Currency devaluation also led to a series of issues: prices doubled, counterfeit money proliferated, speculation ran rampant, interest rates soared, usury flourished—all exacerbating the plight of the unemployed masses."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_4_12_title:0 "Strengthen the Sipahis"
EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_4_12_desc:0 "Sipahis, also known as Spahis, derive their name from the Persian word 'sepah,' meaning 'army.' The Sipahis were the Ottoman Empire's military feudal cavalry (i.e., troops maintained through land grants rather than salaries), their status equivalent to European feudal knights, though unlike in Europe, their land was not hereditary. Together with the later Janissaries, they formed the empire's standing main army, the two great military pillars of the Turks.\n\nSince the Ottomans were originally a nomadic people, dating back to the Seljuk era, they had already adopted the Sipahi system of fief-based cavalry for military organization. At that time, the Ottomans divided their territory into numerous fiefs (Dirlik), granting them to princes, ministers, and meritorious soldiers. These 'Dirlik' could be classified into three different grades based on the income from the fief. All holders of 'Dirlik' (regardless of grade) were obligated to provide the Sultan with fully armed cavalry as the price for receiving the fief.\n\nAs Ottoman power expanded, the Dirlik system was extended to newly conquered territories, and the number of Sipahis grew, gradually forming the mainstay of the Ottoman military. When the Ottoman Sultan 'the Lightning' Bayezid I swept across the Anatolian Turkish beyliks, it was this army he relied upon."

Provincial standing armies are called 'Seyhülkulu,' meaning 'Servants of the Governors.'\n\nThe empire is vast, and the Seyhülkulu vary across regions. For instance, the poor and turbulent Anatolian region primarily has 'Azab' troops, whose weapons are provided by the governors. Those enlisting are exempt from taxes and receive service allowances during wartime, but the Azab, with insufficient equipment and training, have always lacked combat effectiveness. While the central Kapikulu corps include elite units like the Janissaries, the provincial Seyhülkulu also have powerful elite forces. The 'Deli' cavalry from the Balkan region are a valiant and skilled cavalry corps, the strongest of the Seyhülkulu.\n\nLike the Janissaries, the vast majority of Deli cavalry are former infidels converted to Islam, receiving comprehensive military training and possessing high combat proficiency. The Deli corps receive service allowances, are extremely loyal to the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], fearless in battle with strong fighting spirit, high mobility, and agility. They wear minimal armor but carry large cavalry shields. Even if wounded in battle, they do not flee but use their wounds to intimidate the enemy, continuing their frenzied charges, once called 'mad horsemen.' Deli cavalry sometimes wear decorations resembling black bird wings, leading some Poles to call them the winged hussars of the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire.\n\nWith our successful expansion in the Balkan region, more and more Deli corps have come into our view."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_4_14_title:0 "Royal Hussars"

However, their numbers later expanded to corps size, and they distinguished themselves greatly at the Battle of Varna and the Battle of Kosovo. Some even say one reason King Władysław III of Poland fell from his horse and was killed was because his horse was frightened by the Deli cavalry. Mahmud Pasha separated the command structures of the Sipahis and the Deli cavalry, with the latter being trained by various Sanjak Beys.

A particularly crucial aspect of this was increasing the city's population.\n\nPrior to this, as the city grew increasingly isolated and its importance declined, its population had dwindled to 30,000-40,000. Vast areas within the city were uninhabited. To make matters worse, the Ottoman siege left the city in ruins, with palaces and other grand buildings reduced to rubble. Now, the Ottomans swiftly cleared debris from the streets, repaired the walls, and established new administrative organs in the Ottoman manner. The Ottoman Empire called upon the fleeing residents (mostly Orthodox Christians) to return immediately, promising to protect their property, respect their faith, and exempt them from taxes. The government frequently assisted in rebuilding their homes and shops. Captives taken by the Ottoman army were released and settled in the Phanar district, enjoying tax exemptions for a period.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] also commanded the governors of Rumelia and Anatolia to each send 4,000 households—whether Christian or Muslim—to Konstantiniyye to occupy abandoned houses. Approximately 30,000 peasants captured in various campaigns were also sent to settle in depopulated villages near Konstantiniyye to provide food for the city. By the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s order, each conquered city was to select a number of wealthy individuals, merchants, and artisans to send to Konstantiniyye to promote its commerce and handicrafts. Many migrants came from [148.GetName], which had a large Jewish population, and many Jews also arrived from Europe. Within 25 years, Jews under their own community leaders became the third largest group in Konstantiniyye, after Muslims and Christians.\n\nWith Mehmed's subsequent campaigns, another 5,000 households were relocated from Trebizond and its surroundings, with additional settlers coming from Anatolia, Morea, and the Aegean islands. In Konstantiniyye, people from the same origin were settled together, and their new districts were named after their places of origin, such as 'Aksaray' or 'Karamanlia.' Besides nobles, migrants included small shopkeepers and numerous artisans and stonemasons, who accelerated the city's reconstruction. Gradually, as the city grew more prosperous, Greeks began voluntarily migrating to Konstantiniyye, hoping to prosper like the Jews and Armenians.\n\n'The city of Konstantiniyye is truly strange,' wrote a Turkish author shortly after its capture. 'For just a copper coin, one can be rowed from Rumelia to Frankistan.' By the middle of Mehmed 'the Conqueror's' reign, Konstantiniyye had already become a flourishing city again. Workshops and markets were everywhere, handicrafts thrived, and the population, mixed from various ethnicities, was three to four times larger than at the time of conquest. In less than a century, Konstantiniyye's population reached 500,000, with Turks only slightly exceeding half."

Particularly Bursa, located at the terminus of the Silk Road caravan route from Persia, became a cosmopolitan commodity distribution center, including spices from India and Arabia via Damascus. These goods were transported via two routes: one overland through Anatolia via Adana and Konya; the other by sea from Egyptian and Syrian ports to Antalya and Alanya, from where Anatolian iron ore and other goods were exported to Egypt.

It stood on the site of the Byzantine acropolis, a promontory controlling three seas (the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus, and the Sea of Marmara)—later known as Saray Point.\n\nIn 1465, Mehmed began constructing a palace at this strategic location. This grand project was overseen by Persian, Arabic, and Greek architects, initially estimated to take 25 years to complete.

If we wish to enhance the trust of new subjects in the empire, the best method is to demonstrate that we have sufficient reserve funds at our disposal, proving our financial ability to continue great conquests."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_5_28_desc:0 "The Akçe was the primary currency unit of the Ottoman Empire. Three Akçe equaled one Para; 120 Akçe equaled one Kurush. Later, the Kurush gradually replaced the Akçe as the main currency unit. Finally, in 1843, the Kurush and gold coins formed the Turkish Lira using a bimetallic standard."

EDG_MISSION_TUR_reform_5_29_desc:0 "The evolution of the guild system, increased urbanization, and the growth of market facilities reflected the entry of the fully-fledged Ottoman Empire into a new stage of economic development. This was also evident in the rapid increase of trade with the West.\n\nIn the last decades of the 15th century, trade had become a significant part of Ottoman relations with European states. With the Byzantine Empire gone and truly threatening Crusades a thing of the past, the Ottoman Empire spontaneously rose as a major trade center. It became a crucial link in Eurasian trade, expanding economic exchanges between the two continents while also influencing social and cultural interactions between these two worlds. Whereas Byzantine-era economic activities were dominated by the Venetians, the multiethnic, thriving Ottoman society established equal trade relations with all nations under a protective tariff system.\n\nOver time, Ottoman merchants gradually penetrated from Eastern Europe into Central Europe and even as far as Northern Europe, opening large establishments in important cities and developing their own credit system. They exchanged Eastern agricultural and handicraft products for Western raw materials like weapons and minerals."
