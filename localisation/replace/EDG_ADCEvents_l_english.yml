EDG_ADCEvents.0.desc:0 "During the wars between the Almohad Caliphate and the Marinid Sultanate, the various Taifas of Iberia broke free from Almohad control and declared independence, heralding the Third Taifa Period.\n\nThrough the diligent governance of successive Taifa rulers, Batalyaws has become the most powerful Taifa in southern Iberia and the most promising candidate for reunifying Al-Andalus. Over the preceding centuries, it has repelled countless Christian assaults without losing an inch of territory.\n\nAbdullah assumed rule of the state from his father at the age of 24. While dealing with internal rebellions, worse news was on the horizon. In 1414, a coalition formed by the Kings of Asturias and Portugal officially launched a Crusade against Lisbon. This Crusade was the largest military force assembled since the dawn of the Third Taifa Period, plunging the country into panic. However, under Abdullah's command, the Christian coalition was ambushed and decisively defeated by Muslim forces south of Coimbra, causing the grand Crusade to fizzle out without result. Abdullah earned immense prestige from this victory.\n\nFor the next thirty years, Abdullah continuously fought against the Christians on the front lines, defending the borders. Yet, with advancing age, he found it increasingly difficult to carry on. Domestic problems were no less severe than the distant frontier wars: Abdullah fathered only one son in 1443, but his wife died in childbirth, and the son fell ill. Although the child eventually recovered after treatment, it was bound to have a lasting, detrimental impact on his future. The succession issue was now out in the open, with both domestic and foreign powers eagerly awaiting the death of this elderly Taifa ruler in his sixties to carve up the Taifa state.\n\nThe succession issue was perhaps just one of many troubles; a more severe problem was the domestic religious situation. Although Batalyaws officially adhered to Islam, compared to other Taifas, its Muslim population was very sparse, concentrated mainly in the capital region of Badajoz. The remaining areas practiced a syncretic local religion blending Islamic and Christian doctrines. Due to their overwhelming numbers, successive Taifa rulers had been powerless to address this, making Muslims the minority religious group within the state. For reasons of tax revenue and state stability, the Taifas adopted a policy of non-coercive proselytism, but this only served to postpone the problem. Meanwhile, the religious tolerance policies of past Taifas meant that courtly attitudes towards Christian doctrine were not dismissive as in other Muslim states; instead, it piqued the interest of some courtiers. While superficially all seemed calm, what transpired in private remained unknown... Perhaps due to Batalyaws' ambiguous stance towards Christianity, in 1420, Pope Martin V privately wrote to Abdullah, attempting to persuade him to convert to Christianity. Abdullah sent no reply—neither accepting nor refusing.\n\nIt is foreseeable that after Abdullah's death, the Taifa of Batalyaws will plunge into greater turmoil. Although Abdullah has been renowned as the Guardian of Al-Andalus, he himself cared little for this title. Compared to contributing to the Islamic world, he was more concerned with protecting the state he had governed for over thirty years. Had he been younger, he might have chosen to continue fighting the northern Christians to the end. But now he is old. His past rivals have predeceased him, and their young successors, emulating their predecessors, continue their campaigns, wielding swords and carrying on their slaughter year after year, driven by what they call a righteous cause.\n\nIn recent years, Abdullah has grown increasingly indecisive, constantly pondering how to find a more secure path for his country, by any means necessary—at least, before he draws his last breath, Batalyaws shall not be taken by others."

EDG_ADCEvents.1.name:0 "The Morisco System"
EDG_ADCEvents.1.desc:0 "In the past, religion and culture were almost inextricably linked. The Castilians to the north raised the banner of the Cross, vowing to drive the Moors completely from Iberia. In their view, Moors were synonymous with Muslims, while Moors who converted to Christianity were called Moriscos. Although there seemed to be no grounds for persecution on religious terms, the northern Castilians did not relent. Moriscos remained an extremely discriminated-against group in several northern kingdoms, their status only slightly higher than that of Muslims.\n\nWith Abdullah's baptism in Lisbon and his public declaration of conversion to Christianity, simultaneously proclaiming in the name of Saint James his decision to sever all ties with the past, the situation in Iberia has grown even more uncertain. Converting to Christianity does not mean James (Abdullah) will compromise with the northern Crusaders. He intends to establish a kingdom ruled by Moriscos, to protect those Moors who have embraced Catholicism, shielding the Moriscos from those Crusaders who believe they fight for the Lord but are unaware they have strayed from the path.\n\nDue to James's conversion, the court nobles have shed their disguises, readily accepting the fait accompli, following James into Christianity. Only a handful of nobles attempted to rebel and overthrow James's rule, but they were swiftly eliminated. The flames of war from the north are unlikely to spread to Batalyaws again in the near future, but the Taifas to the east, faced with the blatant apostasy of Abdullah—once hailed as the Sword of Al-Andalus—and such desecration of Islam, will undoubtedly launch a Jihad against Batalyaws.\n\nAfter his conversion to Christianity, James quickly began reorganizing his guard regiments, establishing contacts with northern military orders, streamlining government institutions, and preparing to found a new military order to lead the knightly orders scattered throughout Iberia when the time is ripe.\n\nThe flames of war have not receded, but James no longer seems to fear the future, for he knows there is no turning back. Now he will follow this new path unwaveringly, proving the righteousness of his choice with the remainder of his life."

EDG_ADCEvents.5.desc:0 "Santiago de Compostela is a crucial symbol for Christians in their struggle against Muslims. Its name means 'Saint James of the Field of Stars,' and it is one of the three great pilgrimage sites of Catholicism, believed to be the burial place of James, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus.\n\nAlthough pilgrims continue to visit, past rulers evidently did not hold it in high regard, developing it merely as an ordinary rural town. We must rectify this error. Through a series of planning and construction projects, the royal house intends to build a magnificent church in this city and shift the center of governance to this holy site.\n\nThe progress of construction depends on the funds we allocate. During subsequent reigns, we will have further opportunities to expand the cathedral and develop the city related to the pilgrimage site. In the near future, the Way of Saint James pilgrimage route is destined to flourish."
