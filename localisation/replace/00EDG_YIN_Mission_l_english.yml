EDG_flavorYIN.2.d:0 "The Tang dynasty poet Liu Yuxi once faced the verdant Xisai Mountain and the surging Yangtze River, reciting the timeless masterpiece "Reflections on the Past at Xisai Mountain"—a work that now serves as the perfect footnote for what is about to unfold. Our million-strong army can no longer be stopped; they will end this century of turmoil and reunite the land of Zhonghua.\n\nJinling has witnessed the rise and fall of too many petty southern courts. Whether the thousand-fathom iron chains sunk in the river or the withered well within the Jingyang Palace, all speak of time's relentless passage. The stories of the defeated are destined to fade amidst the misty willows of Taicheng. This city, hailed as "the fair land of Jiangnan, the imperial seat since ancient times," ultimately failed to welcome a ruler capable of unifying the realm. Not even its strategic layout—with a river lying before it and three ridges encircling it—could shield its masters from the conquest of the Heavenly Mandate. We are the ones destined by the final Mandate of Heaven."

EDG_flavorYIN.3.d:0 "Two hundred years ago, the waves of Mount Ya bore witness to the tragic fall of the Song dynasty. Since then, the land of Zhonghua has been tainted with barbarian stench, and its people have suffered cruelty. It was only by the grace of our Great Ancestor, the Sacred Martial Emperor, who could not bear to see the masses plunged into misery, that righteous armies were raised, ultimately annihilating the brutal Yuan.\n\nNow, as the mountains and rivers are on the verge of reunification—from the northern reaches of Youyan to the southern ends of the world, from the western extremes of the Congling Mountains to the eastern bounds of Penglai—all submit to the Han Son of Heaven. With banners spanning ten li and the tiger-guard driving forward unhindered, with three thousand fierce steeds trampling down stubborn foes, the heroic spirits of the late Song—Lu Junshi, Zhang Shijie, and Minister Wen—should they know of this in the netherworld, would surely feel profound consolation.\n\nNow we engrave this stone here, facing the southern horizon forever, to warn all generations: never again seek temporary peace, lest the ancient lands of Ji and Han sink beneath barbarian rule, and the robes and caps of Huaxia be turned to left-lapped collars. May the loyal souls, if aware, find their long-cherished wishes fulfilled. With utmost reverence, we offer this sacrifice."

EDG_flavorYIN.4.d:0 "Since Qin conquered Southern Yue, Han pacified the southwest, and Tang established protectorates, the three commanderies of Jiaozhi, with their unbroken bronze pillars, have long been royal territory. Yet from the Five Dynasties onward, the Central Plains fell into disarray, leaving no time to look south. The Song court, weak and indecisive, accepted mere tributary status, while the Yuan, though formidable, ultimately failed to conquer. Thus, the southern barbarian masses arrogated authority, encroached upon borderlands, and have long gone unpunished. Now we raise armies to chastise and subdue, achieving victory within days. Their chieftains tremble in fear and extend their necks to request audience. With the great army's punitive campaign accomplished, what remains is the matter of governance and pacification."

EDG_flavorYIN.5.d:0 "Since the late Song, the Semu Pu clan led troops against the isolated loyalists of Song, serving the barbarians in defiance of righteousness. As the former Yuan declined, these individuals, nurtured by the Yuan emperors and having enjoyed generations of state favor, not only failed to repay the nation but harbored wolfish ambitions, inciting the Isfahani military revolt that brutalized the people—an act of grave disloyalty. Thus, they faced the great army and ultimately suffered clan extermination. The Yuan lost the world through leniency; now, as state order is restored, a thorough purge must be carried out."
