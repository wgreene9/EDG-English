EDG_BAV_event.1.t: "The Rift"
# EDG_BAV_event.1.d: "On the German lands of the 14th century, the lion of the House of Wittelsbach—Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV, also known as Louis 'the Bavarian'—once reached the peak of his power. This strong-willed monarch not only fiercely contended with the House of Habsburg and the Pope within the Empire but also focused on the family's foundation—Bavaria. Between 1340 and 1349, leveraging his imperial prestige and iron-fisted methods, he temporarily ended the long-standing internal division within the family, reuniting the Duchy of Bavaria, which had been fragmented since 1255, under a single ruler. He set his sights on Munich on the banks of the Isar River, elevating it to the capital of the unified duchy, thereby establishing the city's future lofty status as the heart of Bavaria.\n\nHowever, the unity forged by Louis IV was like a meteor streaking across the night sky—brilliant yet fleeting. In 1347, the emperor died unexpectedly during a hunt, leaving behind a vast empire, a freshly consolidated duchy, and six ambitious sons. The vacuum left by his strongman politics was instantly filled by familial power lust, and the tragedy of fraternal strife quickly unfolded. Unable to agree on the distribution of the inheritance, disputes erupted incessantly. Finally, under pressure from the emperor's successor, Charles IV, the brothers signed the Treaty of Landshut in 1349, tearing Bavaria asunder once more."

EDG_BAV_event.2.t: "Resistance"
# EDG_BAV_event.2.d: "In 1425, Duke John III of Bavaria-Straubing died without leaving a male heir. This fertile land in eastern Bavaria, strategically important, immediately became the coveted target of the other three duchies. All three laid claim to the inheritance, bringing war to the brink. At this critical moment, Sigismund intervened. At the 1429 Imperial Diet of Pressburg, acting as the Empire's supreme arbiter, he issued a final verdict: the Straubing lands were to be divided into three parts and jointly partitioned among the duchies of Munich, Landshut, and Ingolstadt.\n\nSigismund would, as needed, sometimes support Duke Ernest of Munich to counter the ambitious Louis VII 'the Bearded' of Ingolstadt, who was allied with France; at other times, he would reach brief compromises with Louis VII in exchange for money or military aid. In this way, he ensured that no single Bavarian branch could become too powerful, thereby threatening the Empire's balance.\n\nTo raise funds, Sigismund often pledged imperial cities and territories as collateral for loans from the wealthy Bavarian dukes. For instance, he granted mortgages on cities like Nuremberg to Bavarian dukes. This made his relationship with the Bavarian princes not merely one of superior and subordinate, but a complex web of creditor-debtor relations. Every ruling he made in Bavaria likely involved monetary transactions and exchanges of interests behind the scenes.\n\nSigismund utilized the internal strife of the Wittelsbach family to serve his own imperial throne and policies, while simultaneously deepening the complexity of Bavaria's internal conflicts. Now, his life is nearing its end. Perhaps Sigismund's demise will be the perfect opportunity for us to reunify Bavaria."
EDG_BAV_event.2.d: "By the year §Y1444§!, Holy Roman Emperor §YSigismund§! had entered the twilight of his life, yet he clung tenaciously to power. To maintain his lavish court and counter external threats, Sigismund had woven a complex web of debt. He frequently pledged imperial §Ycities§! and §Yterritories§! as collateral to secure loans from wealthy @BAV §YBavarian§! princes. Among these, the jurisdictional rights over the Imperial Free City of §YRegensburg§! had become a focal point of bargaining between the Emperor and Duke §YErnst§! of @UBV §YMunich§!.\n\nThe situation was exceptionally delicate: §YLouis VII§! of @ING §YIngolstadt§!, relying on an alliance with @FRA §YFrance§!, sought to challenge the Emperor's authority; §YErnst§! of @UBV §YMunich§!, leveraging his financial §Yclaims§!, aimed to annex §YRegensburg§! through legal channels before the Emperor's death; while the 'Wise' §YGeorge§! of @LBV §YLandshut§! watched and waited for the chaos that would accompany the imperial succession. §YSigismund§! exploited these intricate conflicts of interest to barely maintain the §YEmpire's§! fragile equilibrium in Bavaria. §OYet, everyone knew that with the Emperor's life counting down, a storm concerning Bavaria's unification and the Empire's fate was imminent.§!"

EDG_BAV_event.3.t: "Undercurrents"
# EDG_BAV_event.3.d: "The Euchites were a sect that emerged around the year 370. They maintained long-term contact with the Bogomils, the Bosnian Church, the Pataria movement, and the Cathars. Due to the spread of the Black Death, the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, and the ensuing great upheaval in the Catholic world, the Euchites, who shared many similarities with the Cathars, rapidly spread throughout the German regions. Many from the lower classes suffering under immense social pressure and the upper classes indulging in hedonism found solace in this sect that advocated for human liberation. Many German lords also believed that tacitly allowing the increase of Euchite followers could repopulate their lands and thus permitted the faith to spread within their domains.\n\nHowever, the doctrines of the Euchites fundamentally conflicted with the orthodox beliefs of the Catholic Church. The Euchites denied the doctrine of Transubstantiation, viewing the Eucharist merely as a symbolic commemorative rite, not the actual transformation into Christ's body and blood. Additionally, the Euchites emphasized a direct relationship between the individual and God, opposing the Church's role as an intermediary, which created a sharp opposition to Catholic doctrine. The Euchites also advocated for simplified rituals and opposed the Church's opulence and authority, views that further angered the Catholic Church.\n\nAs the Euchites spread throughout the German regions, the Catholic Church began to feel threatened. The Church viewed the Euchites as heretics, believing their doctrines undermined the Church's authority and influence. To curb the Euchites' growth, the Catholic Church took a series of measures, including convening church councils, issuing papal bulls, and employing the Inquisition to try and punish Euchite adherents. These measures somewhat contained the spread of the Euchites but also triggered further social turmoil and conflict."
EDG_BAV_event.3.d: "The §YEuchite§! sect originated around §Y370§! AD. Its theological thought shares historical roots with other heterodox movements such as the §YBogomils§!, the §YBosnian Church§!, and the §YCathars§!. Influenced by the social crisis triggered by the §YBlack Death§!, geopolitical shifts following the §YAlbigensian Crusade§!, and the §YGreat Upheaval§! within the Catholic world, the §YEuchites§! experienced a revival and spread in the §YGerman lands§!. Some members of the lower classes burdened by heavy social pressures and some of the upper classes seeking spiritual solace resonated with the sect's tenets, while certain §YGerman§! lords, motivated by utilitarian considerations to expand their territorial populations, adopted a tacitly permissive stance towards the spread of this §Yfaith§!.\n\nHowever, the core doctrines of the §YEuchites§! are fundamentally at §Rodds§! with the orthodox theology of the §YCatholic Church§!. The §YEuchites§! reject the doctrine of 'transubstantiation,' viewing the Eucharist as merely a symbolic ritual rather than the substantial transformation of Christ's body. Furthermore, the sect emphasizes a direct connection between the believer and God, denying the necessity of the Church as an intermediary, which directly contradicts the §YCatholic Church's§! hierarchical structure. Its advocacy for simplified religious rites and opposition to the Church's temporal authority further §Renraged§! the §YCatholic Church§!.\n\nAs the §YEuchites§! infiltrated the §YGerman§! regions, the §YCatholic Church§! perceived them as a grave §Rthreat§! and §Rheresy§!, believing their doctrines aimed to subvert the Church's authority. To curb the sect's spread, the §YCatholic Church§! employed a series of measures including §Yconvening councils§!, §Yissuing papal bulls§!, and operating the §YInquisition§!, imposing severe §Rtrial and punishment§! on §YEuchite§! adherents. Although this high-pressure policy somewhat suppressed the sect's expansion, it also intensified religious and social conflicts, leading to ongoing §Rupheaval and strife§!."

He walked a circle around the assembled travelers, tapping a leather wine skin with his fingers, checking that the oilcloth wrapping the map scrolls was intact. Finally, he approached his eldest son, Alois, and placed a weighty purse of coins into his son's hand, the money emitting a dull clink within. Then, he draped a heavy travel cloak over Alois's shoulders, meticulously fastening the ties with deliberate, unhurried movements.\n\nAlois accepted the purse, securing it to his belt. He checked the position of his sword hilt and adjusted the hat on his head. His posture was erect, his gaze extending past the courtyard walls towards the road leading to Lombardy. Near the great archway leading to the main palace building, a figure briefly appeared in the shadows before retreating, a heavy oak door closing softly behind it.\n\nAlois turned and gave his father a solemn bow.

EDG_BAV_event.5.t: "Bavarian Unification"
EDG_BAV_event.5.d: "Although Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV von Wittelsbach briefly unified the Duchy of Bavaria between 1340 and 1349, establishing Munich as its capital, discord among his six sons after his death led the family's cadet branches to further splinter into Bavaria-Landshut, Bavaria-Straubing, Bavaria-Ingolstadt, Bavaria-Munich, and others. In 1425, with the death of Duke John III, the male line of the Straubing branch died out. In 1429, under the arbitration of Emperor Sigismund, his territories were partitioned among the Dukes of Bavaria-Munich, Bavaria-Landshut, and Bavaria-Ingolstadt. From then on, Bavaria was effectively ruled by three branches of the Wittelsbach family. However, recently, the Duke from Landshut has, by force of arms, gained control over Munich and Ingolstadt, shattering the delicate balance in Bavaria. They have now submitted a declaration for a unified Bavaria to the Emperor, a document which has found its way onto the round table of the Imperial Diet. While their recent aggressive expansion has stirred discontent among a significant portion of the Imperial princes—some dukes fear they might be the next to have their lands seized—many others believe that a unified Wittelsbach family would strengthen the Empire's overall power, enabling it to better resist foreign invasions."

EDG_BAV_event.9.d: "The breeze by the Isar River now caresses a whole and new Bavaria. The wheel of history turns at this moment, as if returning to that brief golden age a century past, but this time, fate has chosen a starkly different course.\n\nOnce, the lion of the House of Wittelsbach, Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV, relying on his unparalleled prestige and iron will, brought the family's territories, fragmented since 1255, together under one hand between 1340 and 1349. He established Munich as the capital of the unified duchy, allowing the city by the Isar River to first glimpse the future glory it would hold as Bavaria's heart. Yet, this unity was like a meteor streaking across the night sky—brilliant but fleeting. In 1347, the emperor's sudden death, like a thunderclap, tore apart this fragile unity. His six sons could not inherit their father's vision and resolve. Fraternal strife and endless disputes culminated in the 1349 Treaty of Landshut, which once again tore Bavaria into fragments. Louis IV's dream thus evaporated into a bubble, leaving behind a century of division and regret for posterity.\n\nNow, the name of [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall be remembered alongside Louis IV, but the achievement of [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall be more enduring and more solid. [Root.Monarch.GetName] not only recreated the emperor's great work but completed the mission he could not finish. [Root.Monarch.GetName] withstood interference and obstruction from Imperial princes, healed generational rifts and suspicions within the family, and reforged the once-independent duchies of Munich, Ingolstadt, and Landshut, along with the city council of Regensburg and the cathedral of Salzburg, into an unbreakable whole.\n\nThe lion of the House of Wittelsbach, after a century's silence, has at last roared once more, shaking all of Germany. Munich is no longer the capital of one of the divided duchies, but the undisputed heart and soul of all Bavaria. From the foothills of the Alps to the Franconian Forest, from the banks of the Danube to the Bohemian frontier, a unified, powerful, and vibrant Bavaria now stands. It is no longer a pawn to be moved on the Imperial chessboard, but a significant player capable of vying with the Habsburgs, the Luxembourgs, and any emerging power. Poets will sing of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s deeds, historians will record [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s accomplishments.

Ever since the glorious legacy of Emperor Louis IV was partitioned among his descendants, the lands of Bavaria have groaned under the shadow of fraternal strife. The Dukes of Munich and Ingolstadt, immersed in the power games of kin fighting kin, long ago cast aside the Wittelsbach family's testament of unification. They slander and weaken each other, driven only by narrow territorial ambitions, bringing shame upon the interests of the entire family.\n\nIn Landshut, the Wittelsbach [Root.Monarch.GetName] has run out of patience. Diplomatic niceties and Imperial arbitration can no longer mend this deep rift; only the flames of war can cleanse away this century of division. Ancient rights of inheritance and greater power have bestowed upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] the duty and authority to end this all.\n\nIn the encampment by the Isar River, horns have sounded. War banners bearing the blue and white lozenges snap in the wind. Soldiers from Upper Bavaria polish their spears, their gazes fixed firmly towards Munich in the south and Ingolstadt in the west. This is no simple family feud; it is a war of unification concerning Bavaria's future. The lion of Wittelsbach will use its claws to tear asunder the shackles of division, allowing the Bavarian eagle to soar once more in the German skies."

EDG_BAV_event.11.d: "The ancient walls of Regensburg have witnessed the iron hooves of Roman legions and listened to the clamor of Imperial Diets. For centuries, this pearl on the Danube has maintained its independence and dignity as a 'Free Imperial City', nestled between the great powers of Germany. The Imperial eagle flag flying on its walls was the symbol of its direct subordination to the Emperor, free from allegiance to any local prince. The citizens took pride in this freedom; the city council guarded this charter, granted since 1245, as a precious treasure.\n\nHowever, history is ultimately written by force. When the Bavarian army stood before its walls, when the war banners of [Root.Monarch.GetName] unfurled across the Danube, this ancient freedom appeared so fragile. The city council sent messengers galloping for aid to the Empire, already largely a phantom, but silence was their only reply. They also tried to muster a militia, to oppose the well-trained, well-equipped Bavarian soldiers with outdated weapons and flesh and blood, but this was akin to a mantis trying to stop a chariot.\n\nWith the moment the battering ram breached the St. Peter's Gate, Regensburg's fate was sealed. The Bavarian banner replaced the Imperial eagle atop the town hall tower. That Imperial privilege, preserved for hundreds of years, now became a scrap of meaningless paper, set ablaze by the new lord. The citizens bowed their heads and surrendered the city keys, their eyes filled with loss and fear, but even more so, with confusion about the future. This once-free city is now just another ordinary town under the rule of the Duke of Bavaria."

They were no longer haughty dukes, but defeated captives. The courtly confrontations of the past have become the imprisonment of the vanquished. Their eyes are a mixture of resentment, anger, and a trace of irrepressible fear. The air carries the scent of gunpowder and dust, mingled with the aura of despair emanating from the defeated.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s gaze looked past them, as if seeing the tragedy of a century ago. Emperor Louis IV's six sons, just like this, tore a unified duchy into fragments amidst greed and suspicion, inviting Imperial interference and plunging the House of Wittelsbach into a century of internal strife.

From the humiliation of Canossa to the Concordat of Worms, this prolonged conflict known as the 'Investiture Controversy' profoundly shaped the German lands and sowed deep wariness of ecclesiastical power in the hearts of Emperors and princes alike.\n\nNow, Bavaria's unification has completely altered the region's power dynamics. The Archbishop of Salzburg, once an independent Imperial prince who sat as an equal with the dukes in the Imperial Diet, finds himself in the heartland of a powerful, centralized state, his independent secular authority hanging by a thread. His fiefs, his armies, his revenues lie before a hungry monarch who has just achieved unification, like a succulent piece of meat.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] engaged in no more futile debate or waited for papal judgment. In the court of [Root.Capital.GetName], the Duke summoned the clergy and nobles of Bavaria and declared in an unmistakable tone: from this day forward, the power to grant the Archbishop of Salzburg his crosier—symbolizing his secular lands, armies, and taxes—belongs to the Duke of Bavaria. This was not a negotiation, but a fait accompli. The Archbishop may still keep his ring, continue to administer the sacraments and consecrations, but his soldiers will swear allegiance to Munich, and his coffers will open to Bavaria's treasurer.

Their bloodlines, estranged by a century of division, are now reconnected under the same blue and white lozenge banner. This is not submission, but a final acknowledgment of the family's shared destiny.\n\nThe councillors of Regensburg also stand among the gathering. They once fought for their city's freedom, but now they see the broad markets and stable future a unified Bavaria can bring. Their commercial acumen and wealth will no longer serve merely to protect an isolated city, but will become the engine of prosperity for the entire duchy.\n\nAnd the Archbishop of Salzburg, having surrendered his secular authority, now recites a blessing for this newly unified duchy in his ornate vestments. The power of the Church has chosen, at this moment, to align with the crown, jointly consolidating the faith and order of this land.

The seat of Duke [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Landshut occupies a prominent place, yet the table before him stands bare, save for the blue and white lozenge banner symbolizing Bavaria, lying there like a silent lake.\n\nAt last, an aged Count from Franconia, having secured the tacit approval of several Archdukes, rises shakily, leaning on his cane. His voice is old yet resonant, stirring echoes in the cavernous hall: 'Most esteemed Electors, Your Highnesses! We gather here today not to squabble over trivial border disputes, but to defend the Empire's peace and its ancient laws! Duke [Root.Monarch.GetName] of the House of Wittelsbach—his armies have marched into Munich's streets, his soldiers occupy the walls of Ingolstadt, he has even stretched his hand towards the privileged Free Cities and Prince-Bishoprics of the Empire!

Some dukes' eyes gleam with schadenfreude, while others betray unease and fear, as if already seeing their own lands devoured by the Bavarian beast.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has remained motionless throughout. He has not even glanced at the impassioned Count. His fingers, clad in black leather gloves, tap a nearly imperceptible, rhythmic beat upon the cold oak armrest of his chair.

He sees the descendants of those families that carved up Louis IV's legacy a century ago; he sees the princes who once argued furiously over scraps of land before Emperor Sigismund. Each of them bears the stain of family feuds or neighborly conquests, yet now they put on the guise of defenders of Imperial peace.\n\nA cold, almost undetectable sneer slowly spreads across [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lips.

I believe this is precisely what I must learn—not only the art of war, but the skill to command hearts and interests.\n\nI hear Wolfgang is growing up. I hope he lives up to your nurturing, and I ask you to guide him well. The northern winds must still be cold; please take good care of your health. Also, please give my regards to... to everyone at court on my behalf.\n\nThis journey is not exile, but tempering. Once I have learned what I need, I will return north. Then, I shall stand before you as a more worthy heir.\n\nThe night is deep, and Milan's lights are also fading. I shall end here.\n\nYour loyal son,\nAlois"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] held the letter close to the candle flame, reading it carefully once more, then slowly folded it and placed it back on the table. He rose and walked to the window, gazing out at the familiar, profound night sky."

EDG_BAV_event.17.d: "Merely months after the last letter, the court of [Root.Capital.GetName] received another missive from Lombardy. This time, the envelope's seal bore not only Alois's mark but also the additional impression of a crest intertwined with a serpent and a lily—the emblem of Milan's Visconti family.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], with a touch of bewilderment, opened the letter. Alois's familiar script leapt from the page, but unlike before, these strokes brimmed with irrepressible excitement and tenderness.\n\n"Father,\n\nPlease forgive my presumptuous words, for I am ruled by an emotion I have never known before. At the court of Milan, I met a lady—Maria Visconti, niece of Duke Filippo. I came here thinking to study war and statecraft, never imagining I would find my destiny here.\n\nHer eyes are as clear as the waters of Lake Como; her wisdom and conversation surpass any book I have read. By the fountain in the garden, we discussed philosophy; amidst the melodies of the ball, we exchanged knowing glances. Father, I am utterly captivated, unable to extricate myself. I have expressed my feelings to her, and fortunately, she holds the same affection for me.\n\nI am deeply aware of the weight this marriage carries—it is not merely the union of two young people, but an alliance between our House and the Visconti. Yet I assure you, this is not a purely political calculation. My love for her is as solid as the Alps. I have already conveyed a formal proposal to the Duke through my entourage. At this moment, I earnestly seek your blessing.\n\nYour son far in the north,\nAlois"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] gently placed the letter on the desk, his fingers unconsciously tapping the tabletop. He walked to the window, staring into the distance. The words from the letter still echoed in his mind, but what he saw was a far grander panorama."

EDG_BAV_event.18.d: "The air in the study seemed to solidify. The fire in the hearth crackled, unable to disperse the chill of this silence. Wolfgang stood before the desk, head bowed, hands clutching tightly at the hem of his tunic, knuckles white with strain. A shallow scratch marked his cheek, and his fine court doublet was slightly disheveled.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat in his throne-like chair, not looking at any document before him. His gaze, sharp as a hawk's, was fixed on his young heir. He remained silent, only tapping a slow, rhythmic beat on the armrest with his fingers. Each tap felt like a heavy blow to Wolfgang's heart.\n\n'Look up.' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s voice was not loud, yet carried undeniable authority.\n\nWolfgang raised his head with difficulty, his eyes a mix of defiance and a barely perceptible fear.\n\n'Tell me,' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tone remained calm, 'why was the son of Count von Regensburg carried from the banquet, while you stand here like a defeated bull? Was it because he mocked you as merely the 'temporary' margravial heir?'\n\n'He... he insulted brother Alois!' Wolfgang blurted out, his voice trembling with emotion. 'He said brother was an exiled coward, that you... you valued a wanderer more! And... and he said brother Alois was in league with those detestable Euchite heretics!'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tapping ceased. He slowly rose and walked to stand before Wolfgang, looking down at him. 'And so your solution was to use your fists? You answered insults against your brother and me with a childish brawl? You gave the whole court a spectacle, shamed an important vassal family—is this how you prove yourself?'\n\nHe reached out, not to comfort, but to grip Wolfgang's shoulder with such force that the youth winced.\n\n'I placed you in this position not for you to wallow in honor and anger! I need an heir who can stabilize the overall situation, not a powder keg that explodes at a touch! Alois is in Italy learning how to maneuver among people, how to achieve goals with words and interests, while you use the most primitive, most foolish method to undermine my efforts!'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] released his grip, stepping back, his eyes filled with disappointment."

To celebrate the autumn harvest and hone knights' skills, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had ordered a grand tourney. Nobles flocked from across the land, displaying their armor and prowess under the sun.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat beneath the canopy of the high platform, his expression as stern as ever. His gaze did not linger on the flashy jousts but turned towards the young knights engaged in swordplay at the field's edge. There, his younger son Wolfgang was sparring with a baron from a neighboring lordship, a man famed for his strength.\n\nNot long ago, this youth had been punished with mucking out stables for his reckless brawl. Now, the impulsiveness and arrogance were gone from Wolfgang's face, replaced by an unprecedented focus. He no longer charged wildly. His footwork was steady, his swordplay disciplined. He was like a sponge, absorbing the force of each of his opponent's fierce assaults, searching for openings in the gaps.\n\nThe baron, failing to break through, grew impatient. A heavy, forceful slash left him exposed. Now! Wolfgang did not choose to retaliate with equal force. Instead, he sidestepped, his practice sword precisely deflecting the baron's wrist, then lightly placed its tip against the baron's throat. The entire sequence was clean and efficient, without a single wasted motion.\n\nSurrounding silence was followed by a burst of enthusiastic applause. The baron paused, then laughed heartily. Sheathing his sword, he clapped Wolfgang on the shoulder, his eyes full of approval.\n\nWolfgang sheathed his sword and bowed, humble and composed. He lifted his head, his gaze traversing the crowd to meet his father's on the high platform."

EDG_BAV_event.20.d: "This letter was heavier than any before. Inside the envelope, besides the letter, were several detailed sketches of architectural domes and anatomical drawings unlike anything [Root.Monarch.GetName] had ever seen. The ink on the paper seemed imbued with a Lombard passion and vitality.\n\n"Father,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.\n\nMaria and I recently accompanied her uncle, the Duke of Milan, on a visit to Florence. I assure you, the light of this city could dim the most brilliant gemstone. Here, people do not speak of war and taxes; they speak of beauty, proportion, and human potential.\n\nI visited the workshop of a craftsman named Leonardo. He is not only a painter but also an engineer and anatomist. He showed me his paintings—they were no longer flat icons; the figures seemed to possess real flesh and soul, the backgrounds vast and deep. He calls it 'perspective'. He also showed me his notes on studying birds' wings, believing that one day man could also fly like a bird. It sounds near-heretical, yet seeing the light in his eyes, I could not refute it.\n\nHere, the nobles no longer take pride solely in lineage and martial exploits; they pride themselves on knowledge and taste. They gather, loudly reciting the original texts of Plato and Cicero, not merely relying on theologians' commentaries. They call it 'Humanism', believing in the value and dignity of man, believing that happiness and glory in this life are equally important.\n\nFather, when I first arrived, I thought these people were hedonistic and weak-willed. But now I understand—I was wrong. This is a new kind of power, a power of ideas. A city-state that can ignite its people's passion with art and knowledge possesses a cohesion and creativity no less formidable than a well-trained army. I even wonder: could the architecture of our [Root.Capital.GetName] be more magnificent, more harmonious? Could our subjects, through education, unleash even greater potential?\n\nMaria often laughs at me, saying I'm like a child who discovered a new world. Perhaps I am, but I feel as if I am standing on the threshold of a new age.\n\nYour son in Lombardy,\nAlois"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] set the letter down and picked up the sketches. He examined the precise depictions of human musculature, then the intricate mechanical designs, his brow furrowed. He understood war, understood money, understood alliances, but... "

EDG_BAV_event.21.t: "Sickbed"
EDG_BAV_event.21.d: "The air in the bedchamber was thick as lead, absorbing all sound, leaving only the occasional crackle from the hearth and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s own labored, difficult breaths. His once hawk-sharp eyes were now clouded. Lying in bed under heavy velvet covers, he still felt a chill seeping from his very marrow.\n\nHis gaze was unfocused, staring vacantly at the ornate canopy above. The family crests embroidered in golden thread seemed blurred and distant in the dim candlelight. He no longer had the strength to review documents; even lifting a hand was a tremendous effort. Power—the thing he had pursued all his life—was now dissipating along with his fading life.\n\nHis thoughts, however, drifted to distant Lombardy.\n\nIt had been nearly half a year with no word from Alois. The last letter, full of enthusiasm for Greek antiquities and Italian painters, had come from Florence. Since then, nothing. Had the letter been lost on the road? Or had he met with some misfortune? The Alpine winter was cruel; bandits and mercenaries were everywhere.\n\nEven more terrifying was a thought he dared not dwell on: Had Alois forgotten this home? Had he become so enthralled by Lombardy's pleasures and novel ideas that he never wished to return? [Root.Monarch.GetName] had sent him away to become a more worthy heir, not a wayward wanderer.\n\nHe regretted. That morning, why had he not spoken more words? Why had he merely silently fastened his son's cloak instead of embracing him? He had given him a purse, given him maps, but forgotten the simplest phrase: 'Take care.'\n\nHis younger son Wolfgang kept vigil by the bedside, his eyes filled with concern. The once-impulsive youth had learned composure and responsibility. But he could not fill the void in his father's heart. In [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s increasingly blurred vision, Wolfgang's face overlapped with Alois's figure, then separated. He wanted to see Alois, to tell him he was proud of him, to tell him he had forgiven everything.\n\nSummoning all his remaining strength, he turned his head slightly. His lips moved, but almost no sound emerged. Consciousness was sinking into darkness, but within that void, a single thought burned on, like an ember unwilling to die."

EDG_BAV_event.22.d: "The sky over [Root.Capital.GetName] was overcast, a fine, cold rain having fallen for three full days. The cathedral bells tolled low and solemn, echoing repeatedly through the city, as if mourning the passing of a sovereign.\n\nInside the church, candlelight flickered but could not dispel the pervasive chill. A heavy oak coffin lay before the altar, draped with the Bavarian eagle's coat of arms. The family banners, dampened by the rain, hung limply. Nobles and subjects clad in black filled the vast space, their suppressed sobs rising and falling in the emptiness.\n\nWolfgang stood before the coffin, dressed in the somber attire of the mourning Margrave. His face was solemn, bearing grief with fortitude, yet his eyes held a resolve beyond his years. He represented the family's present and future, and in this solemn rite, he had to stand tall.\n\nJust as the priest began to recite the final eulogy, a cold gust of wind swept in from the church entrance, extinguishing several candles and causing a collective shudder among the assembled.\n\nThe mourners and nobles, heads bowed, turned almost as one towards the doorway. There stood a travel-worn figure, rainwater dripping from his cloak, pooling into a small puddle on the polished marble floor. He looked utterly exhausted, his face marked by the fatigue of a long journey and an ineffable sorrow, as if he had crossed mountains and rivers only to arrive a step too late.\n\nHe lifted his head, his gaze passing over the crowd to settle precisely on Wolfgang standing at the forefront."

EDG_BAV_event.23.d: "The dirge of the funeral had scarcely faded when the atmosphere within the [Root.Capital.GetName] Cathedral shifted from sorrow to a solemn expectancy. There was no hesitation or dispute, for all knew in their hearts—the throne belonged to one man alone, the eldest son who had finally returned to stand before his father's bier.\n\nAlois stood at the center of the church. He had shed his travel-worn clothes and now wore the formal attire prepared for the heir. His face bore the weariness of long travel and the grief of losing his father, but his back was straight, his gaze calm and resolute, as if prepared to shoulder this sudden, immense weight.\n\nAmong the nobles in the front row stood Wolfgang. Clad similarly in mourning attire, his gaze rested calmly upon his brother.\n\nAt this moment, a senior noble stepped forth from the ranks. Under the gaze of all, he approached Alois and bowed respectfully.\n\n'Alois von Wittelsbach,' his resonant voice echoed through the church, 'in accordance with the will of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the ancient laws of Wittelsbach blood, we, the nobles of Bavaria, hereby acknowledge you as our sole and rightful ruler.'\n\nHaving spoken, he stepped back, signaling to the Archbishop.\n\nThe Archbishop approached Alois, holding the ancient family crown.

He did not discuss taxes or border disputes; instead, he spread a large drawing across the table.\n\nThe drawing depicted not new fortresses or military routes, but the blueprint of an ideal city. Broad plazas replaced narrow alleyways, a grand library and university occupied the city center, and there was even a cathedral with a massive dome in the Florentine style.\n\n"What my father left me is a strong and powerful Margraviate," Alois's voice was steady and forceful, echoing through the council chamber. "But I desire more. I have seen how artists in Florence make a city immortal with color and stone; I have seen how scholars in Milan find the wisdom to govern states in ancient Greek scrolls. This is not extravagance, but a new kind of power."\n\nHe tapped his finger on the university building in the drawing. "Knowledge and creativity are treasures more valuable than iron ore or gold. A well-educated subject becomes a better soldier, a shrewder merchant, and a more loyal official. I wish to start from [Root.Capital.GetName], inviting Italian scholars, architects, and artists to our lands.

EDG_BAV_event.27.d: "The flames of Freising are igniting all of Bavaria.\n\nSince the murder of Archdeacon Albrecht, persecution of the Euchites has spread from Freising to major cities like Munich, Regensburg, and Augsburg. Envoys of the Inquisition, like hounds scenting blood, are fanning the flames of fear and hatred among the populace. In town squares, the stakes burn day and night; from prison dungeons, the screams of the torture chambers rise and fall without cease.\n\nYet, the harsher the oppression, the fiercer the resistance.\n\nLast night, a shocking event occurred in Munich—St. Peter's Church was set ablaze, the roaring flames consuming this two-century-old building. When the fire brigade arrived, they could only retrieve three charred bodies from the ruins, and a piece of tattered cloth nailed to the church doors, bearing words written in blood: 'You kill in God's name; we resist in the name of justice.'\n\nThis was no isolated incident. A tax collector in Regensburg was stoned to death on his way home. An inquisitor in Augsburg found a skinned lamb hanging at his doorstep in the morning, a note reading 'You're next' tied around its neck. Even in Freising, the severe Heinrich von Kramer had a firebomb thrown at him from the crowd during a sermon. It missed, but it underscored the gravity of the situation.\n\nWorse, the violence is no longer confined to Euchite adherents. Many commoners discontent with the Church's methods of persecution, merchants sympathetic to the Euchites' plight, and even some minor nobles are beginning to support the resistance openly or covertly. Urban law and order have deteriorated sharply. Gang fights, arson, and robberies are rampant. Some radical Euchites have even begun organizing armed groups, attacking Church property and personnel in rural areas.\n\nOutside the window, distant shouts and sounds of shattering echo.

EDG_BAV_event.28.d: "A long time has passed since the proclamation of the 'Edict of Grand Pardon'. Initially, no one believed the edict would be truly enacted. Hardliners in the Catholic Church privately mocked it as a 'weak compromise', while radical Euchites suspected it was a 'trap to lure in the enemy'. However, when the first groups of Euchite militia who laid down their arms safely returned home, and when the first tranche of royal funds was actually used to repair destroyed Euchite meeting houses, people began to realize—the King was serious.\n\nSt. Martin's village on the outskirts of Munich was once one of the most fiercely contested areas. Its Catholic church and Euchite meeting house were throwing torches at each other a month ago. Now, they stand side by side, undergoing restoration by royal craftsmen. The village elder, an elderly Catholic, stood alongside the Euchite elder while overseeing the repairs. They did not speak, only silently watched the busy workers, but this silence itself was a form of reconciliation.\n\nIn Regensburg, Johannes, the former Euchite leader of the armed resistance, entered the town hall with twenty-three of his followers. They surrendered their hidden weapons—rusty swords, crude crossbows, even a few firearms captured from church guards. The local magistrate, following the edict's promise, announced their pardon on the spot and issued each a certificate. When Johannes walked out of the town hall, the sunlight was so bright it stung his eyes. He covered his face and wept silently.\n\nMore and more are choosing peace. Merchants have resumed trade, farmers have returned to their fields, and even families once bitterly opposed have begun to attempt reconciliation. In the Augsburg marketplace, a Catholic merchant and a Euchite blacksmith rekindled an old friendship through haggling. They did not speak of faith, only of the weather, the harvest, and news of their children."

EDG_BAV_event.29.t: "Border Incursion!"
EDG_BAV_event.29.d: "An ultimatum from [Emperor.Capital.GetName] arrived on the desk in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] used a silver letter opener to break the seal and unfolded the heavy parchment. Every word on the page seemed dipped in venom, brimming with condescending judgment. In the name of the Holy Roman Emperor, [Emperor.Monarch.GetName], the letter declared that the Duchy of Bavaria had 'repeatedly crossed the boundaries permitted by God and the Empire'. It demanded the immediate cessation of the 'illegal harboring' of the so-called 'Euchite' heretics denounced by the Church and, within seven days, the surrender of all registered heretics and their families to the Imperial Inquisition for 'unified and holy disposition'. At the end, a line of cold threat hissed like a viper: 'Failing this, Bavaria shall face the Empire's unshakable and comprehensive sanctions, until it is utterly erased from the map.'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingertips traced the parchment. His thoughts returned to a decade ago, to the brutal war for Bavarian unification. When his father finally unified Bavaria and returned to Munich with a weary army, what awaited them was not glory, but a siege meticulously orchestrated by Habsburg diplomats at the Imperial Diet. They spread rumors that the House of Wittelsbach intended to establish a 'Southern Kingdom' disobedient to the Emperor, stoking the ancient German princes' fear and hatred towards us, isolating us in the Empire's corner. They built an invisible wall around us with gold and lies.\n\nAs for the 'Euchites'... a cold sneer touched [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lips. These believers were merely craftsmen and peasants seeking solace in the shadow of the Black Death. They were industrious, law-abiding, and brought prosperity to Bavaria's cities. Did the Habsburgs truly care about the salvation of their souls? No. They cared only that these believers' property could be easily confiscated, and their existence could serve as the perfect casus belli. What the Habsburgs desired was never 'purifying the faith'. It was Bavaria's fertile territories, our family's accumulated wealth, and the complete strangulation of any German power that might challenge their hegemony."

The Empire's princes whispered behind their hands, bets placed on the Habsburgs; Venetian merchants had long since closed credit lines with Bavaria; even the Papacy sent envoys, ready to judge this 'rebellious duchy that shelters heretics' after the war. All awaited Bavaria's downfall, the end of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nBut what they awaited was a miracle.\n\nIn the war's early days, Habsburg armies flooded the Bavarian borders. They were numerous, well-equipped, high in morale, as if victory were within easy reach. The decisive battle on the outskirts of Munich became the turning point. Facing numerically superior Imperial forces, the Bavarian army did not retreat. When the charge sounded, not only the regular army, but even Euchite militia who should have been in the rear spontaneously rushed onto the field. A witness later recalled: 'I saw a Euchite blacksmith, wielding a warhammer he had forged himself, charge into enemy ranks, shouting "For our children!" Beside him were a group of similarly ragged craftsmen and peasants. They had no fine armor, no exquisite weapons, but they possessed the most powerful weapon—faith.'\n\nThe bloody melee on the battlefield lasted an entire day. When the sun set, the Imperial lines finally broke.\n\nThe tide of war after that fell like dominoes. One Imperial stronghold after another was captured, one city after another liberated. By the time the Bavarian army reached the gates of [EDG_BAV_event_31_country_target.Capital.GetName], the city's inhabitants had already opened the gates of their own accord. They were weary of Habsburg tyranny, weary of endless war taxes, weary of the Inquisition's terror.\n\n[EDG_BAV_event_31_country_target.Monarch.GetName] received [Root.Monarch.GetName] upon the throne in the imperial palace.

The border defenses crumbled like paper before the Empire's overwhelming numbers. Allies who swore fealty chose silence at the final hour, some even turned their coats. The Bavarian army was at an absolute disadvantage in both numbers and quality. Though the soldiers fought with utmost bravery—some to the last breath, some choosing death over surrender—courage seemed so pale before the cold reality of war.\n\nIn the great hall of the palace, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits silently, listening to the sounds of fighting drawing ever nearer. The ministers have long since fled; only a few of the most loyal guards remain at the doors.\n\nThe doors are battered open. Imperial soldiers pour into the hall.

It states that over the past few weeks, a significant number of Euchite believers have poured into the province from other regions. Among them are refugees who lost their homes in the earlier conflicts, as well as those who, taking advantage of the religious tolerance policy, have actively migrated here seeking better lives. These newcomers have erected crude shanties on the outskirts of towns, established new meeting houses, and even begun publicly preaching their doctrines in the marketplaces.\n\nThe local Catholic residents are uneasy about this. A wealthy merchant wrote in a petition: 'These people not only occupy our land but also openly slander the Virgin Mary and mock our sacraments in public. If Your Majesty continues to indulge them, I fear [EDG_BAV_event_33_province_target.GetName] will become another breeding ground for heresy.' The bishop of the diocese has expressed similar concerns, warning that if left unchecked, the Euchites' influence may surpass that of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, representatives of the Euchites have also submitted their petition. They claim they merely seek a place to live, are willing to abide by the kingdom's laws, and are prepared to pay a reasonable price for residency. A Euchite elder pleaded in a letter: 'Your Majesty's mercy gave us a second life. We do not seek privileges, only a place to dwell. We are willing to prove our loyalty through labor and taxes.'\n\nThe local governor concludes his report: 'The situation is currently manageable, but Your Majesty must make a decision swiftly. Allowing them to stay could increase tax revenue and labor, but may provoke discontent among local Catholics. Expelling them, while appeasing the Catholic Church, would undermine the trust established by the Edict of Grand Pardon and might cause these people to flee to neighboring countries, or even take up arms again.'"

EDG_BAV_event.34.t: "Freising Crisis"
EDG_BAV_event.34.d: "The Euchites were a sect that emerged around the year 370. They maintained long-term contact with the Bogomils, the Bosnian Church, the Pataria movement, and the Cathars. Due to the spread of the Black Death, the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, and the ensuing great upheaval in the Catholic world, the Euchites, who shared many similarities with the Cathars, rapidly spread throughout the German regions. Many from the lower classes suffering under immense social pressure and the upper classes indulging in hedonism found solace in this sect that advocated for human liberation. Many German lords also believed that tacitly allowing the increase of Euchite followers could repopulate their lands and thus permitted the faith to spread within their domains.\n\nHowever, a recent heinous incident in Freising has revealed the crisis brought by the Euchites. The Archdeacon of Freising Cathedral, Albrecht, was found dead in his study. He did not die naturally—a dagger was embedded in his chest, and his face was marked with a crude spiral symbol drawn in blood. This symbol, under the 'interpretation' of Catholic investigators, was quickly identified as an internal Euchite code for marking 'apostates'.\n\nUpon this news, the entire city of Freising ignited. The official in charge is an envoy dispatched by the Archbishop of Mainz: the Inquisitor Heinrich von Kramer, notorious for his brutal methods and utter ruthlessness towards heretics. On the day he arrived in Freising, he delivered a highly inflammatory sermon in the town square. The populace's grief and fear, under Heinrich's incitement, rapidly transformed into a raging fire of hatred directed at the Euchites. The Catholic forces, long uneasy about the growing influence of the Euchites, finally had the perfect pretext.\n\nThus, an organized persecution began. Under the Inquisition's directive, city guards and incited mobs began assaulting Euchite homes and meeting places. Anyone whose house was found to contain Euchite literature (even if just a few copied verses) or who was accused of attending Euchite gatherings was immediately arrested.\n\nBut this was only the beginning. In the following weeks, Freising became a living hell. Over a hundred Euchite believers were thrown into prison. Under torture, various preposterous 'evidence' of crimes was fabricated: some said the Euchites held black masses at night, coupling with demons; others claimed they consumed the flesh and blood of infants to seek immortality; still others said the spiral symbol was a curse to summon plague—the resurgence of the Black Death was also blamed on them.\n\nMore terrifyingly, the repercussions of the Freising incident are spreading throughout Bavaria. Catholic churches across the land are emulating Freising's methods, launching large-scale hunts and trials against Euchite believers. Many innocent people are accused of being Euchite members; even those merely suspected of having ties to the Euchites cannot escape."

EDG_BAV_event.40.t: "Golden Age"
EDG_BAV_event.40.d: "On Munich's Marienplatz, sunlight bathes the freshly restored walls of the town hall, flocks of pigeons strut across cleanly paved cobblestones. The air is fragrant with the scent of fresh bread, mingled with spices from the distant market. There are no patrols of soldiers, no stakes for heretical burnings, no refugees displaced by war. Only the enthusiastic calls of vendors, the laughter of children at play, and after the church bells, the calm and measured steps of citizens.\n\nThe scars of war have been quietly smoothed over by time. Villages once burned by warfare now boast sturdier, more spacious houses; barren fields are again covered with golden waves of wheat. On the Danube, merchant vessels come and go, laden with Bavarian beer, Bohemian glass, and Italian silks, their masts like forests, sails like clouds. In Regensburg, a new university has been completed. Scholars from across Germany debate here the mysteries of theology, law, and nature—among them, Euchite scholars are present. Their faith is now recognized as part of the 'Bavarian Church', coexisting with Catholic cathedrals under tolerant edicts.\n\nIn the court, the content of reports has also changed. The Treasurer joyfully reports annual treasury revenues have grown for consecutive years, far exceeding pre-war levels; diplomatic envoys bring requests for friendly trade treaties from neighboring states; even the most cautious military advisors now suggest appropriately reducing the standing army to save expenses for construction. Former enemies that once encircled the kingdom have either vanished or become friendly neighbors. The authority of the House of Wittelsbach has never been more secure.\n\nThis is an era where one can almost forget the hardships of the past. Elders in taverns tell young listeners tales of bygone wars and turmoil, stories that sound to the youth like myths from distant legends. Peace and prosperity have become the taken-for-granted backdrop of this land.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] strolls through the palace gardens, the murmuring of fountains and the song of nightingales in his ears. He recalls the long and perilous path from unrest, persecution, war to the brink of collapse, and the step-by-step struggle back. All the effort, sacrifice, and choices have ultimately brought about this scene before him. There is no wild elation, only a deep, hard-won tranquility."

EDG_BAV_event.41.d: "When the army of [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrived, this small town was already a scene of ruins.\n\nThe air carried a complex, nauseatingly sweet and metallic stench—a mixture of charred wood, fresh blood, and damp earth. The streets were strewn with rubble; once neatly cobbled paths were now covered with broken beams, shattered pottery, and torn sectarian banners. A stone statue of the Virgin Mary lay in the middle of the road, her face bludgeoned into obscurity, half her body buried in the mire. On the wall of a nearby burned-out house, the Euchite 'flame' symbol was crudely scrawled in white lime, its edges smeared with a dark reddish stain. The town fountain no longer flowed; its basin was filled with ash and debris. A lone wooden toy horse lay overturned by the poolside, as if abandoned in haste by its owner. The bakery oven was stone cold; its door had been ripped off and used as a barricade, still impaled by a broken spear. A few crows perched on the church bell tower, where the cross had once stood, now replaced by a tattered Euchite banner torn in two, flapping feebly in the morning breeze.\n\nThe conflict here had lasted for weeks—escalating from initial arguments and disputes, to later street brawls, and finally erupting into a full-scale clash last night. No one knows who struck first. Catholics accuse the Euchites of desecrating holy objects, while the Euchites claim Catholic repression forced them to defend themselves.\n\nAmong the ruins, occasional survivors peer out. Their eyes are hollow, filled with fear and numbness. Neither pious devotion to God nor fervent zeal for revelation remains—only the instinct to survive."

EDG_BAV_event.42.d: "In the study of Munich's royal palace, candlelight burned through the night. On the massive oak desk, a mountain of documents teetered like a precarious hill, each representing a bleeding wound somewhere in the kingdom.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat behind the desk, not reviewing them, merely watching. To his left was a scroll from the Catholic Bishops' Synod, its parchment inscribed with impassioned Latin condemning the Euchites as 'wolves in sheep's clothing', demanding the King 'in the name of the Wittelsbach family's honor' to wield royal authority and uproot this 'heretical doctrine'. At the end, the wax seals of over a dozen bishops were arrayed like military phalanxes, heavy and oppressive. To his right lay a petition from a secret Euchite gathering, on rough paper, its handwriting hasty yet carrying an undeniable resolve. They argued their doctrine was the purest interpretation of Scripture, accused the old Church of corruption and decay, sought not the King's endorsement but only a 'fair chance for dialogue', and implored the King to halt the 'unprovoked persecution' by Catholic nobles.\n\nBetween these two diametrically opposed documents lay a report from a Bavarian central administrator, written in a chillingly dispassionate tone detailing last month's death toll, property damage, and refugee numbers caused by religious conflict. Behind the cold figures were shattered families and torn communities. The report's final page included a crude map marked with red ink highlighting the areas of most intense conflict—these red dots, like a deadly plague, were spreading from the kingdom's periphery towards its heart.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] picked up the bishops' letter, then set it down. He took up the Euchites' petition, his gaze lingering for a moment. He felt like a shield, a shield pierced simultaneously by countless sharp spears from all directions—from the Papacy in Rome, his Habsburg relatives in [Emperor.Capital.GetName], zealous Catholics within his own family, and the kingdom's growing number of Euchite adherents... Each exerted immense pressure upon him, demanding a choice. Yet any tilt could shatter this shield completely, dragging both him and the kingdom he sought to protect into the abyss.\n\nHe slowly rose and walked to the window, pushing open the heavy casement. The deepest darkness before dawn enveloped all of Munich; the distant horizon held only the faintest, barely perceptible glimmer of light."

Only a simple reception room with whitewashed walls, a long oak table, a few hard wooden chairs, and a window overlooking the monastery's vegetable garden.\n\nAt either end of the table sit two very different men. On one side is Johannes von Stapitz, a revered Catholic theologian. On the other is a Euchite commoner named Jakob Fuhrer. Between them sits an elderly Franciscan friar, acting as an intermediary. The initial atmosphere was thick enough to drip; Father Stapitz recited a passage from the Bible, and Jakob immediately countered with another, launching into a fierce yet restrained debate over core issues like 'icon veneration', 'purgatory', and 'papal authority'. Their voices were not loud, yet filled with uncompromising conviction.\n\nTime passed minute by minute. The debate gradually shifted from doctrine to reality. Jakob described how believers were punished by lords for refusing to buy indulgences. Stapitz acknowledged that corruption within the Church had indeed disillusioned many devout followers.\n\nJust as the dialogue seemed about to deadlock again, the elderly Franciscan friar spoke in a hoarse voice. He didn't discuss theology. He simply said, 'Winter came early this year. Many refugees in Upper Swabia, regardless of their sect, do not have enough grain for the winter.'\n\nThis statement struck the deadlock like a wedge. Jakob fell silent. Stapitz lowered his head.\n\nAfter a long pause, Stapitz spoke slowly: 'The Church can open part of its granaries, but the distribution process must be just.' Jakob looked up, fixing his gaze on him: 'How can that be ensured? Our believers dare not set foot on Church lands.' 'Then,' Stapitz took a deep breath, 'let royal officials supervise, with representatives from both sides participating. This is not a compromise of faith, but mercy based on common humanity.'\n\nJakob's eyes moved between Stapitz and the Franciscan friar. Finally, he gave a nearly imperceptible nod."

EDG_BAV_event.44.d: "The messenger's arrival brought no forewarning. He claimed to be from Rome and demanded an audience with the King. When [Root.Monarch.GetName] met him in the study, the man produced a wooden box wrapped in fine velvet from his robe, the box bearing the papal seal—two crossed keys and a tiara. The messenger's demeanor was elegant yet haughty. He opened the box and presented a letter sealed with wax with both hands. The envelope was of expensive linen paper, the King's titles inscribed upon it in golden ink.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] took the letter. The messenger gave a slight bow and said in fluent German: 'His Holiness extends his most cordial greetings and hopes Your Majesty's wisdom can lead the straying lambs back to the flock.' His words were polite, yet his eyes held a scrutinizing, superior air. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened the envelope. Inside was a lengthy letter written in impeccable Church Latin.\n\nThe letter began with the Pope expressing 'profound concern' over the 'unfortunate discord' within Bavaria and praising the 'traditional loyalty of the House of Wittelsbach to the Roman See'.\n\nYet the tone shifted sharply. The Pope explicitly stated that the Euchites were 'indisputable heretics', their doctrines 'defiling the holy faith', a threat to all Christendom. The letter sternly criticized King [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s 'policy of tolerance', calling it 'dangerous appeasement' and a 'betrayal of duty', implying such weakness was akin to 'allowing vipers to nest in one's own garden'.\n\nThe letter's conclusion offered no practical help—no mediators, no funds for reconciliation. Instead, it delivered a clear threat: if the King could not 'restore the purity of faith in the realm with firm measures' within a stipulated time, the Papacy would be compelled to take 'necessary actions'. These included, but were not limited to: placing the King under excommunication, establishing an Inquisition in Bavaria, or even uniting neighboring Catholic monarchs for an 'armed crusade' against Bavaria.\n\nKing [Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly placed the letter back on the desk. The air in the study seemed to instantly solidify. He looked out the window. Bavaria's sky was overcast, mirroring the pressure emanating from Rome in the letter. Clearly, this was no letter of concern, but an ultimatum."

EDG_BAV_event.45.d: "Since Regensburg lost its status as a 'Free City', its former town hall has never been so crowded. This ancient Gothic building has witnessed countless Imperial Diets, but the tension it harbored this time was unprecedented.\n\nRepresentatives from all regions of Bavaria, along with the realm's most powerful nobles and senior clergy, were all present. The hall was invisibly divided into three areas. On the left was the traditional Catholic noble faction led by Duke Albrecht of Bavaria-Munich and the Archbishop of Salzburg, dressed in finery, solemn expressions like judges preparing to try heretics. On the right, although formal Euchite representatives were few, the corners and rear of the hall were filled with their sympathizers—plainly dressed, their gazes full of wariness and expectation, forming a silent yet potent undercurrent. In the middle sat officials and moderate nobles loyal to King [Root.Monarch.GetName], their faces anxious, feeling as if seated on pins and needles.\n\nKing [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked alone onto the dais. He wore no crown today, only a dark blue velvet robe. He surveyed the assembly; the hall instantly fell silent, not even a cough was heard.\n\n'Fellow Bavarians, subjects of the House of Wittelsbach,' the King's voice was calm and clear, carried by the hall's acoustics to every ear, 'the land beneath our feet flows with the same blood, shares the same ancestors. Yet now, because of differing interpretations of faith, we take up arms against each other, brothers slaying brothers.' He paused, his gaze sweeping over representatives who had lost families in the conflict. 'This is not God's will; it is our pride and folly.'\n\nThen he presented his proposal: 'Here, in the name of the King of Bavaria, I declare a grand pardon. From this moment, all crimes arising from religious conflict shall be pardoned, provided those involved swear to lay down their arms.'\n\nAs his final words fell, the hall was first gripped by a deathly silence, then erupted into a buzz of discussion. Among the Catholic nobles, Duke Albrecht's face flushed crimson. He rose abruptly, about to refute, but was stopped by a calm glance from the King. On the other side, some Euchite believers wore expressions of disbelief, tears glimmering in their eyes."

EDG_BAV_event.46.d: "The bells of Munich's Marienplatz rang out at noon—not for the ordinary hour, but as a signal summoning the city's populace. People streamed in from every quarter, with varied emotions, converging beneath the town hall balcony.\n\nOn the balcony, the figure of King [Root.Monarch.GetName] appeared. He wore no purple cloak symbolizing power, bore no scepter of authority. He stood alone in a simple black robe, seeming somewhat solitary.\n\nBelow, the crowd was clearly divided. Closest to the balcony were the King's guard and citizen representatives, maintaining order with tense expressions. Behind them were pious Catholic citizens, holding rosaries, murmuring prayers, full of doubts about the King's actions. At the far end of the square gathered many in ragged clothing—Euchite believers, or innocent civilians caught in the war's crossfire, their faces a mixture of hope and unease.\n\nAn official scribe in court attire stepped onto the balcony. He unfurled a long scroll of parchment and began reading in a loud, clear voice: 'By the grace of God, [Root.Monarch.GetName], King of Bavaria, to all my loyal subjects...' The edict's contents spread word by word across the square. It declared that from this day forth, all armed conflict, property seizure, and violent injury within the realm arising from religious differences would be pardoned, provided participants swore before local magistrates to lay down their arms within one month. It promised protection of personal safety and lawful property for believers of all sects. Any lynching or persecution in the name of religion would be deemed a direct challenge to royal authority. Finally, the King announced that part of the royal treasury would be allocated to repair homes and churches destroyed in the conflict, regardless of which sect they belonged to.\n\nAs the scribe finished the last word, the square fell into a long, suffocating silence. Then, the crowd erupted in starkly different reactions. Families who had suffered from the war began to cheer; some fell to their knees, weeping with emotion. From the Catholic believers came boos and curses; an old priest screamed 'Heretics!' in agitation before being restrained by those nearby.\n\nKing [Root.Monarch.GetName] watched all this silently from the balcony, his face expressionless. He slowly bowed his head, clasped his hands before his chest, and murmured in a voice only he could hear:"

We demand that you immediately revoke this so-called 'Edict of Grand Pardon', declare the Euchites illegal heretics, and grant me full authority to purge these vipers lurking in the kingdom's shadows!'\n\nSeveral Catholic officers behind him stepped forward in unison, hands on their sword hilts. Wolfgang's voice grew even more strident: 'They desecrate holy icons, distort Scripture! Every instance of your so-called 'tolerance' towards them is a betrayal of our faith! You are the sovereign of Wittelsbach; your duty is to defend the purity of faith!'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] listened quietly, fingers unconsciously tapping the armrest of the throne, his gaze fixed upon his brother's face, flushed with agitation."

The seal on the envelope, which should have belonged to the city magistrate, had been roughly torn, leaving only a broken wax remnant.\n\nThe letter's contents were brief and chilling: the Royal Academy's theology professor, Friar Augustin—a scholar who had publicly written in support of the King's religious tolerance policy—had vanished the previous night. According to neighbors' testimonies, in the dead of night, at least a dozen heavy cavalry had blockaded the entire street. They bore no family heraldry, their only identifier a crudely painted white flame symbol on their shields—the secret mark of the most radical knights under Wolfgang's command. At the end, the city magistrate added in a trembling hand: 'They broke down the door, took no valuables, only the friar himself.'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly set the letter down, his gaze lingering on the description of the 'flame'. The room was quiet, save for the crackling of wood in the hearth. The King's fingers rested on the smooth desktop for a long while. Finally, he raised his head, his gaze passing over the flickering candle flames to look out the window towards the direction of Wolfgang's residence. It lay shrouded in darkness, utterly silent."

The edges of the paper were slightly curled from hasty delivery, carrying the scent of horse and leather.\n\nThe contents were more specific than ever before: Duke Wolfgang had not merely been holding simple meetings recently, but had been secretly convening multiple times in a disused granary within the Archbishopric of Salzburg with several of that Archbishop's most radical Augustinian friars. An informant recorded a snippet of conversation overheard by chance, in which Wolfgang's voice was clearly discernible: 'The swords are ready, awaiting only God's signal.'\n\nWorse, the report included a small lead coin as evidence. This crude coin was not official royal currency; it bore a simple flame symbol. Allegedly, this currency was being circulated privately among Wolfgang's core guard, replacing the pay issued by the King. Finally, the report named his most trusted standard-bearer, Hans von Rosenheim, who had scraped the Wittelsbach lozenge from his armor and replaced it with this flame brand.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingers brushed over the cold lead coin, then picked up the report, his gaze lingering on 'God's signal' and Hans's name for a long time. He sat in silence for a while, the only sound in the room the faint crackle of the candle flame. Finally, he rose, walked to the fireplace, and threw the entire report and the lead coin into the flames. Orange-red fire instantly consumed the paper; the lead coin gave a soft thud against the hearth floor before being buried in hot ashes.

EDG_BAV_event.50.d: "A few days later, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] reviewed a trade agreement from Augsburg, the chamberlain entered silently and presented a scroll of parchment. This was not an urgent dispatch, but an official transcript of an event from Munich's town hall, bearing the city's wax seal, recording a major incident.\n\nThe transcript described in a dispassionate tone: yesterday morning, the Archbishop of Salzburg addressed thousands of gathered citizens in the square before the Cathedral of Our Lady. Holding aloft a black and red war banner, he publicly proclaimed Duke Wolfgang von Wittelsbach as the 'Defender of the Faith'.\n\nAn attachment to the transcript contained a detailed statement from a witness guard: Duke Wolfgang knelt on one knee before the Archbishop and kissed the edge of the banner. Then, he received a ceremonial longsword symbolizing judicial authority from the Archbishop and raised it towards the crowd. The crowd erupted in sustained shouts, crying out 'Sword of God!' and Wolfgang's name.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] finished reading the entire transcript, then laid it flat on the table. He showed no anger, no sigh, only looked quietly out the window. The council chamber was quiet, save for the distant noise of the city, reminding him this was all real. Only after a long while did he bring his gaze back, as if speaking to himself, or perhaps posing a question to the absent one:"

EDG_BAV_event.51.d: "In the council hall of Munich's palace, the air was heavy as if solidified. Flames in the hearth danced silently, illuminating the pale, tense faces of every noble. All attempts at peace had failed; all patience was exhausted. The final ultimatum had sunk without a trace, met not with repentance but with a 'Declaration of Cleansing Faith' signed by the Archbishop of Salzburg.\n\nThe proclamation denounced [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a 'betrayer of the faith', a 'hypocrite who sides with heretics'. They declared that to 'purify Bavaria's sins', the House of Wittelsbach must be led by 'truly pious warriors'—clearly, Wolfgang was their chosen one.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly placed the proclamation on the table. Wolfgang's signature on the parchment, the familiar handwriting, now resembled a vicious serpent, deeply piercing his eyes. Everything he had tried to maintain—family unity, the realm's stability, religious tolerance—was torn to shreds on this paper.\n\nIn the hall, the nobles held their breath, not daring to make a sound. They watched their King, his clenched fist, his transformation from initial shock and heartache into a bone-chilling coldness.\n\nAfter a long silence, [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised his head. His voice was not loud, yet it pierced the suffocating quiet:"

EDG_BAV_event.52.d: "The smell of gunpowder and blood mingled in the cold morning air, lingering. On the plains outside Munich, corpses lay everywhere; broken pikes and shattered shields littered the ground, silently recounting last night's carnage. The Wittelsbach lion banner fluttered hopelessly from the ruined battlements, yet the land beneath was soaked with its own people's blood.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat on his horse, his armor stained with mud and dried blood. He surveyed the scene, feeling no joy of victory, only a profound exhaustion. This war had no winner.\n\nA group of soldiers escorted a figure forward. It was Wolfgang. His helmet was long gone, his golden hair matted against his blood-and-sweat-streaked forehead. His splendid armor had been stripped, leaving only a torn linen undergarment. The once-haughty face now held only pallor and confusion. His hands were roughly bound behind his back with rope; with each step, the shackles at his feet emitted a heavy, humiliating clank.\n\nA battle-hardened old general approached [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s horse and knelt on one knee, his voice loud and cold: 'Your Majesty, the rebel main force has been annihilated. Duke Wolfgang has been captured. For the realm's stability, to warn all who harbor treasonous thoughts, the rebellion's leader must face execution. His followers must also be purged, to root out future trouble!'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s gaze shifted from his brother, sweeping over the rows of bound prisoners, over the wounded soldiers wailing amidst the ruins, finally settling on the high-flying Wittelsbach banner. He took a deep breath, his voice not loud yet clearly carrying across the deathly quiet battlefield:"

EDG_BAV_event.53.t: "Suspense"
EDG_BAV_event.53.d: "In the council hall, the dust of war had yet to settle. The fine carpets still bore muddy footprints; several noble banners damaged in the fighting were carelessly rolled up against the walls, silently recounting the recent internal strife. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat upon the throne, looking down upon the nobles gathered in hushed silence, their faces a mix of weariness and wariness.\n\nThe newly appointed Archbishop of Salzburg, clad in somber black robes, was the first to break the silence. He stepped forward, his voice cold and sharp: 'Your Majesty, Duke Wolfgang's rebellion has shaken the realm's foundations—an unforgivable crime of treason. Both God's law and Imperial decree point to the same end: the traitor must be purged. Only thus can your mercy be shown not as weakness, and your sovereignty proven unchallengeable.'\n\nA white-haired, battle-hardened general then stepped forth. Dark, dried blood still crusted the crevices of his armor—undoubtedly belonging to Wittelsbach soldiers. He gave no bow, speaking in a hoarse voice as if just returned from the field: 'Your Majesty, the Archbishop speaks truly. Wolfgang still holds sway among the troops. As long as he draws breath, he is a poisoned seed buried in the kingdom's heart. Those with ill intent will always rally behind his banner. For Bavaria's long-term peace and stability, we must root it out entirely. My sword is ready to carry out this difficult sentence for you.'\n\nA low murmur of agreement rippled through the hall like ominous thunder.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingers tightened unconsciously on the throne's armrest, knuckles whitening slightly. His gaze swept across the assembly, finally settling on a set of antlers mounted on the wall to one side. That was the stag Wolfgang had hunted alone as a youth, his first proof of valor. Now, the shadow of those antlers fell upon the Wittelsbach lozenges at the King's feet.\n\nNow, the entire hall's focus converged upon the throne; the air seemed to solidify."

EDG_BAV_event.54.d: "Late at night, the air was thick with the smells of damp mold, metallic rust, and the rot of settled despair. The heavy chains on the cell door clanked open, disrupting the grim equilibrium. A figure entered. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was dressed in rich yet simple black robes of state, the lion emblem embroidered in gold thread faintly visible in the dim torchlight.\n\n'Your Majesty graces this place with his presence,' Wolfgang rasped, his voice full of mockery, 'to admire my wretchedness, or to announce my execution?'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] walked to the cell bars, his gaze calmly resting upon his brother. 'I only wish to know why.'\n\n'Why?' Wolfgang laughed as if hearing the greatest joke. He struggled to his feet, dragging the heavy shackles to the bars, gripping the cold iron tightly, almost bending it. 'You ask me why? Look at what you have done! You fraternize with those blasphemous Euchite heretics, you trade our Wittelsbach honor for worthless peace! You are the one who betrayed our father and our faith!'\n\nHis voice grew louder, ending in almost a roar: 'I led knights charging on the eastern front to defend our holy faith, not so you could return and break bread with them! I swore to purify this land with the sword, and you want to sheathe it, letting the heretics' poisonous weeds run wild! You think your tolerance is mercy? No, it is cowardice!'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] listened quietly, showing no anger, only a profound sorrow. After a long pause, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took something from his robe and passed it through the bars. It was a small, somewhat worn wooden carving of an eagle.\n\n'Remember? We made this together as children. You said the Wittelsbach eagle's gaze should always be fixed upon the enemy.' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s voice softened. 'But you, Wolfgang, pointed your sword at your own people. That is not honor; it is madness.'\n\nWolfgang looked at the carving, unable to tear his eyes away."

EDG_BAV_event.55.d: "When the guards brought Wolfgang here, he was already dressed in clean, simple clothes, but the gauntness on his face and the fear in his eyes could not be concealed. 'Brother,' Wolfgang's voice trembled slightly, uncertain how to address the man before him—both kin and sovereign.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly turned around. He gestured to a chair by the fireplace. 'Sit, Wolfgang. Let us talk.'\n\nWolfgang obeyed, sitting stiffly, his body taut as a drawn bow.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] poured him a glass of Italian wine, the amber liquid swirling in the crystal goblet. 'During my studies in Pavia, my teacher told me that what matters most in a good painting is not brilliant color or precise lines, but 'Chiaroscuro'. Where the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest. He said this gives things soul.'\n\nHe paused, his gaze resting on Wolfgang. 'The Wittelsbach coat of arms is blue and white lozenges, simple and clear, like sword and shield. Yet I became fascinated by those complex plays of light and shadow in Lombardy. Perhaps from that time on, it was destined that one of us brothers would stand in the light, the other in the shadows.'\n\nWolfgang gripped his goblet tightly, head bowed, his voice hoarse: 'I... I don't know what you mean. I only know I lost.'\n\n'You lost not because your armies lacked valor, nor because my strategies were superior.' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s voice was calm yet firm. 'You lost to your own shadow. You always felt I stood in the sunlight, blocking you. Yet you never considered that I stand there to shield the entire kingdom from storms coming from further afar.'\n\nHe walked to the oil painting of the Milanese church, gently touching its frame. 'You thought I spent my days admiring these useless things, didn't you? I studied the Florentine banking system to make our trade routes more secure. I learned Milanese fortifications to strengthen our citadels. I debated theology with papal legates to secure more support for us within the Empire. Wolfgang, governing a nation is like creating a great painting. It requires patience, foresight, and understanding of how to use shadows to highlight the light.'\n\nHe paused, his gaze settling on Wolfgang once more."

I thought you could see my martial achievements.'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes instantly sharpened like ice. 'I saw them, Wolfgang. I saw villages burned by those 'achievements', women and children displaced by those 'achievements', believers kneeling before churches praying for peace, crushed by your 'achievements'. Is this the glorious record you are so proud of?'\n\n'They are heretics!' Wolfgang looked up sharply, unextinguished zeal in his eyes. 'They pray with blasphemous words! Purifying this land is God's will!'\n\n'God's will?' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s voice was not loud, yet carried immense weight. 'In Florence, I saw devout Dominican friars and wealthy bankers praying to God in the same church. In Venice, I saw Orthodox and Catholics living side by side in the marketplace, prospering together. Their ways of faith differ, yet all yearn for a good life. Wolfgang, tell me, is God's will that His children slaughter each other? Or that we learn to find a way to coexist despite our differences?'\n\nHe walked to the oil painting of the Milanese church, gently touching its frame. 'I love art because it teaches me tolerance. Beauty has a thousand forms; so does truth. Yet you, and those bishops who incited you, try to define all of Bavaria with a single, exclusive, bloody 'truth'. This is not piety; it is arrogance.'\n\nWolfgang's lips trembled, wanting to refute, yet finding his brother's words like a net, trapping all his convictions.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] turned, his gaze piercing like fire, striking the deepest corner of his brother's heart. 'Those bishops told you that if you helped me 'correct the deviation', they would support you for the throne, didn't they? They told you my tolerance was weakness, my peace betrayal, that only you were God's chosen, truly strong ruler.'"

'The civil war is over, but beyond our borders, countless people still wait to see us fail.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned, his gaze falling upon his brother. 'I need a sword, one that will make them think twice before crossing our boundaries. And the kingdom's finest sword is currently lying in my dungeon, or... sitting here, awaiting my death sentence.'\n\nWolfgang finally raised his head. His lips moved, but no sound came out.\n\n'You gambled with Wittelsbach blood for an empty promise.' [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tone held no emotion, as if reading a battle report. 'Now, I give you a chance to atone for your sins through action.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] gave him little time to think, issuing a direct command. 'Go to Ingolstadt. The armies there need reorganization; the border defenses need strengthening.' This was not a request, nor a discussion, but an incontrovertible royal order.\n\nWolfgang remained silent for a long time, so long the air in the room seemed to solidify. His eyes were filled with turmoil—shame, resentment, and a trace of irrepressible confusion. He was not ready to be a hero, not even ready for forgiveness. Finally, he slowly stood up. He did not bow, did not pledge an oath. He only asked in a near-hoarse voice, as if forced from his throat: 'My sword... is it still there?'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked at him, a flicker of something undetectable in his eyes. He did not answer, only gestured slightly towards the guard at the door. Understanding, the guard soon brought forth a longsword wrapped in oilcloth and placed it on the table before Wolfgang.\n\nWithout another word, Wolfgang sheathed the sword, turned, and walked towards the door with heavy steps.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] watched him leave until his figure disappeared into the shadows beyond the doorway."

I saw the Euchite militia—those craftsmen and peasants—attacking the enemy archer positions from the flanks with the pitchforks and machetes they brought. They had no armor; they fell like wheat when they charged in...'\n\nThis victory was no accident. Intelligence indicated the Habsburg advance plan had been overconfident; they underestimated Bavaria's terrain and the difficulties of winter marches. Supply lines were overextended, soldiers exhausted, while Bavarian partisans constantly harassed their logistics trains. People in occupied areas did not yield either; they passed intelligence with silent glances, delaying the invaders' progress in every way.\n\n[Emperor.Monarch.GetName] in the palace at [Emperor.Capital.GetName] must be raging over the battle reports.

This stone fortress, a key border stronghold long managed by the Habsburgs, was once hailed as the 'Northern Iron Gate of [Emperor.Capital.GetName]'. When Bavaria's blue and white banner finally flew from its ruined battlements, the symbolic impact far exceeded its strategic value.\n\nThe capture of Braunau was brutal. The defenders' tenacity exceeded all expectations. Bavarian sappers digging tunnels beneath the walls suffered heavy casualties; siege towers burned like moving pyres under attacks with Greek fire. When the walls were breached, Bavarian soldiers entering the city faced defenders fighting house by house and desperate citizens.\n\nYet the real shock came after the breach. In underground storerooms, soldiers found mountains of supplies—enough grain to sustain the garrison for a year, brand new matchlock muskets, and large quantities of gold coins stamped with the Imperial double-headed eagle. More disturbingly, letters seized from the commander's residence revealed the Habsburgs had long planned a full-scale invasion of Bavaria from this location come spring. The initiative in the war had quietly shifted amidst smoke and blood.\n\nAs news spread, Imperial princes began reassessing the conflict. Some Electors previously ambivalent sent secret envoys to Munich; Swiss cantons that had been watching from the sidelines cautiously began offering 'certain conveniences'. The wind was changing.\n\nIn [Emperor.Capital.GetName], panic was spreading. The road to Braunau was now a corridor for Bavarian advance. The Danube, the Empire's lifeline, lay exposed to enemy forces. [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] convened an emergency council overnight; the arguments reportedly echoed throughout the Hofburg. Should troops be diverted for a counterattack, or should defenses be consolidated to hold core territories? Either choice meant the myth of Habsburg invincibility was shattered."

Abandoning defenses of outlying strongholds, he concentrated his elite Imperial regiments and the fiercest Hungarian cavalry into a single line at Linz, constructing an iron defense.\n\nOur vanguard forces crashed headlong into this steel wall. The commander's report was written with a trembling hand: '...their cannons roared like thunder; Hungarian cavalry cut into our flanks like the Reaper himself. Our formations were shattered. The soldiers fought bravely, but...' What followed was a series of staggering figures: over eight thousand casualties, thirty cannons abandoned, all supplies and baggage lost.\n\nWorse, the prolonged war had exhausted Bavaria's finances. The treasury was empty; even soldiers' pay was in arrears. Some noble lords began privately grumbling that the war was 'a mistake from the start'. More worryingly, intelligence suggested the Elector of Saxony, long watching from the sidelines, might be considering accepting Habsburg bribes to stab us in the back.\n\nThe situation deteriorated rapidly. [Emperor.Capital.GetName] seemed distant once more. The Habsburg army, emboldened by their initial victory, was regrouping, ready to crush us completely. Bavaria stood once again on the brink. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s military advisor somberly spread out a map showing the constantly shifting front lines.

Not only did we lose the crucial stronghold, but more fatally, the main army guarding the Upper Danube was nearly annihilated during the breakout. Remnants fled along the riverbanks, bringing increasingly desperate news: the army commander slain, all heavy artillery lost, the road to Regensburg now wide open.\n\nWithin the court, former loyalties wavered. In the dark corridors, nobles whispered, discussing whether to secretly contact [Emperor.Capital.GetName] to secure an exit. The Treasurer presented his report with a pallid face: the treasury was not only empty but burdened with massive war debts; fields lay fallow, plague began spreading in refugee camps.\n\nMost heartbreaking was the collapse of public confidence. Munich's squares no longer echoed with victory cheers, but with discontent over the war and fear for the future. Citizens who once supported the Euchite tolerance policy now questioned if it was all worth it—gambling the entire duchy's fate for a group of heretical believers.\n\nThe Habsburg envoy delivered a new 'peace proposal': unconditional surrender, disbandment of the army, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s abdication and exile, direct Imperial rule over Bavaria, and full eradication of the Euchites. These terms amounted to national extinction.\n\nLate at night, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood alone before the map. Red arrows representing enemy advances pointed from all sides towards Bavaria's heartland. The kingdom's territory was shrinking rapidly, like prey torn by wolves.\n\nAll rational calculations pointed to the same conclusion: defeat was inevitable.

Yet the partible inheritance law that [Root.Monarch.GetName] personally restored and strengthened was like an evil seed planted deep within the Empire's heart.\n\nNewly enfiefed princes and heirs of old noble houses built castles, recruited soldiers, and levied taxes in their respective territories, declaring themselves 'guardians of local order'. They swore superficial oaths of fealty to Munich, while secretly forging swords, sharpening blades, spreading spies, and even raising long-dusty family banners, claiming to be the true bloodline upholding ancient German glory. Clergy whispered prayers by candlelight in manor halls, libations poured upon cold stone slabs, while black-robed envoys and mysterious officers frequented under cover of night.\n\nFinally, on a night when the moon was obscured and the hue bloody, the horn of rebellion sounded abruptly. Church bells were forcibly tolled into an ominous knell; manor and castle alike ignited with treasonous fires.

EDG_BAV_event.70.d: "The rebellion finally ended amidst smoke and ruins. The fires once widespread across Germany gradually extinguished, leaving only charred villages and desolate fields silently recounting the price of blood and fire.\n\nInitially, to consolidate [Root.GetName]'s rule over all Germany, [Root.Monarch.GetName] instituted partible inheritance, slicing land and authority piece by piece, thinking rewards could buy eternal loyalty. Yet as years passed, these empowered local princes grew strong, their military power secured, their coffers overflowing, ultimately no longer content to bow beneath Munich's feet.\n\nIt began with sporadic disobedience and delayed orders, then refusal of taxes and private military expansion, until the first rebel banner rose silently on a rainy dusk; soon after, the whole German sky was stained red by war, rebellion spreading like wildfire. Vassals who once fought side by side under [Root.Monarch.GetName] now turned their spears, pointing longswords at Munich's throne.\n\nIn the darkest days, rumors spread like plague—some said the royal army was powerless to turn the tide, some said [Root.Monarch.GetName] would abandon parts of the realm for a humiliating peace, while others whispered in the shadows of taverns and churches: Germany's unity was but a fleeting bloom, destined to vanish like a bubble.\n\nBut [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not retreat. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stitched together shattered armies from the remnants of loyalty, uniting loyal knights, mercenaries, and city militia under a single banner. Old alliances were reread; the royal scepter was held high in pre-battle assemblies, reflecting a dim yet steadfast light in the pale morning.\n\nFinally, after a decisive battle, rebel banners were uprooted; their leaders either died amidst the chaotic fray or bowed their heads on cold stone steps to hear their sentences. Those local powers who once thought they could stand equal to Munich were pressed back into place by iron, blood, and writ.\n\nAs dust settled, the first rays of morning sunlight pierced thick clouds, falling upon broken walls. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the ruins, overlooking this land torn by war yet still familiar."

EDG_BAV_event.72.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] walked slowly through the broken walls and ruins of [EDG_BAV_event_72_country_target.Capital.GetName], the echoes of gunpowder smoke seeming to linger in his ears.\n\nAfter [Root.GetName]'s iron hooves trampled across Germany, we chose the path of partible inheritance, granting land, authority, and glory to local princes. We thought a network of royal kin and old nobles could stabilize the nascent hegemony, never expecting these former vassals, driven by power and ambition, would dare to contend with Munich.\n\nThe rebellion of [EDG_BAV_event_72_country_target.GetName] was but the most conspicuous wave in this storm. They raised the banner of revolt, claiming to defend 'the old order' and 'local liberties', seeking to tear apart the unity we forged with blood and steel. Relying on the walls and armaments of [EDG_BAV_event_72_country_target.Capital.GetName], they vainly attempted to drag [Root.GetName] back into the mire of princely fragmentation.\n\nNow, war banners once again unfurl upon the city towers, yet what flies high is no longer the rebel emblem, but the flag symbolizing [Root.GetName]'s authority. Resistance in the streets and alleys has been cleared, one by one; those who raised swords against us lie dead amidst the rubble or kneel before our armies. The voices that clamored for 'liberty' have been replaced by chains and interrogation; their 'new order', not yet formed, turned to dust and ashes in the flames.\n\nHowever, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows this is not the end, only the prologue. The ripples of partible inheritance still echo; every noble holding military power and fief could toy with the illusion of a crown on some night. The fall of [EDG_BAV_event_72_country_target.GetName] indeed shows the price of rebellion, yet it also exposes cracks in the foundations of [Root.GetName]'s rule.\n\nThe dust of smoke gradually settles; the walls return to silence."

EDG_BAV_event.74.d: "[Root.GetName]'s future depends on the abilities and insight of its next ruler. [Root.Heir.GetName] has shown exceptional intelligence since childhood, yet within these familiar lands, the knowledge and culture he can access remain limited.\n\nRecently, the Italian states have been at the forefront of art, scholarship, and statecraft. [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName] is particularly renowned, its capital [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.Capital.GetName] a gathering place for scholars and flowing with new ideas. Senior court officials propose that sending [Root.Heir.GetName] there to study would not only immerse him in advanced governance concepts and military arts but also allow him to befriend Italian dukes and scholars, gaining valuable connections and prestige for [Root.GetName].\n\nHowever, opponents worry that Italy's open culture and new ideologies might dilute [Root.Heir.GetName]'s reverence for tradition and faith, even making him question [Root.GetName]'s old customs and institutions. Ultimately, should [Root.Heir.GetName] remain at court for a traditional education from local nobles and clergy, or journey to [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.Capital.GetName] to shape his future amidst foreign splendor and temptations?"

Officials from [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName] report with admiration that this young heir from [Root.GetName] possesses unusual patience and enthusiasm for administrative details, already capable of independently reviewing complex financial statements and proposing reasonable reform suggestions.\n\nThey firmly assert that if [Root.Heir.GetName] maintains his current diligence and prudence, he will surely be able to govern [Root.GetName] with outstanding administrative skills in the future, becoming a truly diligent and enterprising monarch."

Whether bargaining over complex interstate treaties or navigating lavish banquets with well-chosen words, [Root.Heir.GetName] handles each situation with composure, often gaining additional prestige and benefits for [Root.GetName] through subtle verbal probing.\n\nThe officials are convinced that this period in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName] has taught [Root.Heir.GetName] how to resolve conflicts with words and forge alliances through personal connections.

Here, noble youths excel at horsemanship; military academies drill daily on formation changes, siege tactics, and field maneuvers. [Root.Heir.GetName] hones himself under the strict demands of instructors and fierce competition among peers.\n\nAs studies deepen, [Root.Heir.GetName] has developed more mature insights into military reforms, standing army construction, and discipline maintenance, and has begun contemplating how to transplant the experiences seen in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName] to [Root.GetName]'s armies. Regarding future personal leadership of [Root.GetName]'s forces, [Root.Heir.GetName] is no longer merely a naive royal member but is gradually growing into a military commander with sharp vision, adept at seeking victory amidst chaos.\n\nUpon returning home after completing his studies, [Root.Heir.GetName] may personally redraw the map of [Root.GetName]'s military strength, securing a place on the battlefield for [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.GetName] with a more resilient and sharp-edged army."

EDG_BAV_event.78.t: "Report from Officials in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName]"
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.well_connected: "Since [Root.Heir.GetName] arrived in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName], he has exhibited astonishing social aptitude.\n\nWhether dealing with old, stubborn local nobles or rising merchant nouveaux riches, [Root.Heir.GetName] always knows how to bridge distances with precisely appropriate courtesy, humor, and grace. Banquets, secret small salons, and whispered conversations in courtyard colonnades have made his name widely known among [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName]'s upper society.\n\nQuickly, [Root.Heir.GetName] has woven a complex web of connections: magistrates who sway city-state councils, merchant guild heads controlling port trade lifelines, and renowned families linked to major courts. Every valuable relationship is carefully maintained; not even a casual greeting or meeting is lightly wasted.\n\nAs studies deepen, [Root.Heir.GetName] understands that when ruling [Root.GetName] in the future, armies and decrees alone will not consolidate authority. True power often lies in an incidental private letter, a meticulously arranged wedding feast, or a grant untraceable in ledgers. This study abroad experience has taught [Root.Heir.GetName] how to weave scattered personal goodwill into an unbreakable political network."
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.patron_of_arts: "During his studies in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName], [Root.Heir.GetName] was soon captivated by the local artistic atmosphere.\n\nUpon first arrival, [Root.Heir.GetName] regarded painting and music merely as diversions outside class. But through frequent contact with painters, sculptors, and architects, [Root.Heir.GetName] gradually realized these seemingly 'useless' arts actually shape a nation's visage and soul.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName] watched painters blend colors in studios, gazed at magnificent frescoes on cathedral dome scaffolding, and first heard grand compositions for a new monarch's coronation in noble mansions. These experiences taught [Root.Heir.GetName] that patronizing art not only displays a ruler's refined taste but forges belonging and reverence in subjects' hearts.\n\nThus, [Root.Heir.GetName] began actively sponsoring young artisans whose potential was not yet widely recognized, providing materials, venues, and letters of introduction to court. Facing teachers' queries, [Root.Heir.GetName] merely smiled in response: when [Root.GetName] too possesses such magnificent cathedrals, squares, and galleries, our dynasty's glory will need no words."
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.careful: "Studying in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName] was not as relaxed and pleasant as outsiders might imagine. Complex city-state politics, delicate noble balances, and potential street riots at any moment made [Root.Heir.GetName] truly understand for the first time that ruling is never a craft to be undertaken lightly.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName] once witnessed a local magnate hastily decide on a fiscal matter, losing allies, prestige, and wealth within weeks. Thereafter, [Root.Heir.GetName] grew accustomed to writing extensive annotations on every document's margins, repeatedly verifying figures and clauses with mentors and local officials, preferring to delay decisions rather than sign anything without certainty.\n\nWorking alongside local officials, [Root.Heir.GetName] gradually learned to dissect the interests behind each decision: which merchant houses are affected by tax rate adjustments, which old nobles would be offended by wall repairs they refuse to fund, and how even a seemingly harmless protocol revision could be misinterpreted as a political signal.\n\nDaily polishing instilled in [Root.Heir.GetName] an almost instinctive caution: listening more than speaking, investigating more than ordering. In mentors' eyes, [Root.Heir.GetName] might sometimes seem overly cautious, but they had to admit—such an heir would never easily push [Root.GetName] into unnecessary peril."
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.charismatic_negotiator: "Disputes among [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName]'s city-states never lack shrill quarrels and mutual accusations. Yet, [Root.Heir.GetName] soon learned to break deadlocks in these tense situations with smiles and words.\n\nInitially, [Root.Heir.GetName] merely sat in a corner as an observer, recording each party's demands and bottom lines. But at some point, when negotiations stalled and representatives glared, people began expecting this young noble from [Root.GetName] to say something—a light-hearted joke seemingly irrelevant, a few praises for the other party's homeland history and customs, or apt quotes from sages—always subtly easing tension.\n\nIn one negotiation over tariffs and port rights, [Root.Heir.GetName] even suggested the parties temporarily leave the hall to stroll in a nearby monastery garden. Sunlight under arched corridors, people chatted while walking instead of facing cold tables. [Root.Heir.GetName] skillfully shifted topics from abstract 'rights' and 'honor' to mutual benefits and lasting peace from the agreement.\n\nWhen the final treaty was signed, a seasoned negotiator whispered in admiration: if this young man ascends [Root.GetName]'s throne one day, many problems once solvable only by swords may be replaced by a carefully orchestrated dialogue."
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.tactical_genius: "Unlike most noble youths who see war only as glory and medals, [Root.Heir.GetName] encountered cold maps, war games, and military reports in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName].\n\nAt the local renowned officer academy, [Root.Heir.GetName] daily recreated ancient battles, analyzing timing and routes of each maneuver. In class, instructors weren't satisfied simply praising a commander's bravery but persistently questioned: Why did he array here? How were supply lines maintained? If the enemy bypassed, how to respond?\n\nGradually, [Root.Heir.GetName] began instinctively spotting latent opportunities and traps from map contours and terrain. In one exercise, while other cadets advanced cautiously, [Root.Heir.GetName] bypassed frontal defenses, forced a river crossing at an overlooked ford, outflanked the enemy, and swiftly won the 'battle'.\n\nLocal veteran officers initially dismissed this as youthful recklessness. Yet subsequent drills proved [Root.Heir.GetName]'s judgments were both bold and thorough, always achieving maximum results with limited troops and supplies. Word spread quietly in military circles; people began comparing this heir from [Root.GetName] to legendary generals in history books."
EDG_BAV_event.78.d.strict: "During his study abroad in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName], [Root.Heir.GetName] had the chance to closely observe a city-state famed for strict military discipline and efficient bureaucracy.\n\nThere, whether gate guards or ledger-clerking scribes, everyone had clearly defined duties and reward-punishment clauses. A guard late once lost half a month's pay; a clerk falsifying numbers lost position and reputation in public trial. Initially, [Root.Heir.GetName] found such life stifling, but over time had to admit: it was these cold rules that kept the city-state orderly in turbulent times.\n\nDuring a municipal administration internship, [Root.Heir.GetName] faced a thorny case: a popular officer was exposed for embezzling military funds. Many pleaded for leniency, even suggesting offsetting with battle merits. Yet when people looked to [Root.Heir.GetName], they saw only calm, resolute eyes. After thorough investigation, [Root.Heir.GetName] supported strict legal punishment—confiscating property and publicly announcing the verdict as a warning.\n\nThis incident caused quite a stir locally, but it truly made [Root.Heir.GetName] understand that 'mercy' without principle only appears weak before corruption and indolence. Recalling experiences in [EDG_BAV_heir_education_italian_country_target.GetName], [Root.Heir.GetName] resolved inwardly: when holding [Root.GetName]'s reins, clear laws and strict discipline will surely reshape the kingdom's order."

For this, [Root.GetName] commissioned the architect and stuccoist Dominikus Zimmermann to design and decorate this sanctuary on the Wies meadow.\n\nFrom groundbreaking in 1745 to main completion in 1754, Zimmermann, building upon the Rococo style prevalent in Bavarian and Swabian regions, skillfully blended airy colonnades, flowing curves, and frescoes and sculptures rich in symbolic meaning. He meticulously controlled natural light streaming from high windows, making the altar and dome seem bathed in divine light, creating a mystical atmosphere transcending ordinary chapels.\n\nAround 1757, the intricate interior adornment was finally finished: gilded stucco, trompe-l'œil frescoes, and group depictions of the Virgin, saints, and pilgrims materialized faith's piety, suffering, and redemption into a tangible spatial experience. Pilgrims from across Bavaria and beyond flocked continuously, praising this 'Pilgrimage Church of Wies' as the earthly hall closest to heaven.\n\nNow, this artistic and architectural masterpiece funded by [Root.GetName] and crafted by Zimmermann's own hand is both a hymn to Catholic faith and a symbol of the aesthetic taste and political prestige of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s era, its fame spreading across Europe through pilgrims' and scholars' words."

Though its façade appears compact, its ambition is proclaimed through ornate columns, curves, and statues. Since construction began in 1733, the Asam brothers poured nearly all their effort into it: interior space pushed to ultimate drama, soaring altars, surging stone sculptures, layers of gold leaf adornment, and dynamic frescoes on the ceiling guiding believers' gaze and soul towards heaven.\n\nAs main work concluded around 1746, people first fully beheld the 'Asam Church, Munich'—where the Asam brothers realized their bold vision of late Baroque and Rococo art, and [Root.GetName] gained renewed fame across Holy Roman Empire states for its splendid, unique religious architecture.\n\nNow, this masterpiece is not only a testament to the two master artists' personal piety but also symbolizes the generous patronage and eternal pursuit of art and faith in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s era for [Root.GetName]."

Born in 1473, this artist was famed for his keen observation of detail and bold use of new techniques, enjoying high esteem among German states.\n\nIn the early 16th century, around 1508 onwards, Burgkmair was commissioned to create a series of grand images and woodcuts for the Emperor and princes. Among these, most celebrated by the world were his 'Augsburg Triumph' and related paintings of imperial family and knights for Emperor Maximilian I. These works displayed Imperial majesty and splendor while meticulously depicting city streets, armor heraldry, and citizenry, later seen as Augsburg's visual chronicle of this period.\n\nNow, a precious painting themed on [Root.GetName] is finally complete in the studio.

Altdorfer was not content with simply recreating ancient warfare; he crafted a near-illusory scene with extremely intricate detail and vibrant color: countless armors, flags, and weapons reflecting the cold glint of metal under light, seeming to pour forth from the painting.\n\nUnlike traditional battle paintings, this work elevates vast landscape to a protagonist. From a high, overlooking perspective, distant mountains, cities, and bays extend under clear skies; sunrise and sunset appear simultaneously on the horizon, symbolizing the old world's decline and new order's rise. Through this nearly impossible arrangement of light and space, Altdorfer transforms an ancient battle into an allegory of fate and power.\n\nWhen presented before [Root.Monarch.GetName] and court nobles, all were awed by its grand composition and meticulous brushwork. With this, [Root.GetName] not only demonstrates its reverence for art and learning but also, through this famous painting depicting Alexander's victory, hints at its own ambition for glory, expansion, and immortal fame. Art and power interweave in this 'Battle of Alexander at Issus', making one momentarily wonder whether the monarch in the painting is greater, or the [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazing upon it possesses grander aspirations."

EDG_BAV_event.91.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] finally stands on the banks of the Thames, overlooking this great metropolis hailed as the heart of Britain. The once-arrogant enemy of [Root.GetName] is now trampled beneath our iron hooves; London's gates lie open, its royal banners drooping in the wind.\n\nOnce-bustling streets are now shrouded in the smoke of war; church bells drowned by horns and shouts, while the Thames flows silently, as if witnessing this moment of fateful change. London Bridge is no longer a barrier blocking [Root.GetName]'s mighty host, but a gateway to a new order.\n\nAs our military standards are raised high upon London's walls, the prestige of [Root.GetName] will spread to every corner of the isles. From this day forth, this city that once represented British pride and power will compose an entirely new chapter for Bavaria under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
EDG_BAV_event.91.a: "London Bridge has fallen."

EDG_BAV_event.92.t: "Conquest of Madrid"
EDG_BAV_event.92.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] rides triumphantly into Madrid, watching the heart of Iberia fall silent under the banners of [Root.GetName].\n\nThe eagle that took flight from the Danube has now crossed the Alps and the Pyrenees, finally setting its talons upon this ancient capital that once ruled half of Europe. Nobles and citizens lining the streets gaze uneasily at the Bavarian army from foreign lands, while the gilded palaces and churches appear ever more solemn and fragile after the gunpowder smoke clears.\n\nThis is not merely a city's fall, but the end of an era. The once-invincible Armada has long rusted; the Spanish crown too must bow to the iron will of [Root.GetName]. Madrid's collapse proclaims to all Europe: a new order is forming, and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ambition extends far beyond this.\n\nBeyond plunder and oaths of submission, the true gain is intangible—fear, awe, shadows that haunt monarchs in their midnight dreams. Today's Madrid is but a stepping stone on [Root.GetName]'s march to conquer Europe; tomorrow, perhaps another capital will kneel to the sound of Bavarian war drums."
EDG_BAV_event.92.a: "Spanish affairs are always so delightful."

EDG_BAV_event.93.t: "Conquest of Paris"
EDG_BAV_event.93.d: "When the banners of [Root.GetName] flutter atop Paris's battlements, the once-proud heart of France has bowed its head beneath war and iron hooves.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] steps slowly onto a temporary review platform erected by the Seine, overlooking this city baptized by cannon fire. Palaces, boulevards, and bridges once symbolizing French glory now silently witness the arrival of a new era—Bavaria's era.\n\nParis's fall signifies not merely a war's outcome but a fundamental shift in Europe's power structure. Envoys, conspirators, and exiled nobles from various nations watch with terror, resentment, or secret glee, knowing that after today, [Root.GetName]'s will shall be the decisive force shaping Europe's destiny.\n\nBells ring from the heights of Notre-Dame, heavy and lingering, as if mourning the old order while whispering homage to the new hegemon. Now, a single decree from [Root.Monarch.GetName] can rewrite the future of the entire continent. Europe shall grow accustomed to breathing beneath Bavaria's shadow."
EDG_BAV_event.93.a: "The bells of Notre-Dame still echo."

EDG_BAV_event.94.t: "Conquest of Rome"
EDG_BAV_event.94.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands upon Rome's ancient walls, overlooking the city that once ruled the world, now submitting beneath the iron hooves of [Root.GetName].\n\nThe papal flag is slowly lowered from the heights of St. Peter's Basilica, replaced by the banner of [Root.GetName]'s authority snapping in the evening wind. The once-unshakable Holy See now lingers only by the decree of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nWith Rome's fall, no power in Europe remains to match the might of [Root.GetName]. Sword and cross have reasserted their hierarchy on this ancient land, and history will remember: on this day, Bavaria ceased to be merely a corner of the Empire, becoming Europe's true master."
EDG_BAV_event.94.a: "Has the Holy See finally deigned to lower its noble head?"

EDG_BAV_event.95.t: "Conquest of Constantinople"
EDG_BAV_event.95.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands at the heart of the former Eastern Roman Empire, overlooking this millennia-old city named Constantinople.\n\nOnce, this was the continuation of Rome, styling itself the world's true imperial capital. Yet times changed; the Empire vanished into history's torrent, leaving only crumbling walls and a dead honorific.\n\nToday, the banners of [Root.GetName] fly high above the Golden Horn; Bavarian iron hooves crush the last resistance. Church bells and military horns intertwine, declaring the old order's end and the new hegemon's birth.\n\nFrom the Danube to the Aegean, from the shadow of the Alps to the Bosporus Strait, the European continent trembles beneath [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s iron grip. [Root.GetName] is no longer just one among German states, but a new Rome spanning the continent, reforging order from north to south with steel and faith.\n\nConstantinople has fallen; [Root.GetName]'s glory has only just begun."
EDG_BAV_event.95.a: "They were thousands of kilometers from Rome, how dare they call themselves Romans?"

EDG_BAV_event.96.t: "Reform the Inheritance Law?"
EDG_BAV_event.96.d: "Partible inheritance has long tormented [Root.GetName].\n\nUnder the old system, each heir receives a portion of ancestral lands, supposedly for 'fairness', yet it has only brought territorial fragmentation and endless strife among the royal house. How many times have brothers turned into enemies, princes taken up arms, because of a will and a boundary? Once-integral territories are repeatedly dismembered into weak, isolated fragments.\n\nRecently, with yet another succession issue emerging, discontent with this archaic institution within and beyond the court has reached a peak. A far-sighted minister submitted a memorial before the throne, earnestly stating: without swift reform of inheritance law, [Root.GetName] will ultimately crumble in the next succession crisis. He suggests weakening collateral branches' rights to partition, concentrating primary territories in one hand to ensure continuity and stability of power and domain.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sits quietly upon the throne, listening to arguments in the hall: supporters praise this as ending the cycle of fragmentation; opponents warn it will provoke powerful nobles and the royal house, even sowing seeds of rebellion.\n\nNow, a simple yet profound choice lies before [Root.Monarch.GetName]—heed the call for reform, risking the wrath of the powerful to personally end the old system of partible inheritance, or maintain the status quo, letting this old path to division and decline extend further?"
EDG_BAV_event.96.a: "An excellent proposal. Let us implement it now!"
EDG_BAV_event.96.b: "This will offend too many. Better to let it be!"

EDG_BAV_event.97.t: "Inheritance Law Reform: The Issue of Ecclesiastical Influence"
EDG_BAV_event.97.d: "In advancing the first steps of inheritance law reform, [Root.Monarch.GetName] realizes the old system is deeply entangled with the Church's pervasive influence. Whether in principles of royal succession or arrangements for regency and guardianship, clergy always meddle in secular affairs in the name of 'divine will'.\n\nMany nobles within [Root.GetName] have long resented this, believing royal authority should stem from ancestral custom and merit, not a decree from a church altar. Yet the Church holds a broad base of believers in villages and towns; rashly reducing its influence will surely ignite pulpit fury and the anxiety of countless devout followers.\n\nNow, a key clause in the new inheritance law draft—whether to limit the Church's say in succession matters—has sparked fierce debate between court and clergy. Should this opportunity be seized to free the crown from bishops' shadows, or should compromise be made to avoid a direct clash between religion and monarchy at the reform's outset? [Root.Monarch.GetName] must decide."
EDG_BAV_event.97.a: "Keep those antiquated old men in the Church away from the crown!"
EDG_BAV_event.97.b: "This will offend too many. Better to let it be!"

EDG_BAV_event.98.t: "Inheritance Law Reform: The Issue of Daughters' Inheritance Rights"
EDG_BAV_event.98.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] ponders deeply over the next step in inheritance law reform.\n\nSeveral scholars and judges have submitted memorials to [Root.Monarch.GetName], pointing out the current law's extreme unfairness towards women: even if [Root.Monarch.GetName] has only daughters, these princesses are almost impossible to legally inherit the throne and territories of [Root.GetName]. Their rights are easily negated by archaic statutes.\n\nReformists argue that without granting daughters lawful inheritance rights in the absence of direct male heirs, [Root.GetName]'s throne may fall to collateral branches or even outsiders in the future, sparking succession disputes and noble civil war. Conservative nobles firmly oppose, calling this a blasphemy against 'ancestral law', claiming it would shatter the traditional patrilineal order and undermine the bloodline system upon which their lofty positions rely.\n\nAs debate over 'whether daughters should have inheritance rights' intensifies in court and noble assemblies, a choice concerning the dynasty's future direction finally lands upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s desk. Should the times and reason be followed, granting women inheritance rights, or should old custom be yielded to, continuing to exclude princesses from the line of succession?\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows this is not merely an amendment of legal text, but a fundamental shake-up of the entire inheritance system. Once this step is taken, there is no turning back."
EDG_BAV_event.98.a: "Daughters too should have inheritance rights!"
EDG_BAV_event.98.b: "This will offend too many. Better to let it be!"

EDG_BAV_event.99.t: "Inheritance Law Reform: The Issue of Partible Inheritance"
EDG_BAV_event.99.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes upon the mountain of documents before him, inevitably recalling that chilling year—1349.\n\nThat year, [Root.GetName] was brutally split in two amidst entanglements of blood and old institutions; territories were carved, authority weakened, princes and nobles seized the chance to make demands, imperial dignity reduced to bargaining chips. Partible inheritance, once seen as an ancient custom to placate the royal house and maintain kinship, nearly pushed [Root.GetName] into the abyss of fragmentation.\n\nNow, inheritance law reform has reached the critical third step; the most difficult knot is finally laid upon the desk—should partible inheritance be fundamentally abolished?\n\nMinisters supporting reform advocate primogeniture to ensure territorial and authority integrity, avoiding the nightmare of dismemberment with each monarch's death. Conservative royal house representatives angrily denounce this as 'depriving the clan's inherent rights', claiming it will provoke collective backlash from princes, not excluding recourse to arms.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows full well that a decision on this issue means drawing a definitive line with the old order—either forging a new, highly centralized [Root.GetName], or replaying 1349's humiliation through compromise and hesitation.\n\nUpon the throne, all eyes await [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s final answer."
EDG_BAV_event.99.a: "The division of 1349 must never be repeated!"
EDG_BAV_event.99.b: "This will offend too many. Better to let it be!"

EDG_BAV_event.100.t: "Inheritance Law Reform Concludes"
EDG_BAV_event.100.d: "Under the wise and resolute leadership of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the long-criticized system of partible inheritance in [Root.GetName] has finally been completely abolished.\n\nOn the day the new law was officially promulgated, the court and parliament held both the low murmurs of conservatives and the unconcealed relief of reformers. In the gaze of all, [Root.Monarch.GetName] solemnly declared: from this day forward, the territories and authority of [Root.GetName] shall no longer be dismembered among multiple heirs but shall be passed down as an indivisible whole.\n\nThe old clan factions must now face the reality of losing the means to expand their own power through partition, while officials and scholars supporting centralization believe this clears a fundamental obstacle for unified governance, tax reform, and military reorganization.\n\nWith the end of partible inheritance, a more stable and centralized [Root.GetName] is about to be born, and the ripples of this reform will profoundly affect every future change of power and territory in Bavaria."
EDG_BAV_event.100.a: "Bavaria's future is bright."

EDG_BAV_event.101.t: "Initiate Brewing Process Upgrade"
EDG_BAV_event.101.d: "While inspecting taverns and breweries in [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that the reputation of traditional Bavarian beer faces challenges from emerging brewers both within and beyond the borders. Though our beer remains widely popular, problems of outdated techniques and inconsistent standards grow increasingly evident.\n\nTo ensure Bavarian beer remains distinctive for decades, even centuries to come, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the gathering of master brewers, merchants, and scholars to jointly draft a systematic plan for brewing process upgrades. From ingredient selection to brewing procedures, to final flavor and quality control, the entire industry will undergo profound innovation."
EDG_BAV_event.101.a: "Scrutinize every step of the process strictly!"

EDG_BAV_event.102.t: "Brewing Process Upgrade: Ingredient Selection"
EDG_BAV_event.102.d: "The first step of the process upgrade is to start from the source.\n\nIn the past, breweries across [Root.GetName] acted independently regarding ingredients, with varying quality: some farmers passed off inferior goods, some merchants mixed low-quality barley to cut costs, affecting not only beer's consistent quality but gradually harming Bavarian beer's reputation.\n\nUnder [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s order, a stringent set of ingredient selection standards was established. Only barley grown in designated regions meeting grain size and moisture requirements can enter malt houses; hop aroma, bitterness, and origin are individually registered. To strengthen oversight, royal officials and guild representatives will conduct irregular inspections of warehouses and estates; anyone attempting adulteration will face severe punishment.\n\nWith high-quality ingredients continuously concentrated at designated breweries, fermentation becomes more stable, loss rates noticeably drop, and Bavarian beer production rises steadily."
EDG_BAV_event.102.a: "This will greatly increase brewery output."
EDG_BAV_event.102.a_tt: "Now, the §OBrewery§! will provide §G+75%§! §Ylocal production efficiency§!."

EDG_BAV_event.103.t: "Brewing Process Upgrade: Process Refinement"
EDG_BAV_event.103.d: "As the supply of high-quality ingredients stabilizes, [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns attention to the brewing process itself.\n\nMany Bavarian brewers still rely on experience and intuition to control mashing temperature, boiling time, and fermentation duration. While this creates certain unique flavors, it also leads to significant batch variations and hard-to-replicate 'accidental masterpieces'. With an expanding market, this instability has become a key constraint on beer sales.\n\nTherefore, the royal court funded scholars skilled in measurement and documentation to collaborate with seasoned master brewers, precisely quantifying each step of daily brewing: temperature ranges during mashing, stages and proportions for hop additions, cleaning cycles for fermentation vessels, and even storage conditions—all included in standard specifications. Workshops across the land were required to post unified procedures, subject to regular guild inspections.\n\nAs process refinement and standardization spread, beer produced in [Root.GetName] began to stabilize in quality. Merchants became more willing to place large orders for export abroad, and sales correspondingly surged."
EDG_BAV_event.103.a: "This will greatly increase brewery sales."
EDG_BAV_event.103.a_tt: "Now, the §OBrewery§! will provide §G+10§! §Yprovincial trade power§!."

EDG_BAV_event.104.t: "Brewing Process Upgrade: Flavor Improvement"
EDG_BAV_event.104.d: "With both ingredients and processes standardized, [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that merely being consistent is far from enough for Bavarian beer to stand out among many competitors—what truly makes it memorable is that unforgettable, unique flavor upon first taste.\n\nThe royal court ordered the gathering of the most renowned master brewers from major monasteries, traditional family breweries, and city guilds to conduct an unprecedented flavor trial. Malts roasted to different degrees were mashed and blended separately; multiple hop varieties were added at different sequences and timings to the boiling kettle; various fermentation temperatures and maturation durations were meticulously recorded. Each trial batch was scored by a dedicated tasting panel, with evaluations ranging from body fullness and aroma complexity to foam persistence and finish bitterness, all detailed and nuanced.\n\nAfter round after round of screening, a set of flavor profiles gradually took shape—preserving Bavarian traditional maltiness while achieving a more rounded and refreshing palate. These improved recipes were promoted as new guiding standards throughout the realm, enabling [Root.GetName]'s beer to achieve a genuine leap in quality."
EDG_BAV_event.104.a: "This will greatly enhance brewery quality."
EDG_BAV_event.104.a_tt: "Now, the §OBrewery§! will provide §G-5§! §Yprovincial unrest§!."

EDG_BAV_event.105.t: "Brewing Process Upgrade Complete"
EDG_BAV_event.105.d: "After years of effort, from field barley ears to foam in the glass, the beer industry of [Root.GetName] has undergone a complete transformation.\n\nDriven by [Root.Monarch.GetName], strict ingredient selection ensured stable and abundant output; refined processes allowed brewing scale to expand safely; and carefully improved unique flavor became Bavarian beer's most dazzling hallmark. Today, whether in local humble taverns or distant nobles' lavish banquets, mugs raised in cheer increasingly often contain beer from [Root.GetName]'s barrels.\n\nMerchant caravans from other countries began actively seeking purchases, attempting to emulate Bavarian techniques and standards, yet always struggling to fully replicate that distinctive taste combining pure maltiness with delicate bitterness. Among numerous beers, Bavarian beer gradually became a benchmark for measuring quality, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] was thus hailed by posterity as the ruler who reshaped Bavarian beer's golden age."

EDG_BAV_event.106.d: "Golden wort churns noisily in wooden barrels; the air is thick with the aroma of roast meat and malt mingling. Men and women in traditional dress raise mugs of frothing beer, singing boisterous, joyful drinking songs.\n\nIn the streets and squares of [Root.GetName], decorated with colorful flags and garlands, brewers from all regions proudly present their finest brews, vying for people's praise. As the sun sets, bonfires are lit; dancers whirl under firelight and starlight. Laughter, song, and the clear clink of glasses intertwine into a sea of merriment.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands at the heart of this grand festival, raising a glass amidst the throng and cheers of the populace, drinking deeply alongside nobles, merchants, and even common patrons. In this moment, the barriers of status and class seem diluted by the scent of beer, leaving only fervent hope for harvest, peace, and the future—this is the Oktoberfest revelry belonging solely to [Root.GetName]."

EDG_BAV_event.108.d: "In 1619, Frederick V von Wittelsbach, Elector Palatine, was elevated as King of Bohemia by Protestant princes and Bohemian nobles.\n\nThis young ruler hailed from the powerful House of Wittelsbach and was a symbolic figure of the Protestant Union. Married to Elizabeth, daughter of King James I of England, he was further seen as a potential core for the Protestant world. However, Frederick V lacked seasoned political acumen and faced immense pressure from the Empire and the House of Habsburg.\n\nIn 1620, the crushing defeat at the Battle of White Mountain shattered his royal dream; mocked by enemies as the 'Winter King' whose reign ended in a single winter. The Palatinate territories were also partitioned by Imperial forces and the Catholic League, forcing him into exile abroad, never returning to his lost kingdom in his lifetime."

EDG_BAV_event.109.d: "Since his youth studying in Italy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was deeply influenced by Renaissance ideas, now determined to bring those unprecedented concepts back to [Root.GetName].\n\nIn [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s view, old dogmas and prejudices have long constrained the kingdom's development, while emerging philosophy and art can enlighten minds and challenge conventions. If these avant-garde ideas are widely disseminated within court and academia, the gentry and officials of [Root.GetName] might examine traditional institutions with fresh perspectives, laying a solid conceptual foundation for future reforms.\n\nHowever, conservatives are already whispering in private, fearing this trend could shake the old order's foundations.

EDG_BAV_event.110.d: "His years in Italy allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to witness many learned men, whether proficient in theology, immersed in classics, or delving into natural philosophy, all inspiring admiration. Upon returning to [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName] deeply felt the kingdom's scholarship lagged; without support, it would eventually fall behind neighboring nations.\n\nThus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] proposed large-scale royal sponsorship of scholarship: expanding academies, inviting foreign scholars to lecture, and funding young students to study abroad. Some at court consider this merely a vanity project draining the treasury, while others predict that once scholarship flourishes, [Root.GetName]'s prestige and strength will be transformed."

EDG_BAV_event.111.d: "As reforms progress, [Root.Monarch.GetName] increasingly realizes that without an efficient and loyal cabinet, even the grandest blueprint remains on paper. Long entrenched, [Root.GetName]'s administrative organs are intertwined, positions often determined by lineage and heredity, overstaffed and inefficient.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to use Italian states as a mirror, systematically reorganizing cabinet structure and authority: merging overlapping offices, redefining departmental responsibilities, and attempting to appoint officials based on talent and knowledge rather than birth. This will undoubtedly affect many vested interests already secretly aligning in opposition. Yet if royal authority weathers this storm, [Root.GetName]'s governing machinery will operate with unprecedented smoothness."

Countless fiefs have nearly become princes' private kingdoms; they hold powers to levy taxes, conscript troops, even enact laws independently, nominally submitting to [Root.Monarch.GetName] while secretly acting as they please.\n\nThe fief reform proposed by [Root.Monarch.GetName] will limit noble privileges within their territories, requiring them to accept more unified kingdom statutes, with royal officials overseeing local finance and judiciary. This will weaken princes' actual independence, strengthening [Root.GetName]'s control over dependencies and vassals. Yet all understand that once reform begins, feudal nobles will not sit idle."

This will provide stable funding for future expansion and reform, yet inevitably be seen as a crude infringement on traditional rights.

However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacked sufficient prestige and an iron grip, only able to cautiously maneuver among princes and dukes, repeatedly compromising.\n\nWhen the blade of reform hesitated to fall, dukes entrenched across the land had already scented the blood of opportunity. They secretly allied in chambers, loudly denounced [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s 'usurpation' in council halls, and quietly bought loyalty and mobilized troops between manors and barracks. Each evasion and concession only left the ruler's authority like a flickering candle in the wind, tottering.\n\nFinally, the backlash struck suddenly. Lords once bowing low in court now raised banners of fragmentation. In the name of 'defending ancestral law' and 'protecting princely liberty', they openly carved up [Root.GetName]'s territories and authority. Royal armies either disintegrated or were absorbed by various factions; [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decrees were now worthless paper.\n\nThe once self-proclaimed legitimate royal authority of [Root.GetName] was now but a carcass to be divided and consumed. The court fell silent; the flag of unity slowly lowered from city walls, replaced by a forest of princely coats of arms. Partible inheritance was not abolished; instead, through this failed reform, witnessed by blood and fire, it became the blade that utterly shattered [Root.GetName].\n\nAfter power was completely partitioned, the name [Root.GetName] no longer represented a unified realm, but merely a bygone memory among dukes' tales.

Now, those credentials were publicly seized beneath [Root.GetName]'s military banners.\n\nLances and torn flags of routed troops still littered streets and alleys; church doors stood ajar, hymns cut short by warhorses' neighs.

EDG_BAV_event.117.d: "The last horn call echoed along the Main; Frankfurt's gates were forced open by the crash of battering rams and the roar of arquebuses. Once a bustling Imperial Free City filled with merchants and the clink of coin, it was now swallowed by smoke and dust; citizens hid behind shuttered windows, watching [Root.GetName]'s banners rise upon the city towers.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] ascended the newly captured walls, overlooking guildhalls and churches within. Its wealth came not from princely grants but from markets, tariffs, and credit; its pride stemmed not from any monarch but from its 'imperial immediacy' status—between princes' swords, Frankfurt had won a place with ledgers and seals. Now, that old talisman was torn; guild banners hung limp in the wind.\n\nSoldiers inventoried supplies and loot along streets; officials took over treasury silver, tax rolls, and toll stations. As order was being rewritten, a military scribe brought a report: in monastic libraries and wealthy merchant family vaults lay numerous rare manuscripts—copies of ancient imperial law codes and judicial precedents, secret records of state bonds, trade routes, redemptions, and diplomatic exchanges, even documents of electoral meetings and urban league correspondence.\n\nThese pages were treasures to scholars, keys to rulers: they could reveal how imperial order functioned, point to who owed debts, who colluded with enemies, whose privileges were weakest. Frankfurt was now in hand, but the 'imperial legacy' it left behind still whispered within the pages. Faced with this collection of books and archives, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must decide—to confiscate them tightly as tools for reshaping the new order, or preserve their dignity more gently, so the city might serve [Root.GetName] more swiftly?"

EDG_BAV_event.118.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Nuremberg"
EDG_BAV_event.118.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood upon Nuremberg's walls, examining [Root.GetName]'s banner snapping in the wind atop the towers, a trace of certainty in his expression.\n\nNuremberg was more than just a wealthy city. It was once a stage where imperial ceremony and princely politics intertwined: envoys came and went, decrees and petitions piled up, the clamor of imperial diets and whispers of compromise once echoed through halls and streets. Many German states were accustomed to seeking the cloak of 'legitimacy' and 'consensus' here, as if as long as the location and procedures remained, imperial majesty would not collapse.\n\nYet when gates opened and defenders scattered, the order sustained by decorum and convention crumbled. Bells still tolled, stone walls still stood, but they no longer endorsed the old imperial authority. However the self-styled emperor might explain, he could no longer summon princes or gild commands in Nuremberg's name. From this moment, it was no longer a symbol of imperial and princely checks, but proof that [Root.GetName] held the 'power of decision'.\n\nIn the shadow of the battlements, [Root.Monarch.GetName] understood: what Nuremberg's capture took was not merely land and taxes, but the illusion that the Empire could still function. Henceforth, echoing within this city would be new commands and a new order."

EDG_BAV_event.119.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Cologne"
EDG_BAV_event.119.d: "[Root.GetName]'s banners finally flew upon Cologne's walls; horn calls along the Rhine gradually faded in the damp, cold air. When the gates were forced open, this city of the Empire's most important cathedral—and the archbishopric behind it—was pried from long-term occupation, falling into the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nLike Aachen, Cologne was more than a mere fortress. For years, the Carolingian dynasty of Lotharingia, claiming to be the legitimate heir of the Frankish Empire, garrisoned and pressured here in the name of 'protecting the Church': the Archbishop's seal was coerced into endorsement; the pulpit and taxes of the Church were drawn into dynastic politics and requisitions. In the episcopal palace, clergy no longer discussed canon law and salvation but cautiously speculated which prayer might anger the occupiers.\n\nNow, the occupier's banner was torn down; new troops entered the holy city. Councilors and knights hastily changed their words in torchlight; guild leaders came pleading for protection with ledgers and keys; and those clergy once forced to comply remained silent beneath bell towers—they awaited not just a change of master, but to see whether this 'liberation' would become another shackle.\n\nFor [Root.GetName], Cologne's significance far exceeded walls and warehouses. Here, the cross had been used by Lotharingia to adorn its Carolingian legitimacy facade; now, that facade was publicly shattered. Cologne's bells still tolled: were they heralding the Archbishop's release from foreign coercion, or mourning the final demise of the Empire's old prestige—the answer would be determined by how [Root.Monarch.GetName] handled this henceforth."

EDG_BAV_event.120.d: "As Habsburg armies retreated, Wittelsbach banners marched north along roads and river networks. Berlin's gates were finally breached: defenses crumbled before cannon fire and assault ladders; defenders disarmed; citizens wavered between bells, flames, and rumors. This city, once seen as the Empire's frontier bastion and a crossroads of princely ambitions, now had to bow to [Root.GetName].\n\nBerlin might lack Aachen's ancient crown or Frankfurt's ledgers and seals, but its value lay in 'direction'. When [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s troops entered this northern strategic point, it demonstrated not just a tactical victory, but [Root.GetName]'s reach into both the Empire's heartland and periphery. To those princes still watching, this meant the Empire could no longer delay fate with distance, geography, or old alliances; if Berlin changed flags today, it might be their turn tomorrow.\n\nMore importantly, Berlin's fall acted like a hook, tearing the Empire's remaining connections and confidence. Road passes, military posts, and tax sources were re-seized; northern espionage and diplomatic traffic would be forced to detour; the illusion of 'still recoverable' that sustained the old order was utterly torn apart. The Wittelsbachs' steps to expand family power would not halt here—and the cities and symbols that could still be called imperial were few and far between."

EDG_BAV_event.121.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Mainz"
EDG_BAV_event.121.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s battle banner snapped by the Rhine; Mainz's towers had their old emblems completely removed. Inside the gates, dust still hung in the air, but church bells rang urgently, as if trying to suppress the fear brought by blades with prayer.\n\nMainz was never just a city or a riverbank. As an archbishopric, it was once a hub of imperial ecclesiastical power, a throat through which decrees, taxes, and seals passed. Yet its status was also brutally rewritten: when the Archbishop of Mainz defied Emperor Sigismund, the Electoral dignity was stripped in the name of 'punishment' and granted to the Archbishop of Milan. Since then, Mainz's pulpits remained, like a king without a crown—prestige diminished, voice suppressed, even prayers carrying echoes of humiliation.\n\nNow, [Root.GetName] seized this province with steel and flame, reopening that old wound. Clergy wandered between episcopal palace and monastery, unsure for whom to pray; guilds and citizens within the city feared plunder while secretly calculating: would this new master restore Mainz's dignity, or merely use it as a tool for taxation and garrison? The more astute understood that what truly stung the states was not the walls' fall, but a signal—the Empire's weakness in wielding the authority to decide Church and Electoral matters.\n\nWith Mainz changing banners, imperial authority shook once more. Some were enraged, some fearful, some accepted in silence: the old order where an emperor's decree could strip or grant was being remeasured by new power."

EDG_BAV_event.122.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Trier"
EDG_BAV_event.122.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] unrolled the latest battlefield report, gaze halting on the same sentence: Trier's gates had collapsed under days of cannon fire. [Root.GetName]'s banners rose upon the walls; winds from the Upper Rhine swept over ruins and campfires, carrying the scent of victory into this ancient episcopal city.\n\nTrier was once one of the Empire's steadiest frontier keys, a symbol: the archbishop's crosier and Electoral dignity allowed it not only to guard a city but to speak in imperial politics. Yet like Aachen and Cologne, it too had long been occupied by the Carolingian dynasty of Lotharingia in the name of 'legitimacy'. Occupiers garrisoned troops in monastery storehouses, wrote levies into 'protection fee' ledgers, forced the episcopal court to endorse them in decrees and prayers; in their telling, Trier was not Church territory, but part of the Carolingian inheritance.\n\nNow, iron and fire tore that pretense to shreds. Clergy murmured prayers amidst collapsed walls, unsure for whose souls to plead; citizens huddled under eaves, fearing both new levies and old masters' retribution; while [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s legions marched in ordered ranks through streets, announcing with formation and banner: this city no longer served Lotharingia's dynastic myth.\n\nTrier's fall took not only fortress and tax source, but the occupiers' 'legal stage' for self-justification. When an Electoral archbishopric could be forcibly reclaimed, states had to acknowledge: the old balance sustained by titles, ceremonies, and lineage was loosening under [Root.GetName]'s pressure. Some saw this as another collapse of imperial majesty; others heard it as the new era's trumpet—an era no longer dominated by Carolingian slogans, but redrawn by power and will."

EDG_BAV_event.123.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Lübeck"
EDG_BAV_event.123.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] spread the latest territorial map, gaze resting on that point along the Baltic coast: Lübeck. That Free City once hailed as the Empire's northern pearl, the heart of the Hanseatic League, was now colored [Root.GetName]'s hue, as if even sea winds had shifted direction.\n\nIn the harbor, merchant ships still entered and departed, masts like forests, yet forced to hoist unfamiliar flags; warehouse and guildhall doors opened and closed as usual, but each opening seemed a reminder: this city's 'freedom' was no longer guaranteed by Imperial privilege and ancient charters. Guild elders cursed softly in secret chambers, scheming resistance and ransoms, but ultimately had to affix seals before [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s orders—not from conviction, but because harbor chains, tariff ledgers, and camps outside the walls told them the era of bargaining was over.\n\nLübeck excelled in sustaining power with contracts and silver, not walls and knights. Yet when land legions approached, cannons aimed at the quays, the network the Hanse prided itself on seemed fragile: a single embargo, a blockade, could suffocate trade routes and make allies hesitate. Citizens once styling themselves a 'Free City' now had to bow to a distant ruler—they lost not only autonomy over tax rates and customs posts, but the authority to command northern cities.\n\nWhile Imperial princes still tore at each other over doctrine, elections, and titles, [Root.GetName] rewrote the rules more directly. Lübeck's change of banner declared: the Empire's old order crumbled not only in princely council halls but also along trade routes and seaports; the new hegemon arose not from votes and ceremonies, but steadily entered upon grain roads and gun emplacements."
EDG_BAV_event.123.a: "The Hanseatic Queen weeps behind her hands."

EDG_BAV_event.124.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Hamburg"
EDG_BAV_event.124.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood upon Hamburg's walls, overlooking the city's crisscrossing canals and harbor's forest of masts. Bells still tolled from afar, yet no longer bore witness to old privileges and oaths; merchants' warehouses remained stacked with crates, cranes on docks still rose and fell, but all this bustle was forced to realign beneath [Root.GetName]'s banners.\n\nHamburg always took pride in its 'freedom'. It relied on ports, tariffs, and credit for standing; maintained order with guilds and councils; preferred resolving disputes with contracts, not vassal oaths. Yet when gates opened, North Sea's salt wind carrying smoke struck their faces, this city finally understood: before cannon and military provisions, even the most meticulous ledger lost weight. Elders had to surrender keys and tax rolls, exchanging cautious submission for streets not wholly plundered; while soldiers' footsteps spread along embankments and bridges, as if measuring new boundaries.\n\nFor [Root.GetName], Hamburg's significance far exceeded a wealthy city. It was a true gateway to the sea: it could redirect northern trade flows, gather salt, timber, grain, and military supplies under new customs posts; it could teach incoming fleets where to hang flags and to whom to pay duties. Imperial states would surely tremble—for Hamburg's submission meant northern commercial lifelines were being rewritten; many forces relying on sea routes and port mediation would for the first time feel a visible hand at their throat.\n\nAs harbor tides slapped the embankments, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew clearly: the Empire's power balance tilted not only in electoral halls, but also silently shifted on wharves and shipping lanes. With Hamburg now in hand, the North Sea was no longer distant, but a direction [Root.GetName]'s will could reach."
EDG_BAV_event.124.a: "The gateway to the North Sea has opened."

EDG_BAV_event.125.t: "Capture the Imperial Province: Stuttgart"
EDG_BAV_event.125.d: "[Root.GetName]'s main army approached Stuttgart under [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s personal command. When cannons opened fire, dust burst from stone crevices in the walls; the gates finally collapsed under repeated impacts. The defenders resisted fiercely, yet once outer walls fell and barricades were pushed back street by street, any courage only bought slower defeat. Street fighting lasted hours, until the last enemy banner was torn from the towers; the city's clamor gradually subsided amidst exhaustion and fear.\n\nStuttgart's significance extended beyond being an 'Imperial province'. To the House of Habsburg, it was not merely fortress and tax source, but more like a cradle of family memory, the ancestral symbol and proof of the eagle banner's legitimacy. Hence, when [Root.GetName]'s banners rose upon the walls, this blow did not just weaken the Empire's arm—it seemed to directly break the spine by which the Habsburgs sustained their prestige.\n\nOfficials within hurriedly sealed archives; guild leaders came pleading for protection with keys; noble families waited for judgment in church porticoes. Distant princes and courtiers would also have to reassess: if even the Habsburgs' 'place of origin' could not be held, how much weight remained in so-called Imperial authority? On the Empire's power chessboard, [Root.GetName] was step by step approaching the center, and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s name would be engraved in everyone's memory alongside Stuttgart's fall—as a deep fissure in the old order's collapse."

EDG_BAV_event.126.t: "Empire's Twilight"
EDG_BAV_event.126.d: "Wittelsbach banners flew high along the Danube; the Habsburg Emperor was forced to retreat amid successive battles and unavoidable surrender. The Holy Roman Empire, once sustained by crown, decree, and ancient oath, now rapidly loosened and collapsed amidst cannon fire and fissures. We used victory to reshape the map: vast Imperial lands were incorporated into nascent family authority; princes either bowed in submission or struggled to preserve themselves; the old rigid hierarchy and order could no longer hold.\n\nYet the Empire did not vanish. Remnant city-states and territories still adorned their facades with old legalities, warming each other with the 'Empire' name, as if as long as ceremony remained, the Mandate of Heaven could continue. They still had walls, but lacked reinforcements; could still swear oaths, but lacked power to fulfill them. Each delay only added another layer of dust upon ruins, yet might also provide time for princes in desperate straits to ally and counterattack.\n\nWe stand on the threshold of the endgame: either issue an ultimatum, demanding remaining princes choose submission and integration under our new order, letting this twilight conclude swiftly; or temper the edge temporarily, avoiding forcing remnants into alliance and sparking new fronts and prolonged attrition. The Empire's twilight fades; how its last breath falls depends on our decision now."

Rumors say he traveled circuitously, evading both the Papacy's wrath and the probes of princes; yet Bavaria was known for tolerance and religious freedom—here, different pulpits could debate, dissenters need not be dragged to the stake immediately.\n\nHe came not with armies or gold, but with a bundle of manuscripts and a conscience unwilling to stay silent. Some at court worried: sheltering him would be declaring war on the old order. Others anticipated: allowing him to speak here might make [Root.GetName] a gathering place for new ideas, winning scholars and popular support, yet also inviting pressure from neighbors and the Church.\n\nNow, Martin Luther waits outside the hall. He asks little—a room for writing and preaching, safety from pursuit, and a chance to state his case publicly. How shall we respond to this guest of the storm?"

EDG_BAV_event.129.t: "The Plight of the Palatinate"
EDG_BAV_event.129.d: "News arrived that the Elector of Franconia died without heir, loosening the order once maintained by princely consensus. The Palatinate seized the power vacuum, declaring itself a state, attempting to draw borders with a proclamation for respite—yet proclamations can found states but not authority.\n\nThe new regime's foundations are unstable; court and territorial nobles harbor separate calculations. Neighbors watch, ready to intervene in the name of 'mediation'. The Wittelsbach Count Palatine ruling the region knows full well: this so-called independence merely places him on a blade's edge. Without strong support, the Palatinate will soon become a bargaining chip among nations.\n\nThus, he looks towards Munich—the Bavarian branch of the same Wittelsbach bloodline. An envoy brings a plea: willing to forge bonds of kinship and interest in exchange for protection and recognition. The Palatinate could choose to go further—reintegrate into a more stable power structure through union, inheritance, or merger. Or it could retain existing titles and traditions, letting both branches hold their positions, only assisting each other in crises.\n\nNow, the fate of the Palatinate and the future of Wittelsbach lie together upon our table: is this an opportunity to consolidate family lands and forge a new order, or an adventure that could tear old traditions apart and invite wolves to circle?"

Nominally, we rule Bavaria, yet we are constrained by countless local customs: the same levy calculated multiple times, the same lawsuit shuttled between venues, conscription and corvée delayed repeatedly due to unclear jurisdiction.\n\nNow, courtiers and officials propose reorganizing the realm with 'Administrative Circles': dividing territories into several circles based on governance and military needs, unifying taxation, judiciary, and archives, clarifying official duties, allowing commands to travel directly from Munich to villages. This might replenish the treasury, speed mobilization, and weaken the constraints of princes and the Church; yet touching vested interests will provoke resistance, and localities may respond to central intervention with unrest.\n\nThe time has come to decide—we must wager a reform reshaping Bavaria, at the cost of order and efficiency."

Their pike-and-shot tactics, combined with new matchlock muskets, are far more effective than our reliance on traditional knightly charges. Our armies were severely depleted in the civil war. To truly deter neighbors, we must reform.'\n\nHe paused, gaze lowered to the table. 'I have drafted a plan aimed at forming a new army—leaner, more reliant on infantry and firearms. This requires... using part of the income originally belonging to the royal demesne.'\n\nHe gently pushed the document forward.

EDG_BAV_event.133.d: "Dust swirled over the newly opened training ground outside Ingolstadt; horn calls echoed in the open space. There were none of the trappings or finery of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s old tiltyard, only obstacles, targets, and timing lines erected according to Wolfgang's new drill manual. To test reform results and steady morale, a 'tourney' emphasizing infantry coordination and firearm operation was underway.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] attended personally, gaze sweeping across field formations. Movements were still somewhat unpolished, yet on command they advanced in unison—soldiers no longer relying on individual valor but required to be reliable as components.\n\nAt the field's center, rapid loading and firing drills with matchlocks were assessed. A young soldier, nervous, made consecutive errors in procedure; the squad leader's expression darkened, and the formation stirred slightly.\n\nThen, someone rose from the viewing stand and walked onto the field—Wolfgang. He did not publicly reprimand, only approached the soldier, took the matchlock, and demonstrated for all: cleaning, loading powder, tamping, loading ball, setting match—a seamless sequence, brief and precise. Then raising, firing, the shot striking the bullseye.\n\nHe handed the weapon back, spoke a few low words, lightly patted the soldier's shoulder armor, signaling a return to position.\n\nThe field grew quieter, not noisier. The soldiers looked at their commander; beyond awe, there was an added layer of credibility: these rules were not just on paper; the one enforcing them could first achieve them.\n\nWolfgang turned, his gaze passing through the dust, briefly meeting [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s on the viewing stand. His face held none of the youth's eagerness, only the composure of one bearing responsibility. Yet in that moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could still see in him the shadow of the past: the young knight who once won praise by breaking force with skill on the tournament field. Times and weapons had changed; what remained was the demand for skill—and the self-proven result."

EDG_BAV_event.134.t: "Military Academy"
EDG_BAV_event.134.d: "Over several years, Ingolstadt had long ceased to be merely a heavily garrisoned border fortress. Under Wolfgang's planning and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s support, a clearly regulated complex rose on the city's outskirts: training grounds, lecture halls, workshops, and a library interconnected—not shaped as a citadel but structured by discipline and method: the Royal Bavarian Military Academy.\n\nAt its inauguration, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attended personally. He was greeted not by the clamor of a parade, but by a well-lit lecture hall: Wolfgang stood among officer cadets—both noble scions and youths of common birth. He pointed to a map of Bavaria and neighboring states spread on the wall, speaking not of a charge or a battle line, but of things harder to write into battle reports.\n\n'...What you will command in the future is not just companies. Border walls can hold temporarily, but not against prolonged decline. Military rations, roads, storehouses, popular will—these are not glorious, yet they determine the length of war, and whether peace is possible. Victory can come from a correct risk; endurance must come from complete national strength. What you learn here is to place force where it should be.'\n\nThe words were restrained, the conclusion clear. The hall fell silent briefly before polite applause arose.\n\nLater, Wolfgang accompanied [Root.Monarch.GetName] through the complex. In the teaching and research room, displaying sand tables and models of new artillery, he paused, speaking as if of a long-settled matter:\n\n'Once, someone promised me a crown—that was merely a misjudgment. What you gave me is more practical: making the sword useful, and letting the one who wields it not need ambition to prove himself. This academy will be heavier than a crown, for it must bear future responsibility.'\n\nThis was neither justification nor oath, but a soldier's confirmation of order and legacy after setting aside personal honor and disgrace. Thus, the academy's completion meant more than a building: it integrated the art of war into institution, turned experience into method, made individuals into a system."

Approaching, he realized it was not a military manual or atlas, but a hand-copied Bible.\n\n'What are you seeking?' the King asked.\n\nWolfgang closed the pages, looking up calmly. 'Answers. About power, about faith, also about—the chivalry we spoke of in our youth.'\n\nHe gazed towards the distant dusk, voice not loud yet clear: 'I once thought chivalry meant fighting for the Lord, wielding the sword for truth, regardless of cost. That certainty made me point the blade at you, and at those who should have been protected. I took it as legitimacy.'\n\n'In Ingolstadt, at the academy, I can teach them how to march, how to array, but I've been thinking: how to answer 'for what we fight'.' He paused briefly before continuing, 'Now I understand: chivalry does not depend on which god you name, nor which banner you follow. It depends on how you use power—whether your sword shows restraint, whether your victory leaves order, whether your decisions free more people from fear.'\n\nWolfgang turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName], his gaze clear, seeking no justification: 'You made me understand this, not through admonition, but through bearing. Responsibility to the state, patience for peace, and tolerance for people like me—these are closer to its essence than any victory.'\n\nThe evening breeze brushed through foliage; the remaining light dimmed. The words held no oath, only a belated, practicable measure."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] and Wolfgang stood side by side before the altar, both in formal attire, bearing no weapons.\n\nThis was not a coronation nor an oath of fealty, but a mass for those fallen in the civil war: seeking peace for the departed, future for the kingdom. As the choir's echoes faded beneath the dome, [Root.Monarch.GetName] glanced sidelong at his brother. Wolfgang gazed at the sacred image, his expression restrained and calm; the former agitation and shadows seemed to recede further, leaving only stability after weariness.\n\nAfter the ceremony, [Root.Monarch.GetName] did not give a lengthy address, only raised a hand in signal. The court chamberlain brought forth a tray covered in blue velvet: it held neither scepter nor sword, but a somewhat worn wooden eagle—the one once quietly passed through prison bars.\n\nThe King personally picked up the wooden eagle and offered it to Wolfgang. This time, there were no iron bars between them.\n\n'Its broken wing,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] said calmly, 'has been mended.' He paused, then added, 'As have we.'\n\nWolfgang received it with both hands, fingertips brushing over the repaired, polished grain. His expression briefly complex, then cleared. He did not kneel nor swear an oath, only bowed his head slightly and pressed the eagle to his heart.\n\nAll present understood: some rifts cannot be erased, but can be acknowledged, repaired, and integrated into a new order. From this moment, the kingdom's most unshakable part lay not in documents and armies, but in this re-established boundary—and the decision to still abide by it."

# EDG_BAV_event.141.d: "Recently, a group of local capitalists in [EDG_BAV_event_141_province_target.GetName] jointly petitioned, proposing a plan to establish a modern brewery in the province. They point out the region's abundant high-quality barley and hops, ample labor force, and natural advantages for developing a beer industry. The new factory is expected to create hundreds of jobs and boost local economic vitality through taxes and trade. However, this may also intensify competition with traditional breweries and even affect grain supply balance."
EDG_BAV_event.141.d: "Recently, several wealthy merchants and guild leaders from [EDG_BAV_event_141_province_target.GetName] jointly submitted a petition, offering to fund the construction of a larger-scale beer brewery in the province, complete with a malt house, storage cellars, wells, and other facilities. They claimed that local barley and hop supplies were ample, the water source pure, and there were sufficient apprentices and laborers available. If permitted, it would not only ensure stable beer supplies for towns and military needs but also generate levies and taxes, invigorating markets and trade routes. However, concerns were raised: a large workshop granted privilege would inevitably squeeze out smaller breweries and old guild regulations; diverting more grain for brewing could drive up food prices in lean years, sparking popular discontent.

EDG_BAV_event.149.t: "Maria's Wisdom"
EDG_BAV_event.149.d: "At the council meeting, debate over northern border tax reform had lasted all morning. Nobles were deadlocked, each holding their own view; the chamber was suffused with stifling staleness. Just as Alois prepared to force a resolution, a soft yet clear voice spoke from the side.\n\n'Perhaps we could reference Lombardy's graduated tax system?'\n\nAll turned towards the voice—it was Alois's wife, Maria of the House of Visconti. She usually listened quietly on the sidelines, but now rose and walked to the map, gently pointing at several northern villages.\n\n'According to Lord Wolfgang's inspection report last year, these villages' harvests differ by more than threefold. A fixed tax would be unbearable for farmers in poor regions.' She produced a parchment scroll with a meticulously drawn tax curve. 'Yet taxing based on income share could ease burdens in impoverished areas while gaining more revenue from wealthy ones.'\n\nThe Treasurer stared wide-eyed at the drawing: 'Such intricate calculations... How did my lady...?'\n\n'In Milan, my father once resolved Genoese trade disputes with this method.' Maria smiled slightly, turning to Alois. 'More importantly, this would let border folk feel the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s justice and mercy.'\n\nThe previously contentious nobles gradually quieted; some began seriously studying her proposal. Alois watched his wife's calm profile in the light and shadow, recalling his father often saying: true wisdom often hides in the most unexpected places."

EDG_BAV_event.150.t: "Behind the Scenes"
EDG_BAV_event.150.d: "One evening with drifting snow, Alois reviewed border outpost reports in his study, brow furrowed. A secret report from a northern forest patrol mentioned several suspicious camp traces, suspected to be a minor noble discontent with tax reform secretly gathering men with ill intent. The report's end suggested preemptive, secret arrests.\n\nAs he pondered the action's pros, cons, and risks, Maria entered with a cup of warmed wine. She gently placed the cup by her husband's hand, her gaze inadvertently sweeping over the map and secret report on the table, yet she did not inquire about state affairs.\n\n'This afternoon, I received an elderly lady from the north,' Maria's voice was warm as the room's hearth fire. 'She is the widow of old Baron von Eschenbach, traveled three days just to request an audience.'\n\nAlois looked up. The name von Eschenbach caught his attention—the very minor noble family mentioned in the secret report.\n\n'The old lady was in tears,' Maria continued calmly. 'She said her only son, young Conrad, was not rebellious at heart, merely misled by a few ill-intentioned companions and, fearing inability to pay the new tax after last year's poor harvest, momentarily foolish. She pleaded not for forgiveness, but for a chance to let her son turn back from error and voluntarily confess. She is willing to mortgage the family's last woodland to make up the tax.'\n\nMaria looked into her husband's deep eyes, softly adding: 'A desperate mother sees truth far clearer than any spy. Sometimes, offering a step down is better than dispatching an army.'\n\nAlois fell into thought. He looked again at the report recommending harsh measures, then at his wife's gentle, wise face. He realized Maria hadn't mentioned this by chance. In her way, before a possible tragedy, she skillfully revealed another side of the problem and offered a wise solution."

The authority sustaining the House of Visconti collapsed overnight: offices lacked signatories, armies obeyed separate commands, nobles and guilds vied for city defenses and tax warehouses, even surrounding towns began asserting independence. Lombardy was no longer a fief to be 'inherited', but a spreading power vacuum—whoever reached first might grasp both crown and torch.\n\nAnd we held a document that could dress 'intervention' as 'order': the Treaty of Milan. It once promised in the Visconti name, now becoming a double-edged sword as they fell. If we choose to fulfill the treaty, we could assume Lombardy's rule under a legal banner, restoring law, grain order, and military discipline to Milan. Yet this also means stepping into a quagmire—we must face probing and counterattacks from factions within, and bear external powers' covetous eyes under the name of 'aiding Milan'.\n\nIf we choose to stand aside, we avoid being drawn into Lombardy's storm, letting the city decide its own fate through struggle. Yet the treaty becomes scrap paper; our credibility and promises suffer. Moreover, Milan's chaos won't stop at its walls: once order completely dissolves, refugees, banditry, and hostile armies will spread along trade routes and mountain passes, eventually impacting our own borders and prestige.\n\nNow, the question is not whether Milan needs protection, but whether we are willing to pay the price for the responsibility signed in the treaty."

EDG_BAV_event.158.t: "Shock"
EDG_BAV_event.158.d: "Night hung over Munich like a damp, cold blanket, yet the palace corridors remained brightly lit. Reflections from silverware danced on walls; music and whispers swirled beneath vaults—everything seemed routine ceremony: attendants' footsteps precise, nearly soundless; guards' armor and sashes impeccable as in every rite. Yet within this 'perfection', the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] suddenly sensed an ineffable discord: a momentary stagnation in the air, as if breath were held, the entire palace awaiting a signal.\n\nIt happened swiftly. A figure that should have belonged among inner court servants darted from the crowd's edge, movements adept, not spur-of-the-moment. Cold light slid from a sleeve—a soundless bolt of lightning. Had a guard not instinctively stepped forward, the blade would have pierced through ceremonial folds straight to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s chest. The dagger grazed fabric, leaving a small yet glaring tear. What followed was not a scream, but a more terrifying silence—the silence of those who had lived at court long enough to know: once a blade is drawn within the palace, things are no longer as simple as 'the assassin subdued'.\n\nThe guard reacted half a beat late; the clash of steel finally shattered the dead quiet. The assassin was pinned down, face deliberately obscured, as if prepared to be unrecognizable. More unsettling: he bore no tokens pointing to an employer—no family crest, no origin papers, not even common religious amulets; only a crushed wax seal fragment and a few thin threads hidden in his boots—as if someone had considered all consequences of 'being caught' for him.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised a hand to halt an immediate execution order. Blood flowing instantly wouldn't bring reassurance; instead, it would make all think truth had been buried. The chamberlain urgently reported: tonight's inner court access roster showed two alterations; kitchen meal delivery was earlier than usual; the craftsman responsible for replacing corridor candlesticks was temporarily reassigned; even the guard shift password was 'routinely updated' that afternoon. These scattered discrepancies stitched together a conclusion—someone within the palace assisted, and the assistant not only knew procedures but could mobilize resources.\n\nThat night's banquet was forcibly halted; nobles withdrew hastily between alarm and decorum, each gauging others' expressions from the corner of their eyes: who left too quickly, who lingered too long, whose hands trembled, who remained overly calm. After palace gates closed again, only the crackle of braziers remained in the interrogation room. The assassin was revived, questioned, pressed to speak by all means legal and illegal—yet after a brief, derisive laugh, he bit through a poison capsule hidden between teeth. As if an invisible chain sealed his mouth: death before speech.\n\nCourt physicians were helpless; the body soon grew cold, while suspicion heated every corner. Who believed they could reach the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s side even in Munich's palace? Who dared point a blade at this nation's symbol? More crucially: if this attempt failed, would the next be more precise, more silent, more deadly?\n\nThus, a secret order was issued late at night: seal the roster, inventory keys, re-examine the guard, interrogate all with access to the inner court—investigation would proceed with utmost severity. Yet the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] also understood: the true danger was not the fallen assassin, but the hand hidden in palace shadows; it could send someone into the palace, and could also erase evidence."
EDG_BAV_event.158.a: "Even Munich's palace is not an absolute sanctuary for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

EDG_BAV_event.159.t: "Clarity Emerges"
EDG_BAV_event.159.d: "The shadow of the failed assassination did not dissipate with the body's removal; instead, like moisture seeping into stone cracks, it slowly spread between palace and city. When the investigation began, everyone thought following 'institutional leads' like rosters, passwords, and passes would unravel the source like a skein of yarn. Yet days passed, leads either dead-ended mid-air or were skillfully diverted into meaningless paths.\n\nThe official in charge of the inner court presented neat stacks of copied records, claiming alterations were merely 'clerical errors'. Stewards accused each other, yet all pointed to temporary laborers long departed. Guard officers swore passwords never leaked, yet when checking recovered passes, two unaccountable brass tokens appeared—as if keys to the palace were forged from thin air. More frustrating, all potentially contacting the assassin showed near-uniform forgetfulness: they remembered details yet 'accidentally' omitted key points; they could describe corridor candlelight's brightness but not the servant's eye color.\n\nUnsettling rumors began circulating in the city: some said the assassin came from abroad, a foreign spy; some said a radical sect's fanatic; others boldly hinted this was the prelude to court factional strife. Each version could shake public trust, and worst of all—they contradicted each other yet all seemed 'plausible'. An invisible pen seemed deliberately writing chaos in streets and alleys, exhausting all in distinguishing truth.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] removed investigative authority from the regular judicial system, assigning it to trusted internal personnel and military inspectors. After new orders, palace security became unprecedentedly strict: night patrols doubled, warehouse seals replaced, servants forbidden to leave posts, nobles requiring advance submission of entourage lists for audiences. Yet the tighter the guard, the more a strange countereffect was felt—someone deliberately made 'security' cumbersome. Extra checks slowed supplies; frequent password changes confused lower ranks; even loyal guards began complaining of mutual distrust. The conspirators seemed not only to want assassination, but to make the monarchy strangle itself, letting fear blossom within the system.\n\nInterrogation progress was equally disheartening. Two suspicious couriers were caught, their envelopes containing only blank paper. Tracing led to a wax seal workshop, but the owner had 'accidentally' drowned the day of the incident. Investigating the bitten wax seal fragment pointed to three different territorial document formats—absurd as mockery. Each approach to truth felt like stepping on a loose floor tile; beneath lay not a passage, but a carefully dug trap.\n\nWorse, subtle cracks appeared within the palace. Some nobles spoke sharply in councils, often demanding greater autonomy in the name of 'security'. Some regional lords sent condolence letters overly eager, as if confirming whether we were overly frightened. Others, with 'loyal advice', hinted that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should reduce public appearances, delegating more authority to 'trusted local figures'. Words sounded considerate, yet behind them like slowly tightening screws: if the throne were forced back, those holding military and tax power would grow taller in the shadows.\n\nCase files piled higher, leads grew colder. We could be certain this was no simple criminal murder: too professional, too restrained, too adept at creating fear and division. Yet before evidence was peeled away layer by layer, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could only hear the same phrase echoing: if the palace is not absolutely safe, then where in this land is safe?"

EDG_BAV_event.160.t: "Truth Unveiled"
EDG_BAV_event.160.d: "The turning point came in a seemingly insignificant detail: the imprint pattern on the wax seal fragment. Initially discarded as useless in a corner of the evidence box—fragmentary, blurred, tainted with poison and blood. Yet when our forensic examiner repeatedly compared it under candlelight, a deliberately shallow line from a coat of arms finally emerged: not a complete family crest, but a decorative border common on certain fief lord documents. The conspirators thought they erased key traces, forgetting 'habits' leave marks.\n\nSubsequent pursuit was like drawing back a curtain. We found the same ink used in palace roster alterations; from the ink merchant, tracked an anomalous purchase batch; following ledgers, discovered multiple 'donations' from different territories flowing into the same covert intermediary account. Dispersed, spaced, modest amounts, seemingly avoiding notice, yet combined sufficient to fund a trained covert network. More crucially, these accounts uniformly changed bookkeeping methods the same week, as if an order was issued: from now on, all traces must 'look like accidents'.\n\nWhen we raided the intermediary's residence, we found not gold but a hidden chamber. Walls held not weapons, but lists bearing names: court attendants, guard officers, scribes, city shopkeepers, even several nobles often loudly proclaiming loyalty in council halls. Beside names were symbols and numbers—debts, leverage, relatives' whereabouts, habitual routines, exploitable fears. Not an 'assassination plan', but a 'catalog of the state's weaknesses'.\n\nEven more chilling were letters in the chamber: numerous secret missives from different German territories, varied tones yet sharing the same cold, hard logic—they were no longer content with nominal submission and fiefs; they sought to redraw power boundaries; they believed the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s centralization, reforms, and armament threatened their traditional privileges; they viewed the palace blade as a probe, subsequent investigation as attrition, fear as a weapon. They were not gambling alone, but a group in tacit agreement: once the throne shook, local bolts would simultaneously drop.\n\nThus, all 'coincidences' linked into inevitability. The assassin was but a thrown stone; the real aim was to stir ripples—mutual suspicion among loyalties, administrative paralysis, military distraction, rampant public rumors—ultimately forcing [Root.Monarch.GetName] to compromise in isolation or fall in chaos. The so-called 'criminal case' was merely their meticulously laid mask; tearing it away revealed a web of conspiracy spanning states.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood by the council hall window, gazing at countless rooftops undulating in winter mist. Beneath those roofs were craftsmen, merchants, soldiers, families—they needed not court suspicion, but a state maintaining order, ensuring tomorrow. Yet the conspirators chose precisely the cruelest way: turning politics into assassination, disagreement into butcher's blade, pushing negotiable conflicts among German states toward bloody settlement.\n\nNow, truth was no longer a report to be locked in a filing cabinet, but an urgent command: either we strike first, settling accounts with those fief lords and their cohorts who tore off masks; or wait for them to simultaneously light torches in the night, plunging every city, road, and garrison into a vortex of betrayal and counter-betrayal.\n\nThis is a conspiracy, one targeting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally, and also targeting the nation's future. Disaster comes not from afar, but sprouts fangs from the power we ourselves enfeoffed—and once the first blood falls, what follows will be no longer interrogation and search, but the night destined for history books: Bloody Night."
EDG_BAV_event.160.a: "This is a conspiracy, one targeting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally!"
EDG_BAV_event.160.a_tt: "§RThe truth is clear; our enfeoffed German lords have torn off their masks. Disaster is imminent.§!\n\nEnable the disaster '§RBloody Night§!'.\n\nOnly after the disaster ends can we form @GER§YGermany§!."

EDG_BAV_event.161.t: "Lombardy Appeals to Us for Aid"
EDG_BAV_event.161.d: "The messenger arrived in twilight. His boots were caked with Lombardy plain mud, his cloak stitched with tears from forced marches, even the barely discernible Milanese emblem on his chest was darkened with sweat and dust. He did not wait for the herald to finish reading his purpose, but presented a scroll of documents with undried wax seal with both hands—the wax still warm, like an unset wound.\n\nThe document came from Lombardy's regency council, yet the signatures were chaotically near-ludicrous: nobles' long names, guild leaders' marks, even the rough imprint of the city defense commander's sword pommel. Between the lines, only one theme: appeal for aid.\n\nThey wrote that order within the city had been torn to shreds. Old Visconti officials and new elites distrusted each other; military pay ceased; mercenaries extracted ransoms between districts in the name of 'protection'; grain prices multiplied within weeks; suburban farmsteads were plundered; refugee crowds surged toward city gates only to be barred. Most critically, external forces were mustering under the pretext of 'maintaining Lombardy's stability': some assembled troops on borders, some spread rumors in ports, some bought off leaders in markets, awaiting the moment Milan collapsed from within.\n\nThey admitted inability to bear this storm alone. Every council within the city felt like a standoff: some advocated fully ceding military and administrative power to us in exchange for grain order and military discipline; others preferred limited aid, fearing such aid would become shackles. They even bluntly expressed fear in the document—if we hesitate, Lombardy would be seized by others' 'helping hand'; if we intervene, Lombardy might still preserve dignity under the treaty's name.\n\nThe messenger added a final oral request: they had initiated the aid appeal procedure according to the Treaty of Milan's clauses, requesting we dispatch troops, officers, and provisions, promising post-war returns of tariffs, land rights, and political concessions. Yet that return sounded more like a wager: betting we are in time, betting Milan can still be reassembled into a governable shape.\n\nCandlelight flickered; ink on the document spread like tidewater. If we extend a hand, we pull Lombardy from its fall with treaty and prestige—but also step into a burning city, bearing for them external hostility, internal turmoil, and endless future demands. If we withdraw, the treaty becomes empty talk; Lombardy will be reorganized under another's banner, and our promises will be revalued among princes and trade routes.\n\nLombardy cries to us for aid, yet also tests us: are we guardians who keep treaties, or bystanders who discuss responsibility only when safe?"
EDG_BAV_event.161.a: "Protect Lombardy!"
EDG_BAV_event.161.b: "This has nothing to do with us."

EDG_BAV_event.162.t: "Contact with the Mamluks?"
EDG_BAV_event.162.d: "The fertile soil and granaries of the Nile bring Cairo unending waves of wheat and merchants; while towns along the Isar and Danube sustain Bavaria's daily life with beer's aroma and craftsmanship. Now, Mamluk envoys extend goodwill, willing to exchange grain and ports for our gold, silver, and artisanry. To ensure beer flows long in every tavern, we cannot rely solely on neighbors' harvests. Perhaps it is time to cross deserts and sea winds, forging a stronger bond between Bavaria's cup and the East's bounty."
EDG_BAV_event.162.a: "Send a diplomatic request to the Mamluks."
EDG_BAV_event.162.a_tt: "If @MAM§Ythe Mamluks§! §Gagree§!, as long as we maintain an alliance with them, trade relations between both sides will significantly improve."
EDG_BAV_event.162.b: "This is unnecessary."

EDG_BAV_event.163.t: "[From.GetName]-[Root.GetName] Relations"
EDG_BAV_event.163.d: ""
EDG_BAV_event.163.a: "Their demand for grain is exceptionally strong; this will promote trade between both sides."
EDG_BAV_event.163.a_tt: "As long as both sides maintain an §Yalliance§! relationship, we and they will both gain §G+10.0%§! §Ygoods produced modifier§! and §G+20.0%§! §Ytrade efficiency§!."
EDG_BAV_event.163.b: "This is unnecessary."

EDG_BAV_event.165.t: "Merchants' Support"
EDG_BAV_event.165.d: "When vassals' banners rose across lands and oaths were torn to shreds, Munich's gates did not fall silent. At long tables of guilds and associations, the clink of gold outweighed rebel war drums: they were willing to advance military supplies for the palace, mend broken supply lines, in exchange for order's return and market peace. As long as goods and wealth still circulate, Bavaria's heart will not cease beating."
EDG_BAV_event.165.a: "We sincerely thank them for their support."

EDG_BAV_event.166.t: "Artists' Support"
EDG_BAV_event.166.d: "Under enveloping war smoke, some still refused to let Bavaria's soul dim alongside. Poets, painters, and musicians gathered between court and streets, forging invisible walls for us with song and art—they sang of loyalty, mocked rebellion, preventing fear from taking root in the people's hearts. If swords guard territory, then art guards the reason we fight."
EDG_BAV_event.166.a: "We sincerely thank them for their support."

EDG_BAV_event.167.t: "Clergy's Support"
EDG_BAV_event.167.d: "At the moment rebellion tore feudal bonds, voices from pulpits reached hearts more than any military order. Bishops and priests declared: oaths were not trivial, betrayal not without cost. They opened church granaries and alms, comforted the displaced, gathered believers in prayer and aid, clothing the palace's cause in sacred legitimacy. If faith remains, Bavaria still holds possibility for unity."
EDG_BAV_event.167.a: "We sincerely thank them for their support."

EDG_BAV_event.168.t: "Nobles' Support"
EDG_BAV_event.168.d: "Not all sword-bearers turned their backs on the throne. Those nobles still remembering ancestral oaths and kingdom boundaries came to Munich with retainers and banners: they bound themselves by blood and honor, willing to stand or fall with the palace in crisis. Today they stake family reputation; tomorrow, what we must defend is the dignity of a principality not dismembered."
EDG_BAV_event.168.a: "We sincerely thank them for their support."

EDG_BAV_event.169.t: "The Unexpected"
EDG_BAV_event.169.d: "Our Persian holdings recently discovered a refugee in Amol who claims descent from the Sassanian dynasty. He says he returned from Timurid lands, only to find his homeland devastated, and he has now come to Munich seeking employment in exchange for room and board. His words are earnest, his demeanor proper, and he seems harmless. Perhaps we could employ him as an advisor, leveraging his knowledge and experience to aid our Persian territories."
EDG_BAV_event.169.a: "Appoint him as our advisor"
EDG_BAV_event.169.b: "It is not necessary"
