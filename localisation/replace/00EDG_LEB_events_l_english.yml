EDG_flavorLEB_mission.1.t:0 "Preventing the Restoration"
EDG_flavorLEB_mission.1.d:0 "After the loss of control by the Sahada Dynasty in the Egyptian region, this ancient land fell into a state of chaos and conflict. Warlords rose up everywhere, attempting to seize a share in this power vacuum. Connections between cities and the countryside were severed, trade routes were cut off, farmland lay fallow, and the common people were displaced. The former prosperity and order vanished without a trace, replaced by endless conflict and turmoil.\n\nThe shadow of the Mamluk Sultanate never truly dissipated. Their military traditions, slave soldier system, and thirst for power meant their supporters still operated in the shadows, awaiting an opportunity to make a comeback. Should they resolve their conflicts and regain control of Egypt, the republican system we painstakingly built would be ruthlessly destroyed.\n\nThe fate of Egypt is tied to the future of the entire region. If we cannot consolidate the achievements of the republic here, the shadow of the Mamluks will once again loom over this land, and the people will be plunged back into suffering. We must act swiftly with firm resolve and wisdom to restore order and prosperity to Egypt, ensuring the ideals of the republic take root and flourish here. This is not only a promise to the people but also a responsibility for the future of the Republic."

EDG_flavorLEB_mission.2.t:0 "Syrian Alliance"
EDG_flavorLEB_mission.2.d:0 "The Republic practices the last will of the Ibadis. The Ghazi Warriors of Damascus are pious fanatics, while the Fadl tribe merely seeks to escape the terrifying vortex of Sahada's collapse. Though the three are distinct, we must cooperate—the rising Turkic power in the north is formidable, and the Mamluk regime in the south poses another major threat; their ambition will not let them relinquish this fertile land. The sea, the desert, and powerful forces press in on us step by step. The three Syrian states should continue their cooperation to confront the enemies at our gates."

EDG_flavorLEB_mission.3.d:0 "Years of cooperation have drawn the three Syrian states increasingly closer. The warriors of Damascus have come to accept Lebanon's concept of the Caliphate, and the Fadl tribe has directly benefited from Lebanon's maritime trade. Barriers between us have dissolved, but what of faith?"

EDG_flavorLEB_mission.5.d:0 "The brave warriors of the Republic have ended the turmoil in Egypt. Numerous refugees have been able to return to their homeland, the threat from the south has been contained, and we have entered a period of relative peace.\n\nHowever, the consequences of overexpansion are evident. Although the Republic's takeover had the support of the Egyptian refugees, unfamiliar territory and powerful local factions have greatly troubled the Republic's officials. Despite this, the withered order has chosen to sprout anew in this land.\n\nThe day the Republic's first heavy warship was launched is considered the founding day of the Alliance—the greatest masterpiece since the passing of Islam's Golden Age. Egyptian craftsmen built and completed her, while Lebanon's cedars made her impregnable. All who passed by could see the striking flag upon the great ship—a deep blue field symbolizing the Mediterranean Sea, and a silver crescent representing our will. Countless difficulties cannot stop us; the people standing shoulder to shoulder will revitalize this alliance state, framed by Sharia law. As stated in the Crescent Charter:\n\n«Under the Crescent, All Are Brothers!»"

EDG_flavorLEB_mission.6.d:0 "The Turkmen people of the north, hailing from the steppe tradition, possess an unparalleled understanding of the art of cavalry warfare. But for us, this has often meant pillage and slaughter. Now, having lost our suzerain, we must be even more vigilant against them.

The increasingly decaying Sahada can no longer offer the Republic protection, yet the people of the Republic are expected to go through fire and water for the Sahada tyrants.\n\nThose days are over. Now, Sahada is too preoccupied to meddle in our affairs. The Ghazi Warriors of Damascus and the Fadh tribe will join our cause. The tax collectors and conscription officers coming to Syria are destined to leave empty-handed today."

EDG_flavorLEB_mission.9.d:0 "The price of freedom is always steep, always requiring countless wars and sacrifices to obtain. The Mamluk selection system is undoubtedly brutal—only tall, robust enslaved boys can become elite Mamluk warriors, yet these warriors in turn enslave their own countrymen. Human desire is like a boulder rolling down a mountain; once it starts, it can never be stopped.\n\nSlaves here often dream of becoming elite Mamluks to rise above their station, trapped in a vortex of self-enslavement, yet fewer than one in ten live to see that day. We cannot send them back to their homelands, but we can end the evil of this system. At least within the Republic, these foreigners are free."

EDG_LEB_flavor_event.1.d:0 "On a tranquil night, Muhammad al-Hariri launched a coup, imprisoned the tyrant Ibrahim, and founded the Republic of Lebanon. Under his leadership, he stabilized the domestic situation and secured autonomous status for Lebanon from the Sahada Dynasty. This was our difficult beginning.\n\nMuhammad al-Hariri brought republican ideals here from Catalonia, granting citizenship to adult Lebanese men of property. A vast number of peasants and artisans gained political power for the first time. This attracted many scholars from the出走派 (Exodus faction) to exchange ideas, making Lebanon the academic center of the Ibadis. Through the sustained efforts of these出走派 scholars, within just a few years, Ibadism became the mainstream school of Islamic jurisprudence in Lebanon.\n\nMuhammad is no longer young. Lebanon's future is destined to be precarious. Even if the Republic can handle internal conflicts, the rising Turkic power in the north and the Egyptian regime in the south poised to supplant the Sahada Dynasty will not allow Lebanon to remain independent for long. But before the Republic falls, its light will shine equally and gently upon all."

EDG_LEB_flavor_event.6.t:0 "Arabic Calligraphy"
EDG_LEB_flavor_event.6.d:0 "The formation of Arabic calligraphy underwent a long historical process. Initially, various tribes on the Arabian Peninsula had their own distinct dialects, and a unified Arabic script had not yet taken shape. By the early 4th century, Arabs, building upon these diverse dialects, adopted the Nabataean script to enrich and refine their new writing system. During the Jahiliyyah period, poets would bring their artistically inscribed poems, such as the 'Mu'allaqat,' to marketplaces for dissemination, thereby advancing the art of calligraphy.\n\nAt that time, Arabic calligraphy was divided into two main styles: northern and southern. The northern style, associated with regions like Tadmor and the Hawran mountains, was characterized by smooth, elegant, and flowing forms. It was primarily used for quick notation and was historically known as the soft, cursive, or interlacing script. The southern style, prevalent in areas like Yemen, featured angular, robust, bold, and stable forms. It was mainly used for recording and compiling significant events and was historically known as the hard, Himyaritic, or angular script, considered the orthodox style of Arabic writing."

The church formally took shape in the 7th century, with John Maron as its first Patriarch. This denomination holds significant influence within the Republic, and Maronite Christians have made indelible contributions to the Republic's founding.\n\nAs the Republic steps into a new era of prosperity, Maronite Christians have become essential intermediaries for communication with Europe. Their extensive engagement in exchange and cooperation has endowed most of them with considerable learning and literary talent."

EDG_LEB_flavor_event.8.t:0 "Golden Age Manuscripts"
EDG_LEB_flavor_event.8.d:0 "The Islamic world during its Golden Age was a cultural melting pot, gathering, synthesizing, and elevating the knowledge of ancient civilizations from Mesopotamia, Rome, China, India, Persia, Egypt, North Africa, and Greece. The Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and the Umayyad Caliphate in Al-Andalus were major centers of intellectual scholarship at the time, with Cairo and Córdoba being rivals to Baghdad. Unfortunately, with the decline of the Islamic world, some knowledge from that Golden Age has long been lost.\n\nRecently, a batch of precious manuscripts inherited from the Islamic Golden Age was discovered in the market. We will transport these manuscripts to the library; our scholars will appreciate them."

EDG_LEB_flavor_event.9.t:0 "Desert Steeds"
EDG_LEB_flavor_event.9.d:0 "The Arabian horse is an excellent warhorse. A fully armed Bedouin warrior could often defeat enemies and win spoils such as flocks and camels for the tribe. Such battles demanded surprise attacks and swift, clean escapes. Arabian mares do not whinny when approaching enemy horses, thus not revealing their position. They charge fearlessly into battle, possessing both swift speed and enduring stamina, making them the preferred choice for warhorses.\n\nThe Bedouins dedicated themselves to maintaining the pure bloodline of these desert steeds, cultivating exceptional traits and quality. Mares were the most prized possession of the Bedouins, and the harsh desert environment allowed only the strongest horses to survive. These factors collectively shaped the characteristics of the Arabian horse we see today.\n\nThe Republic's development allows excellent horse breeders to have more extensive stables on our land. Despite the arid, hot climate and poor pasture growth, our horses will not let us down."

The Phoenicians extracted this purple dye by exposing and soaking murex snails, producing a color that was intense, long-lasting, and possessed a unique sheen. The production of Tyrian Purple was a malodorous affair; the vats used for collecting and processing the dye were placed on the city's outskirts to spare residents from the pungent smell. In fact, this odor would permeate the fabrics dyed with it, so that those few permitted to wear this color might leave a trail of fishy or garlicky scent as they passed.\n\nThis craft has not been lost to time, but we did not expect this purple dye to remain so popular in Europe."
