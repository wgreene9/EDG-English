EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_1_title:0 "Suppress the Rebellion"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_1_desc:0 "Bogomilists have incited a revolt in the upper reaches of the Oka River. We must suppress it and reclaim the territory that belongs to Ryazan."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_3_title:0 "Recover Chernigov"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_3_desc:0 "The Rurik dynasty of the Principality of Chernigov has died out. The current rulers of Chernigov are not Rurikids but usurpers. As kin of the Chernigov Ruriks, we Ryazanians have the duty to inherit and rule Chernigov!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_4_title:0 "Cross the Dnieper River"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_4_desc:0 "The Dnieper River was the lifeline of ancient Rus', connecting the Varangian trade route and enabling the establishment and rise of ancient Rus'. But today we must cross this Dnieper River and unify the Rus' on both banks."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_5_title:0 "Advance on Kiev"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_1_5_desc:0 "Kiev, ancient and sacred. She is the source of legitimacy for all Rus' princes and the pearl upon the Dnieper. Ryazan must control Kiev to proclaim our supremacy over Rus'."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_2_title:0 "Intervene in Rus' Civil War" # Intervene in the Rus' Civil War
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_2_desc:0 "Kiev has lost control over Rus'. We should also find a suitable way to intervene in this war."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_3_title:0 "Defend Ryazan"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_3_desc:0 "Facing the northeastern Rus'—the Principality of Vladimir and its various successors—Ryazan appears weak and outnumbered. We have thus lost many territories. But now the northeastern Rus' is mired in civil war; this is a heaven-sent opportunity to reclaim our lost lands!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_4_title:0 "Standing Streltsy"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_4_desc:0 "The druzhina are precious, and as the Ryazan state expands, they can no longer meet the growing demands of war. Therefore, Ryazan needs to form a new standing force. They must undergo strict, genuine military training, be detached from production, and receive wages from the prince."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_6_title:0 "Reign Over Rus'"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_2_6_desc:0 "With Kiev in our hands and Vladimir without a successor, only the Prince of Ryazan remains the true monarch of Rus' upon this land."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_1_title:0 "Feodor's Reforms"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_1_desc:0 "Although princely authority in Ryazan is highly centralized, without granting corresponding benefits to the nobility, they will not willingly serve the crown. Ceding rights to the nobility is Ryazan's first step, but certainly not the last. Forward is the only path; Ryazan has no retreat!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_2_title:0 "Military Reforms" # Ryazan Military Reforms
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_2_desc:0 "With Tatar nobles and military forces introduced into Ryazan, the new army of Ryazan requires time to adapt and integrate. But this time is necessary, as a combined-arms force of infantry and cavalry will hold an advantage over other armies in war."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_3_title:0 "The Military Nobility" # Rise of the Military Nobility
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_3_desc:0 "Our military strength grows daily. It is time to promote a new generation of military nobles to end the long-standing discord between Tatar and Rus' nobility."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_4_title:0 "Cross the Moskva"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_4_desc:0 "The Moskva River is a tributary of the Oka. Muscovites can always sail downstream to attack Ryazan. To ensure Ryazan's security, Moscow must be under our control!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_5_title:0 "The Fall of Tver"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_3_5_desc:0 "Over the past two centuries, Tver may have been the most powerful state in northeastern Rus'. But they will no longer be powerful, because Ryazan shall rule Tver's lands, and Ryazan shall rule the Tverians."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_2_title:0 "The Status of Kasimov"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_2_desc:0 "Since the death of the Khan of the Kasimov tribe—or rather, Prince Kasim—the Prince of Ryazan has concurrently served as Khan of the Kasimov tribe. Now that we have incorporated Tatar nobles into the Ryazan court, the Kasimov territory should naturally be fully integrated into Ryazan."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_4_title:0 "Occupy Sarai"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_4_desc:0 "Sarai, this city that once rode high and mighty over us, is now beneath our feet, kneeling and begging for mercy. The former Tatar shackles—now we shall return them in full! Their lands, their people, their blood!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_5_title:0 "Tame the Steppe"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_5_desc:0 "Some say the steppe is always unruly, but that is not true. If you whip them hard enough, you will find that nomads are not so different from farmers."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_6_title:0 "Khan of the Great Steppe"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_4_6_desc:0 "No one claims to be Khan of the Golden Horde anymore. Now the steppe kneels at the feet of the Ryazan prince. We shall declare that the Prince of Ryazan is the new khan of the entire great steppe, and the Rurik dynasty shall replace the Golden Family!"

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_1_title:0 "Ryazan Estate System" # Expand the Ryazan Estate System
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_1_desc:0 "Is it the massive increase in agricultural output that supported the expansion of the Grand Principality of Ryazan, or did the expansion of the Grand Principality of Ryazan lead to the massive increase in agricultural output? This is a chicken-or-egg question."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_3_title:0 "Steppe Trade Regulations"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_3_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Rus' opened trade routes to the Caspian Sea, exchanging goods with the peoples of the great steppe. Now we should restore this ancient trade link."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_4_title:0 "Tatar Boyars"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_4_desc:0 "Boyars always boast of their ancient lineage and the territories they control. Now they should know that ancestral heritage is not the reason they are boyars; the prince's favor is."

EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_5_title:0 "Ryazan Light Cavalry"
EDG_BELA_RYA_A_5_5_desc:0 "Combining traditional Mongol tactics and organization with new firearms and fine weapons and armor, the cavalry of Ryazan shall become the sharpest spear on the battlefield!"
