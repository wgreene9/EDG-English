EDG_LEB_1_7_title:0 "To the Blessed Land of Arabia"
EDG_LEB_1_7_desc:0 "Let us march south, reclaim the Holy Sites, and conquer and unify the warring tribes of Yemen. 'The Blessed Land of Arabia,' Yemen—a populous and fertile Arab region—has long been rife with conflict. This makes them an easy target on our path to unify the peninsula once and for all."

EDG_LEB_1_9_title:0 "Integrating the Maghreb"
EDG_LEB_1_9_desc:0 "The name 'Maghreb' comes from Arabic, literally meaning 'the West.' Traditionally, it refers to much of North and Northwest Africa, a region currently embroiled in the chaos of Crusader and heretic conflicts. Let us bring them under the Republic's rule and advance onward to Al-Andalus."

EDG_LEB_1_11_title:0 "Emirate of Sicily"
EDG_LEB_1_11_desc:0 "The island of Sicily in the Mediterranean was once continuously controlled by Arab forces for centuries. Later, the island was reconquered by Christians, but it remains a crucial stepping stone for the conquest of Italy. Our navy can launch raids on the Italian coast from Sicily and ultimately threaten Rome—the heart of Western Christianity."

EDG_LEB_2_4_desc:0 "Conquering Jerusalem is an essential step to bolster the influence of the Ibadis. Since its conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate's armies in 637, the city has endured much turmoil and been the target of many infidel Crusades. Today, the city is back in our hands."

EDG_LEB_2_5_title:0 "Fate of the Sunni Caliph" # The Fate of the Sunni Caliph
EDG_LEB_2_5_desc:0 "The Muslim community should publicly elect its own leader; the chosen one need not necessarily be from the Quraysh tribe. Any devout believer who can uphold justice and possesses recognized competence is qualified to be elected as leader. Once a leader fails to uphold justice, loses the people's support, or personally deviates from the righteous path and commits injustices, they can be removed by the Muslims, or even legally held accountable through military action if necessary. Now, it is for us to decide the fate of this leader."

EDG_LEB_2_10_desc:0 "Al-Andalus was once a vital part of the Islamic world, home to many scholars and philosophers, and the birthplace of our republican ideals.

EDG_LEB_2_11_title:0 "Revenge on the Crusaders" # Revenge Against the Crusaders
EDG_LEB_2_11_desc:0 "The nine Crusades in history were undeniably acts of barbaric aggression. Tyrants plundered our lands in the name of faith. Today, the Caliph will once again follow the path of Muslim predecessors in their conquest of France. This time, the power of Allah will be supreme."

EDG_LEB_3_1_title:0 "Declaration of Independence"

EDG_LEB_3_8_title:0 "Unify the Homeland"
EDG_LEB_3_8_desc:0 "Since the era of the first Caliph, Arab tribes have never sworn allegiance to a single ruler; even then, they frequently rebelled, leading to civil wars within the Caliphate—the Fitnas. This will not happen under our rule. We will restore the era of Islamic unity."

EDG_LEB_3_9_title:0 "Tyrants Reap Their Due"
EDG_LEB_3_9_desc:0 "For centuries, the Islamic world has not seen a wise ruler like the first three Caliphs; the people have suffered endlessly under hardship.

EDG_LEB_3_10_title:0 "Zanzibar Trade"
EDG_LEB_3_10_desc:0 "Through Muslim merchants, the word of Allah has already reached the southeastern corner of Africa. That said, Islam in this region is only superficially based among the trading elites and remains weak. It is evident that the local Sultans and Chieftains are unwilling to spread the faith, so we must take matters into our own hands."

EDG_LEB_3_12_title:0 "The Rightly Guided"
EDG_LEB_3_12_desc:0 "Since the passing of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam has experienced several golden ages, yet only the four Rightly Guided Caliphs who succeeded the Prophet are universally recognized by the Islamic world. It has been a long time since any Islamic state could claim the piety and prestige that the Rashidun Caliphs possessed before the division of the Islamic world. Have our actions so far earned us the right to declare ourselves 'The Rightly Guided' among all other Muslims?"

EDG_LEB_4_6_title:0 "Cedars and Crescent"

Now, beneath these cedars and upon this fertile soil, a new Republic is rising, our blades as sharp as the crescent moon."

EDG_LEB_4_11_title:0 "Enter the Sulaimans" # Enter the Sulaiman Mountains
EDG_LEB_4_11_desc:0 "Though the Caliphate's influence once halted at the Sulaiman Mountains, the word of Allah has spread further, reaching Nusantara, India, and along the Silk Road. However, many in these regions tend to blend Islam with local beliefs, promoting false idolatry. We need to penetrate these societies."

EDG_LEB_5_9_title:0 "Enter the North"
EDG_LEB_5_9_desc:0 "Our lands in the Mashriq are defended only by a few local fortresses standing on open plains formed by river alluvium. We need to expand our buffer zones to deny our enemies any room for maneuver."

EDG_LEB_1_13_title:0 "Liberate the Mamluks"
EDG_LEB_1_13_desc:0 "Mamluks originally were slaves, most of them non-Muslim youths captured from the Caucasus and the northern Black Sea regions. Some were seized by slave traders and sold to the Middle East, then formed into mercenary armies by Caliphs and Sultans, while others came from certain eastern tribes who were selected by Caliphs and Sultans to serve as their mercenaries. We will put an end to the Mamluk system; no one should be a slave."

EDG_LEB_1_20_title:0 "Damascus Arsenal"
EDG_LEB_1_20_desc:0 "An arsenal is a place for manufacturing weapons and armor. In peacetime, it is used for repairing and storing armaments. Soldiers only carry weapons and armor when about to engage in close combat with the enemy. The first arsenals appeared alongside the first professional armies of Sumer and Akkad. Every standing army has its arsenal, which might be a simple yet heavily guarded warehouse or equipped only for producing firearms."

EDG_LEB_2_12_title:0 "Consolidate the Republic"
EDG_LEB_2_12_desc:0 "The Ibadi school emphasizes that a leader's duty is to remain loyal to Allah's commandments, implement Sharia law, uphold justice and fairness, resist enemies, and protect the faithful. All leaders, including the sect's Imams Jabir and Abdullah ibn Ibad, are equal to ordinary Muslims in terms of rights and obligations as defined by Sharia. This aligns perfectly with republicanism. Republicanism is the foundation of Lebanon's statehood; we must never allow Lebanon to fall into the hands of tyrants!"

EDG_LEB_2_18_desc:0 "The Bedouins dedicate themselves to maintaining the pure bloodline of their desert steeds, cultivating exceptional traits and quality. Mares are the most prized possession of the Bedouins, and the harsh desert environment allows only the strongest horses to survive. These factors collectively shape the characteristics of the Arabian horse we see today. 'Flight requires no wings; victory requires no sword.' These spirited horses symbolize our courage and freedom. Together with their iron hooves, we will shatter all shackles!"
EDG_LEB_mission_2_18_tt:0 "When we §Ymanually increase§! development in an Arabian or Bedouin-cultured province that produces livestock, there is a one-quarter chance to trigger the §O'Desert Steeds'§! event, which enhances our cavalry.
