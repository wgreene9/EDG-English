EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_12_title:0 "Governor of Aquitaine"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_12_desc:0 "The Duchy of Aquitaine is another powerful Cathar-aligned regime in Southern France, second only to the Kingdom of Arles. In dealing with a problem, one must see it through to the end. How can we allow others to snore beside our own bed? The threat of the Cathars must never again arise within our realm. The Duchy of Aquitaine must be destroyed, and the heretical foundations of its rule must be uprooted entirely."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_13_title:0 "The Crown of Lothair"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_13_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Lotharingia has weathered centuries of storms. Its lords have carved out their own domains, proclaiming themselves kings. Now, we place their crowns upon our own head. We are the master of Lotharingia and the master of Italy. Perhaps, one day, we shall be the master of all Europa."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_15_title:0 "Mediterranean Ambition"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_15_desc:0 "The Mediterranean is the center of European trade. Whether it be spices from Asia or gold, all must pass through the gates of the Mediterranean to flow continuously into Europe. As our naval strength grows ever stronger, we can attempt to expand our share of Mediterranean trade, seizing an extra portion of the feast."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_16_title:0 "Conquering the Sea"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_16_desc:0 "Tunis is one of the vital trading hubs of North Africa, arguably the most important in central North Africa. This small island, blessed with a natural harbor, serves as the primary trading entrepôt, gathering merchants and speculators of different religions, languages, and cultures. By controlling this place, we control the key artery of North African Mediterranean trade."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_17_title:0 "The Province of Africa"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_17_desc:0 "With our control over the regions surrounding Tunis and the Maghreb, the entirety of the African coast will fall into our hands. As we occupy the greater part of North Africa, our control over its trade can grow by orders of magnitude, while also striking fear into the hearts of the Muslim infidels."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_21_title:0 "The Brown-Booted Army"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_21_desc:0 "During the medieval period, the quality of our troops was uneven, and their equipment varied greatly in standard, severely hindering unified training and command. With the advancement of our modernization, our forces can now march in unified brown boots, with synchronized steps, heads held high and chests out, advancing proudly forward."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_23_title:0 "Magnani Reforms"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_1_23_desc:0 "Ricciotti Magnani was a key military reformer of the 19th-century Italian army. He reorganized the forces, reformed the military system into a territorial army, and introduced the concept of secondary-line troops. Under his leadership, the Italian army achieved true modernization, ultimately completing the great leap forward of the post-Napoleonic era."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_11_title:0 "Defeating Arles"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_11_desc:0 "The former court of the Cathar heretics in Arles has now been eradicated by us. The head of their usurper has been severed, mounted on a pike, and displayed to all the people of Arles. A mad era has passed. What we must do now is purge the stubborn heretical remnants and bring Occitania back onto the righteous path."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_12_title:0 "Seizing Paris"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_12_desc:0 "Paris has been the center of French rule ever since Hugh Capet, the first monarch of the Capetian dynasty, was crowned King of all the Franks here in 987. Now, armies from Italy occupy this city; we have formally plunged our dagger into the heart of the Franks. It will not be long before Francia is unified under the Italian banner."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_13_title:0 "The Province of Gaul"
EDG_TTS_mission_2_13_desc:0 "With our occupation of most of the Frankish territories, we can establish a province here, much like the Roman Empire that once spanned Europe, to better administer Francia. This will also serve our further expansion on the European continent."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_14_title:0 "The Province of Britannia"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_14_desc:0 "As our conquests advance, the entirety of Britannia is incorporated into our domain. This is an unprecedented achievement. Even at the height of the Roman Empire, Roman emperors could only build a wall in northern England to shamefully fend off barbarian incursions. We have surpassed them, establishing a province spanning the whole of Britannia."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_16_title:0 "Dominion"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_16_desc:0 "With the unification of Italy under our belt, it is time for us to prepare to restore the glory of Rome. Spain is the gateway to Western Europe, controlling trade between Europe and the Americas. We should establish our foothold in Valencia to lay the groundwork for the further conquest of Spain."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_18_title:0 "The Province of Hispania"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_18_desc:0 "The Spanish regions are gradually falling into our hands. The westernmost jewel on the crown of the Roman Empire has been recovered. Now, we can establish the Province of Hispania here, restoring the former rule of the Roman Empire and the order that Spain rightfully deserves."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_20_title:0 "Machiavellian Reforms"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_20_desc:0 "Machiavelli implemented a series of military reforms in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, effectively facilitating the transformation of the Italian army from feudal levies into a professional force. He successfully established an efficient military system for Italy, better serving the needs of war."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_21_title:0 "Gonzalo's Army"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_21_desc:0 "Although Gonzalo was a Spaniard, he participated in the Italian Wars of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. His military concepts profoundly influenced Italy. The Spanish Tercio he pioneered, composed of pikemen and musketeers, was meticulously emulated by the Italians and applied in warfare."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_22_title:0 "Francesco's Tactics"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_2_22_desc:0 "As the Italians comprehensively studied Spanish tactics, a renowned military leader, Francesco Pizzaro, came into their view. By imitating him, the Italians gained deeper insights into the coordinated operations of muskets and infantry, significantly enhancing their military combat capabilities."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_13_title:0 "Eagle of the World"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_13_desc:0 "How long has it been since the fall of the Roman Empire? So long that it feels like a name from legend. Only in a mother's bedside stories and the ruins of the collapsed aqueducts outside Rome do tales of the Roman Empire still linger. Now, we crown ourselves Emperor once more, just like the Roman Emperors of old. But this time, it is no longer just a story."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_15_title:0 "Rome Never Falls"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_15_desc:0 "We are like our ancestors. We crossed the Balkan Mountains, traversed the Peloponnese, and reached the heart of Greek civilization. We crossed the Alps, bringing the local people of the peninsula, regardless of religion, to kneel at our feet. At last, Rome is reborn, and Europa shall be united once again."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_16_title:0 "Holy Roman Emperor"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_16_desc:0 "After gaining control over all of Northern Italy, the Holy Roman Empire north of the Alps undoubtedly becomes our greatest threat. They constantly menace our northern frontier, while their prosperous southern territories are also highly tempting. We should consider using Italy's vast resources to challenge this false empire in war."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_17_title:0 "Controlling the Alps"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_17_desc:0 "With our conquest of the northernmost Alpine principality—the County of Tyrol—we have finally gained complete control over the Alps. Once we stabilize the local situation and establish regional governance, our armies will be ready to march into the open plains of Southern Germany."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_18_title:0 "Dismantling the Empire"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_18_desc:0 "This so-called, neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire—this illegitimate regime—has been ground to dust under the might of the Italian army. The false state that usurped the name of Rome exists no more. The true army of the Romans has accomplished a feat their ancestors never achieved—for the first time, setting foot on the lands of the Germanic peoples."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_19_title:0 "Germania Magna"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_19_desc:0 "With the full unification of the Germanic territories under our rule, we can proudly claim to be the masters of all Germania Magna. Times have changed. The Germanic peoples, who once roamed, hunted, and lived primitively, now live under feudal order. And the Romans, who once fell to the Germanic tribes, now stand upon Germanic soil."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_21_title:0 "The Education Movement"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_21_desc:0 "'The Education Movement was a 16th-century Italian initiative aimed at modernizing and improving local education. Under its banner, a series of comprehensive educational infrastructure projects were undertaken. Schools at various levels sprang up, and excellent teachers were recruited from across Europe. These measures made Italy one of the nations with the highest educational standards in Europe at the time.' — The Cambridge History of Italy, Volume V"

EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_23_title:0 "The Printing Press and National Modernization"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_3_23_desc:0 "The widespread application of the printing press has been a great boon to our nation's publishing industry. Hymnals, newspapers, and novels are being produced in an endless stream. Our nation's literature and arts have begun to flourish, with a variety of works emerging in abundance. Government efficiency has also multiplied several times over."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_11_title:0 "The Province of Thrace"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_11_desc:0 "With our reconquest of the areas surrounding the original capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, we have essentially gained full control of Thrace. We can, like the Romans of old, establish the Province of Thrace here. After more than a thousand years, the Romans have returned to their loyal Constantinople."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_12_title:0 "The Province of Asia"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_12_desc:0 "Asia Minor is situated at the crossroads of three continents, serving as the gateway to Asia and Africa. Controlling it opens the door for our advance into Asia and Africa. With our conquest of the Anatolian Turkish infidels, we should establish the Province of Asia here, once again instituting Roman-style rule."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_13_title:0 "The Province of Syria"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_13_desc:0 "Syria is located in the fertile region of the Two Rivers, rich in agricultural resources. Simultaneously, positioned at the junction of Asia and Africa, its strategic importance is paramount. We should establish the Province of Syria here, both for the convenience of economic development and for our strategic needs."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_14_title:0 "The Province of Aegyptus"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_14_desc:0 "'Aegyptus' is the ancient Roman name for Egypt, derived from a mythical Egyptian king of the same name in Greek mythology. With our complete occupation of Egypt, we can re-establish this province. After more than a thousand years, Egypt is once again brought under Roman rule."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_17_title:0 "Colonial Ambitions"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_17_desc:0 "Although Italy's geographical position is not ideal for colonization, as the wealth of the Americas steadily flows into the Iberian Peninsula and radiates across Europe, we too are filled with interest in its riches. We should strive to establish several colonies to meet our nation's demand for precious metals."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_19_title:0 "Colonial Empire"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_19_desc:0 "With the steady progress of our colonial enterprise, Italy has undoubtedly become a veritable colonial empire. Each day, countless goods depart from the east coast of North America, traveling eastward with the ocean currents towards the Apennine Peninsula. The prosperous trade routes declare the resounding success of our colonization."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_21_title:0 "Eagle of the Mediterranean"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_21_desc:0 "As our naval construction progresses steadily, ship after ship is launched. Now, the Italian navy can sail the Mediterranean unimpeded. Our maritime power radiates across the entire Mediterranean; our vessels can reach every trading post in the sea."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_22_title:0 "Taming the Seas"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_22_desc:0 "With the further growth of our navy, we can proudly proclaim that we have conquered the entire ocean. Now, traces of Italian ships are found on every sea. The navy can sail to all corners of the world. Fearless of raging waves, the four seas are now ours to command."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_24_title:0 "Public Culture"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_4_24_desc:0 "With the gradual advancement of Italy's cultural industry, we are progressively forming a complete public culture with distinct Italian characteristics. This culture represents our people; it truly unites our populace. Italians are connected by a shared cultural bond."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_12_title:0 "The Province of Illyricum and Pannonia"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_12_desc:0 "The Praetorian Prefecture of Illyricum and Pannonia was the institution through which the old Roman Empire exercised control over the Balkans, comprising two subordinate dioceses: the Diocese of Illyricum and the Diocese of Pannonia. With our complete control over the Balkans, we can re-establish this prefecture."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_13_title:0 "New Natural Frontiers"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_13_desc:0 "The semi-circular arc of the Carpathian Mountains naturally suits our defense against threats from the northeast. With our comprehensive conquest of the Balkans, we can adopt the Carpathians as our natural frontier, fully securing against the Polish threat from the northeast and solidifying Roman rule."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_16_title:0 "Terra Incognita"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_16_desc:0 "Our merchants were always perplexed, wondering how the Iberians continuously obtained what seemed like gold conjured from the void. Now, we too have discovered that place—the Americas. The bountiful Americas hold all the produce we could imagine and more."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_18_title:0 "Invading Ethiopia"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_18_desc:0 "Ethiopia, the realm of King Solomon. This is a vital transportation hub leading to Asia and the Red Sea. By controlling this region, our trade routes can extend directly to the eastern coast of Africa and western Asia. Through the invasion of Ethiopia, our trade can experience further growth."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_20_title:0 "Legacy of King Solomon"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_20_desc:0 "With our complete control over Ethiopia, we fully inherit the legacy of King Solomon. Now, all of East Africa lies within our sphere of influence. We truly wield substantial influence in West Asia and East Africa. This is what King Solomon, and not only he, has bestowed upon us."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_22_title:0 "Mediterranean Trade Hub"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_22_desc:0 "With our comprehensive control over Mediterranean trade, we have established a trade network spanning all of Europa and North Africa. The commerce of the Mediterranean is now entirely under our command. Countless Italian merchant ships arrive and depart from major ports across the sea each day, unloading and loading goods, a scene of thriving prosperity."

EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_23_title:0 "Our Sea"
EDG_TTS_2_mission_5_23_desc:0 "The Mediterranean, a place familiar to every Italian from childhood. Italians cannot be separated from the sea, just as fish cannot live without water. Now, whether for our material supply or military provisions, all stem from this vast trade network. Our Mediterranean, our mother."
