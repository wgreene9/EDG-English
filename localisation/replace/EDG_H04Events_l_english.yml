EDG_H04Events.0.name:0 "Viceroyalty of Frisia"
EDG_H04Events.0.desc:0 "The ancestry of the Gerulfingen family can be traced back to the semi-historical, semi-legendary first Frisian King, Radbod. The Gerulfingen family's rule in Holland lasted until the 13th century. When Willem II, Count of Holland and leader of the Gerulfingen family, inherited the claim of the anti-king Heinrich Raspe and was elected as an anti-king opposing the Hohenstaufen dynasty, this count from the imperial frontier could no longer remain aloof from the empire's storms. Naturally, the Hohenstaufen dynasty, incensed by this minor count daring to oppose them, secretly encouraged the Frisians to turn against this overambitious figure. Willem II himself died in battle during the suppression of this rebellion.\n\nHis son, Floris V, devoted his life to two pursuits: continuing his father's policy of opposing the empire, and asserting his claim to the Scottish throne. To uphold these principles, he allied with Edward I of England. Although this alliance nearly collapsed due to disputes over the Duchy of Guelders, it ultimately endured thanks to the long-standing, robust wool trade between the two nations. Supported from behind by the English king, the Count of Holland greatly expanded his influence in the Low Countries. The Hohenstaufen dynasty, mired in internal strife, was powerless to restrain the ambitions on its frontier; as long as this upstart harbored no designs on the imperial crown, all was deemed acceptable. After Floris V's death, the Low Countries were divided: the senior line inherited the exceedingly wealthy County of Holland, while the junior line was settled in the relatively poor IJssel delta, becoming the Counts of Overijssel.\n\nThe struggling Hohenstaufen dynasty ultimately failed to pass their imperial crown down through the generations. The rising powers of the Luxembourg and Wittelsbach dynasties eyed the empire covetously. Following the 1260 ruling of the Imperial Diet, announced by the conveners—the newly appointed Prince-Elector, the Archbishop of Münster, and the Archbishop of Mainz—Franconia was to be inherited by the descendants of Conrad, son of Henry IV, as neither great house wished to see the other swallow such a vast inheritance. For similar reasons, when the main line of the Gerulfingen family died out in 1341 and the Bavarians, using their inheritance rights, cast greedy eyes upon Holland, Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg, then on the imperial throne, immediately backed the junior line. This conflict became known as the 'War of the Holland Succession.' However, to the great misfortune of both the emperor and the Gerulfingen family, they were utterly routed by the Bavarians at the Battle of Ingolstadt, and the wealthy Holland was lost to them.\n\nAs compensation for the defeated side—and more importantly, to check the greatest rival extending its influence into the Low Countries—the emperor transferred the title of 'Viceroy of Frisia' and the administrative authority over the Prince-Bishopric of Münster entirely to Overijssel. Losing a prince-bishopric was a more acceptable outcome than forfeiting his dominant position within the empire. Along with Münster, the electoral powers granted to it in 1260 were also transferred. However, times had changed. With the Bavarian lands split into three, Overijssel, once created as a counterbalance, had become an unwieldy problem for the empire.\n\nNow, two paths lie before Overijssel. One leads to the sea, beyond the blue waves of the North Sea, to lands beyond those of the Britons, to legends of lands rich with grapes—the legacy of Floris V. The other leads into the empire, much like their ancestor Willem II. In times of imperial turmoil, only the bold can stand firm."

EDG_H04Events.1.name:0 "War of the Holland Succession"
EDG_H04Events.1.desc:0 "The County of Holland was the most significant title previously held by the Gerulfingen family. However, after the death of Floris V, rule over the Low Countries was divided: the senior line inherited the wealthy County of Holland, while the junior line inherited the relatively poor IJssel delta to the west, becoming the Counts of Overijssel.\n\nIn 1341, the senior line of the Gerulfingen family suddenly died out. The last Count of Holland had no sons, and his only daughter was betrothed to the second son of the Duke of Upper Bavaria. The Bavarians, of course, would not pass up this opportunity to inherit the entirety, immediately declaring themselves the sole heirs to the County of Holland. However, the senior and junior lines of the Gerulfingen family had maintained several generations of intermarriage, resulting in at least two Counts of Holland being 'born unfit to rule.' The junior line would naturally not stand by while outsiders interfered with the family's lands, and thus both sides soon took up arms.\n\nFacing the aggressive advance of the House of Wittelsbach, the then Emperor Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg immediately sided against Bavaria. However, their combined forces, marching arrogantly forward, were ambushed and decisively defeated at the Battle of Ingolstadt. This imperial defeat at the hands of a prince severely undermined the authority of the Luxembourg dynasty and the entire imperial court. Yet, due to the great distance between the Low Countries and the highlands of Bavaria, a compromise was reached: the richest parts of the County of Holland were ceded to the victors, while the other territories would go their own way.\n\nThereafter, the Gerulfingen family diligently managed the IJssel delta, actively participating in imperial affairs while never forgetting their claim to the County of Holland. When the Bavarian lands split into three, leading to the independence of the County of Holland, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew the time had come to reclaim their ancestral lands."

Therefore, the title 'Overijssel' no longer suffices for the current needs of governance. To better legitimize claims over the Low Countries, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has merged the County of Holland with the County of the Overijssel Delta, unifying them under the name 'IJssel'.\n\nFollowing the recovery of their ancestral lands, the relocation of the capital was soon brought to the agenda. Some family members propose moving the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and administrative center back to the prosperous [4383.GetName] to assert our indisputable sovereignty over the Low Countries. Others, however, suggest retaining the current capital, arguing it would maintain closer ties with the Prince-Bishopric of Münster and surrounding principalities.\n\nRegardless of where the capital is moved, [Root.GetName] is finally reunited. Affairs both within and beyond the Empire will become the foremost focus of the Gerulfingen family."

EDG_H04Events.4.desc:0 "Although East Frisia appears to fall under the jurisdiction of [Root.GetName], it has been administratively attached to the County of Holland since the reign of Floris V. Following his death, the region passed to the senior line of the Gerulfingen family and was subsequently lost along with Holland during the War of the Holland Succession, coming under the control of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nHowever, due to its geographical status as an exclave of the County of Holland, which made governance difficult, East Frisia was re-established as a separate county and granted as a fief. In 1381, Count Okko II of East Frisia proved to be a disastrous ruler, plunging the local peasantry into severe hardship. That same year, with the support of the Gerulfingen family, the peasants of East Frisia overthrew their count and declared independence.\n\nUpon hearing news of the independence, the House of Wittelsbach quickly prepared to dispatch troops to suppress the region. Yet, mired in their own internal conflicts and facing persistent obstruction from the Gerulfingen family, they were ultimately forced to abandon the attempt to quell the revolt.\n\nEast Frisia formally declared independence in 1382 and attempted to establish a peasant republic. However, the emperor never recognized this independence, meaning the entity remained, in essence, a rebel faction. Considering their own sphere of influence and future plans for integration, [Root.GetName] guaranteed East Frisia's independence that same year. The two parties have maintained good relations ever since, with the Gerulfingen family waiting for the opportune moment to incorporate East Frisia into [Root.GetName].\n\nAs East Frisia's dependence on [Root.GetName] has grown ever deeper, it has become a de facto vassal state. We can now swiftly integrate it directly into [Root.GetName], or adopt a more gradual and moderate approach."

EDG_H04Events.9.name:0 "The Problema of the Euchites"
EDG_H04Events.9.desc:0 "The Euchites are a sect that emerged around 370 AD, mentioned by the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople. Their leader, reportedly named Peter and claiming to be Christ, was sentenced to stoning for blasphemy. Before his execution, he told his followers that three days later, he would ascend to heaven in the form of a wolf from his tomb.\n\nThe core doctrine of the Euchites reflects a unique form of materialism. They assert that the Trinity is perceived through carnal senses, that God transformed Himself into matter to unite with the perfect spirit, and that God manifests His existence through different perceptions. They believe the perfect human form is achieved through prayer alone, not sacraments. According to some studies, this may derive from the libertine ideas of certain early Gnostic sects.\n\nThe Euchites engage in orgies and even acts contrary to moral norms. Their influence has spread to various regions and they have had contact with the Bogomils, the Bosnian Church, the Pataria movement, and the Cathars. The spread of the Black Death led to a sharp decline in Europe's population, and the teachings of the Euchites seemed to fill this void. Meanwhile, the failures of the two Albigensian Crusades caused both the upper and lower classes in some areas to question the authority of the Catholic Church more deeply. The Euchites, whose doctrines share many similarities with Catharism, thus began to spread gradually. Both lower-class Catholic believers under great pressure and the upper classes indulging in hedonism favored this doctrine that liberated human nature. Consequently, the Euchites spread like wildfire in northern Germany. Although no prince dares to openly profess this faith under Catholic pressure, it has become a 'secret belief' commonly held by various classes both inside and outside the Empire.\n\nThe primary area of operation for [Root.GetName] is the Low Countries, where the spread of the Euchites has been minimal. However, since inheriting the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, the Euchites in the Westphalia region have begun to slowly infiltrate the Low Countries. Although the scale is not large, it cannot be left unchecked. Due to the nature of Euchite doctrine, its spread does not threaten ruling authority; in fact, promoting its teachings could stabilize rule. However, openly professing this faith would certainly affect our relations with other princes, and the throne of the Holy Roman Empire would become even more distant. Therefore, while openly converting to the Euchite faith might consolidate our rule, external pressure cannot be underestimated. Perhaps maintaining the current religious unity would be a better choice."

An alliance was formed with princes, great and small, who share similar or differing goals but have converging interests, demanding an end to the persecution of non-Catholics within the Empire.\n\nAlthough ostensibly a religious conflict, in reality, all neighboring powers seek to profit from this war.

The other faction calls themselves the Reformers, arguing that the expression of bodily pleasure should not be confined to traditional conventions. Any method that brings the most primal desires to the body is a pursuit of the human form's most perfect state, and the more 'unique' the method, the more devout the expression of faith.\n\nAlthough the Pure currently hold a majority among the faithful, the Reformers' following has been steadily increasing in recent years.

Missing this will require waiting until the Age of Reformation to convert to a Protestant faith to continue the missions.\n\nCompleting the mission 'Another Story' unlocks the remaining missions, including the religious path, imperial reform path, and the full colonial line. Since the Euchite faith cannot be converted to actively, if you convert to Euchitism early, it is recommended to unlock the religious path early to help expand Euchite influence.\n\nOverijssel itself has almost no military bonuses but possesses strong diplomatic capabilities. Therefore, pay attention to the rewards from several missions in the mechanics line to determine your expansion strategy.\n\nUnlike the traditional path of reforming the Holy Roman Empire, Overijssel should follow the decentralizing reform path, not the centralizing one. The mission 'Checkmate with Knight and Bishop' will allow all provinces in the world to join the Holy Roman Empire. Additionally, completing the extra mission 'Imperial Federation' unlocks a decision allowing unconditional integration of all Holy Roman Empire members.
