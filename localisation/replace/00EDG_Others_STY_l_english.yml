EDG_string_start_H02:0 "§YAustria and the House of Babenberg§!\n\nIn the spring rain of 976 AD by the Main River, §YLeopold§!, ancestor of the House of Babenberg, had just received the vellum decree from the Holy Roman Emperor. This fierce warrior, who had rescued the emperor's banner in numerous battles, was granted the §Y"Eastern March of Bavaria"§! with the title of §YMargrave§!. He did not yet know he would become the founder of a five-hundred-year Austrian dynasty. When his descendants, bearing his coffin with three hundred heavy cavalry, arrived at Melk Abbey on the north bank of the Danube for reburial, his armor was revealed once more. The abbot wrote in his diary: 'The eagle's gaze upon this man's armor is more fearsome than the barbarians' curved blades.'\n\nOver the next century, this minor border nobility, through marriage and conquest, transformed the barren eastern marches into an eagle's nest linking Alpine passes and the Pannonian Plain. In 1246, the croaking of frogs by the Leitha River resembled a death knell for the Hungarians and nearly became the swan song of the Babenberg dynasty. Duke §YFrederick II§! was pierced through the chest by an arrow during his seventh charge. Had it not been for the jewel-inlaid gorget sewn into the lining of his mail, a relic from the Silk Road, the poisoned bone-tipped arrow would have ended the family's history. The following spring, three armories along a Danube tributary roared day and night, forging early plate armor with movable visors—equipment Italian mercenaries called the 'Viennese Iron Coffin'—which soon filled Babenberg coffers with Florentine gold.\n\nBut by 1444, Austria's §YHouse of Babenberg§! neared its end. The aged and lonely Duke §YErnst IV§! was childless. The Babenbergs, having ruled Austria for centuries, flickered like a candle in the wind, ready to extinguish at any moment. Gazing out the window, he watched the sunset's afterglow on the slowly flowing Danube, reflecting the intertwining of imperial glory and decline. A sense of helplessness welled within the duke; Austria's future seemed as elusive as ripples on the river's surface. He knew that even devout faith could not resist time's relentless march. Austria's future would inevitably pass into another's hands. Slowly closing his eyes, the duke prayed silently for God's protection over this land. Summoning his last strength, he unrolled a piece of parchment and took up quill and ink to deliver his final testament to the world, the most crucial question being who would inherit his throne.\n\nThe most obvious answer was his son-in-law—Frederick III, Duke of Württemberg of the House of Habsburg. Though not a blood relation, he was deeply skilled in statecraft, unwavering in his Catholic faith, and beloved by the people. Yet, the duke harbored reservations. The §YHouse of Habsburg§! was powerful; once in power, their cunning diplomacy could control the empire's lifeblood, potentially disrupting the hard-won balance achieved after the Hohenstaufen-Luxembourg strife. Sigismund of Bohemia, like himself, was nearing his end; his passing might create a new power vacuum.\n\nThe second choice was a distant relative, the §YCount of Styria§! from the House of Zähringen. Though young and capable, his inexperience and harsh temper made it difficult to command respect. Moreover, the §YHouse of Zähringen§! had long-standing friction with the Habsburgs over the prized territory of Austria. Choosing him risked civil war. The duke pondered long, his quill hesitating, weighing the pros and cons in his mind...\n\nThe duke's gaze finally settled on a third name on the parchment—a young prince from Bavaria's §YWittelsbach dynasty§!. Though not illustrious, he possessed notable intelligence and loyalty to the Empire. The duke knew that choosing him might maintain a balance of power. Yet, whether the young prince could navigate the complex situation remained unknown.\n\nIn the autumn Danube mists of 1444, Babenberg's Ernst IV gently stroked the gold-inlaid scimitar sent by a Turkish envoy. On his study walls, two maps overlapped in the candlelight: the Styrian mountains, their silver mines spreading like spiderwebs, and Vienna, outlined repeatedly in red ink. He knew well he had no son. After his passing, whither Austria's destiny? Perhaps only God knew. The duke took a deep breath, his quill finally touching the parchment, deciding to entrust Austria's future to one of them, hoping he would lead the realm toward new glory."

At that moment, he did not yet know he would become the founder of a five-hundred-year Austrian dynasty.

They argue that Austria was once part of the Kingdom of Bavaria and that the Wittelsbachs share ancient marital ties with the Babenberg dynasty, making them potential claimants to Austria as well.

EDG_STY_Austermark_Territory_desc:0 "The Ostmark was an early frontier region of the Holy Roman Empire. Its predecessor was the Eastern March of the Duchy of Bavaria, known as "Marcha orientalis" or "Ostarrichi." It served as a military defense zone against eastern threats. Its name derives from the Old German "Ostarrichi," meaning "Eastern Realm" or "Eastern Frontier."
