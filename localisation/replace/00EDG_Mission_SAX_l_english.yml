EDG_mission_SAX_1_3_desc:0 "Duke Henry the Lion—Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, founder of Munich, Brunswick, Lübeck, and Schwerin, and the Empire's greatest military leader—guided the German spearhead across the Elbe with his longsword, claiming vast tracts of arable land for the Germans. However, this powerful duke incurred the collective enmity of the Imperial princes, led by Emperor Barbarossa, forcing him to retreat to his Brunswick domains while his other territories were divided as spoils among nobles loyal to the Emperor. Henry the Lion's son, Otto IV, also found his imperial throne precarious; setbacks in his campaigns against France severely damaged the Welf family's prestige in Southern Germany, ultimately leading to further erosion of their domains. We must reclaim these territories of the Duchy of Saxony and rebuild a powerful Saxony."

EDG_mission_SAX_1_4_desc:0 "From the 10th century onward, German feudal lords gradually expanded into the basins of the Elbe, Oder, Vistula, and Neman rivers under the slogan "Drang nach Osten" (Drive to the East), encroaching upon the peoples of the Baltic coast and establishing territories such as the Duchy of Mecklenburg, the Duchy of Pomerania, the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and the state of the Teutonic Order. In 1410, the Teutonic Order was defeated by the combined forces of Poland, Lithuania, and Russia at the Battle of Grunwald, forcing a temporary halt to their eastward expansion. But we all know that Germans must expand eastward."

EDG_mission_SAX_1_6_title:0 "§MThe Sievich Edict§!"
EDG_mission_SAX_1_6_desc:0 "The Euchites are a sect that emerged around 370 AD, mentioned by the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople. It is said their leader, a man named Peter who called himself Christ, was sentenced to stoning for blasphemy. Before his execution, he told his followers that three days later he would ascend to heaven in the form of a wolf from his tomb. The core doctrine of the Euchites exhibits a unique hedonistic philosophy. They assert that the Trinity is perceived through carnal desire, that God transforms Himself into matter to unite with the perfect spirit, and that God manifests His presence through different sensations. The perfect form of humanity is achieved solely through prayer, not sacraments. According to some studies, this may derive from the libertine ideas of certain early Gnostic sects. As described by Michael Psellos, the Euchites engage in orgies and even acts that defy moral norms. Unquestionably, the Euchites were deemed a heretical faith by the Catholic Church and faced widespread persecution after the Imperial Diet, with many Euchite artisans and merchants driven from their homelands. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issued the famous Sievich Edict, allowing Euchite believers to come to our lands, where their faith would be protected. This will attract a great number of Euchite immigrants, who will bring us mature technology and substantial wealth."

Facing external pressures from Lotharingia and Scandinavia, the Emperor had no choice but to forge an alliance with the Duke of Saxony, entrusting successive Welf rulers with the heavy responsibility of Imperial Marshal. At this moment, Saxony could naturally rest content, as its forefathers did, with being the northwestern bulwark of the Empire. But for the House of Welf, which has given birth to an Emperor, another path clearly exists. Like the two great Duke Henrys—Henry the Fowler, founder of East Francia, and Henry the Lion, who fell short of ultimate success—to walk a path that truly represents North Germany."

EDG_mission_SAX_2_7_desc:0 "The 'Ninety-five Theses', posted by Martin Luther on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517, in protest against the Roman Church's sale of indulgences, are considered the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. In the Theses, Luther refuted the practice of selling 'indulgences,' opposing the method of purchasing remission from sin. Luther argued that the Pope does not have the power to remit sins, and therefore the claim that indulgences could forgive sins was erroneous. Luther not only questioned the efficacy of indulgences but also exposed their essence—exploitation. Its significance lies in being the first public denial of the Catholic doctrine that salvation could only be achieved through the Church and the Pope, thus gaining widespread acceptance across social strata. Luther's act enraged the Church. As events unfolded, the Theses became the spark that ignited the Reformation movement."

EDG_mission_SAX_2_9_title:0 "Wave of Reformation"
EDG_mission_SAX_2_9_desc:0 "Each of the Ninety-five Theses is a powerful blow against the errors and abuses of the Church.

In 1526, Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John of Saxony, along with princes from Lüneburg, Prussia, and Magdeburg, formed the Torgau League—the first princely organization sympathetic to Lutheranism. At the Imperial Diet of Speyer that same year, they rejected Archduke Ferdinand's proposal to enforce the Edict of Worms and prohibit the Reformation, instead passing decrees favorable to Lutheran doctrine: leaving decisions concerning faith to be handled by each individual territory."

EDG_mission_SAX_2_11_title:0 "Schmalkaldic League"
EDG_mission_SAX_2_11_desc:0 "Faced with the challenges posed by Catholicism, Protestant princes and cities swiftly united. Their representatives assembled in the southwestern Saxon mountain town of Schmalkalden and formed the Schmalkaldic League in February 1531. By this time, Lutheranism had spread throughout Germany. Territories and cities that had adopted Protestantism, besides Saxony and Hesse, included significant ones such as Ansbach-Bayreuth, Anhalt, Mansfeld, Brunswick-Lüneburg, Schleswig-Holstein, East Frisia, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Prussia, parts of Silesia, and the cities of Magdeburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Reutlingen, Konstanz, Strasbourg, Hamburg, Lübeck, and Rostock. Geographically, the vast lands of North Germany north of the Main River and the broad plains of East Germany had largely fallen into Protestant hands, while South Germany and Austria remained strongholds of the Catholic princes."

EDG_mission_SAX_2_14_desc:0 "In 1521, Charles V ordered Martin Luther to appear before the Imperial Diet of Worms for public defense or to recant his heretical doctrines. Luther's circumstances differed from those of Jan Hus; the vast majority of the German nation stood behind him, allowing him to travel to Worms without mortal peril. Luther's journey resembled a triumphant march. The city of Worms was controlled during the Imperial Diet by Imperial Knights led by Franz von Sickingen. Under the protection of the populace and these armed Imperial Knights, Luther made no concessions and refused to recant his teachings. In his defense before the Emperor, the Papal legate, and the estates of the Imperial Diet—first in German, then in Latin—he clearly replied: 'I cannot and will not recant anything, for it is neither safe nor wise to go against conscience. Unless I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by clear reason, for I do not trust either in the Pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves.'"

After the Duchy of Saxony was weakened by Barbarossa, the House of Welf could barely play the role of a local power. They long allied with the House of Wittelsbach, serving as traditional allies who shared common interests and breathed the same air as Bavaria. In the power struggles between the Wittelsbach and Luxembourg families over the Imperial throne, Saxony consistently acted as Bavaria's deputy, tirelessly working for the Bavarians, serving their inheritance claims in Holland, and engaging in a border conflict lasting nearly 32 years with the Elector of Upper Issel. However, as their southern German allies suffered successive defeats over the past decade, Saxony's voice within the Empire has also been increasingly challenged.

EDG_mission_SAX_5_12_desc:0 "Historical experience repeatedly proves that nations surrounded by powerful neighbors and lacking natural barriers rely exceptionally on military force to ensure security, and [Root.GetName] is no exception. The [Root.GetName] rulers led by the House of Welf have long held the position of Grand Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire, guarding the Empire's northern frontier. Under immense military pressure, [Root.GetName] established its first standing army. For a long time, [Root.GetName]'s belligerent culture, or what later generations called [Root.GetName]'s militarism, reflected a typical characteristic or tradition of the nation's development: a penchant for aggression and prowess in warfare, which is greatly linked to the environment our country finds itself in.\n\nFor a long time, the hard truth of military power has been fully confirmed by practice. Therefore, a deep reverence for military force has permeated all levels of [Root.GetName], leading to what historian Gerhard Schröder called the 'militarization of the middle class.' The [Root.GetName] middle class holds military power in the highest esteem, manifested not only in respect for the army but also in the militaristic imitation of civilian organizations and activities. Teachers saw themselves as officers on the training ground; middle-aged businessmen proudly displayed their reserve officer certificates. The militaristic tendencies of the middle class indicate that the [Root.GetName] middle class already viewed the military class as the highest stratum of society. This resulted in a distorted yet exhilarating state of national development for [Root.GetName], historically referred to as a 'police state,' where the nation's political life was entirely controlled by the army and military power, with the military becoming the ultimate factor dominating German politics.\n\nAs described by historian and writer Ludwig, 'For the witty Lüneburgers and other [Root.GetName] citizens, the General Staff building became a kind of Apollonian temple; and the soldiers in their trousers with broad red stripes who entered and left this building seemed to each have a halo of divinity around their heads.' There is no doubt that [Root.GetName] has shown a high tendency towards national militarization, and this military fervor will bring us more benefits."

At about the age of ten, Arminius was taken to Rome as a hostage and received a Roman education, growing up to become the commander of a Roman auxiliary cavalry unit. In AD 7, Publius Quinctilius Varus became the new governor of Germania. Arminius, leading Roman auxiliary cavalry under Varus's command, was able to return to his homeland of Germania for garrison duty. Arminius's first task was to scout the marching route for several Roman legions heading to their summer camp, which he accomplished. During his time in Germania, Roman extortion and heavy taxes stirred Arminius's resentment, and during this period, Arminius decided to embark on a path of resistance against Rome. In September AD 9, Varus led the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth Legions back from their summer camp to winter quarters in the east. Together with baggage trains and families, they numbered over 22,000 people. Arminius gathered various Germanic tribes to ambush the Romans. He lured them into the Teutoburg Forest through deception, and in three battles, he annihilated three Roman legions. Varus committed suicide."
