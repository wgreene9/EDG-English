Despite the martial prowess and imperial ambitions of §YRudolf I of the Habsburgs§!, the Babenberg line never died out, so the Habsburgs continued to expand within the §YSwabian§! region. Amid the collapse of the §YHohenstaufen dynasty§!, they seized vast Swabian lands, becoming the §YCounts of Württemberg§!. In later periods, they stood as the largest vassal under the §YDuke of Franconia§!, dominating Swabia, yet suffered defeat against the §YSwiss§!, losing their ancestral seat, §YEagle's Nest§!.\n\nThe former Count of Württemberg, §YAlbrecht§!, married the daughter of Emperor §YSigismund§! and was designated as Sigismund's §Yheir§!. However, Albrecht perished in the Varna Crusade against the §YTurks§!. His posthumous son, §YLadislaus§!, was too young to govern, so §YFrederick III§! assumed the regency of Württemberg.\n\nDuke §YHeinrich V§! of Franconia was aged and childless. He married his daughter to Frederick III, Count of Württemberg, and to Albrecht's father—making the current Duke of Franconia Frederick III's §Ymaternal grandfather§!. With the consent of the Franconian noble council, Heinrich V designated Frederick III as the §Yheir§! to the Duchy of Franconia. Once §YHeinrich V§! passed, the Habsburgs would rule Franconia.

At that time, Count Frederick III of Württemberg of the House of Habsburg, as Ernst IV's §yson-in-law§!, had been designated heir to the §YMargraviate of Austria§!.

EDG_string_start_SAX:0 "§YThe Decline of the Duchy of Saxony§!\nDuke §YHenry "the Lion"§! — Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, founder of Munich, Brunswick, Lübeck, and Schwerin, and the Empire's greatest military leader — guided the German spear across the Elbe with his sword, claiming vast arable lands for the Germans. Yet this powerful duke drew collective hostility from imperial princes led by Emperor Barbarossa, forcing him back to his Brunswick domains while other territories were carved up as spoils among nobles loyal to the emperor. Henry the Lion's son, §YOtto IV§!, teetered on the imperial throne; setbacks in campaigns against France severely damaged the §YWelf dynasty's§! prestige in southern Germany, ultimately leading to further erosion of §YWelf§! territories.\n\nIn subsequent history, the Welfs were largely relegated to local strongmen. They long allied with the §YWittelsbach dynasty§!, acting as traditional allies responding in kind to Bavaria. Amid the power struggles between the §YWittelsbachs§! and §YLuxembourgs§! for the imperial crown, Saxony served as the Wittelsbachs' lieutenant, tirelessly supporting Bavarian interests, securing their Dutch inheritance, and engaging in nearly 32 years of border conflicts with the §YElector of Upper Alsace§!. Yet as southern German allies suffered repeated defeats over the past decade, Saxony's voice within the Empire faced growing challenges. Moreover, under prolonged imperial scrutiny, Saxony became a favored destination for imperial tax collectors.\n\n§YImperial Marshal§!\nBut on Saxony's ancient soil, the Welfs remained the Empire's undisputed northwestern pillar. Confronting external pressures from §YLotharingia§! and §YScandinavia§!, the emperor had to ally with the Duke of Saxony. Several generations of Welf rulers were entrusted with the heavy responsibility of §YImperial Marshal§!. This was partly a compromise between Saxony and the emperor, for as the Empire crumbled step by step, if Saxony also rebelled, the emperor would lose not only the ample tax revenue of the Lower Rhine but also gain a new adversary.\n\n§YChallenges and Opportunities§!\nFor the Welf family, serving as Imperial Marshal, times were tough. To the west, the Flemish in the Low Countries struggled to forge their fragile national identity; §YUpper Alsace§! watched like a vulture eyeing the Empire's fate. To the north, descendants of Vikings, though they had forsaken Odin, still coveted imperial lands. To the east, heretics shouting vengeance for Jan Hus entrenched in §YMoravia§!. At this moment, Saxony could, like its forebears, remain content as the Empire's northwestern march. Yet for the §YWelf dynasty§!, which had produced an emperor, another path clearly existed. Like the two great Duke Henrys—Henry "the Fowler," founder of East Francia, and the nearly successful "the Lion"—to walk a path truly representing §YGermany§!."



EDG_string_start_LIT:0 "§YThe Grand Duchy of Lithuania§!\nThe §YLithuanians§! first emerged in history as adversaries of the Germanic peoples. Christians, holding the Bible in one hand and wielding swords in the other, self-proclaimed as the "Northern Crusaders," swept through Prussia and Livonia. Slavs adhering to ancient pagan beliefs found no refuge but in the forests of Lithuania. As more Slavs converted to §YChristianity§!, Lithuania, though a last sanctuary for pagans, inevitably saw Christian influences seep into Lithuanian hearts since Grand Duke §YMindaugas§! was forced to convert. Today, despite private retention of some pagan customs, Lithuanians see little difference between the Holy See of Rome preached by missionaries and their local temple Romuva. This fusion of Christian and Baltic pagan cultural traditions, along with the Papacy's long neglect of this remote, impoverished land, grants Lithuania rare §Yreligious freedom§! and §Ycultural freedom§! among other Catholic nations.\n\nHowever, due to underdeveloped commodity economy and entrenched landed aristocracy, Lithuanian politics long remained dominated by the §YGediminids§!, §YJagiellons§!, and §YRadziwiłłs§!, with the §YGediminids§! consistently holding the Lithuanian throne. These three families had distinct approaches: the Gediminids focused on deepening roots within Lithuania, believing cultivating their own land in this sparsely populated kingdom held more value than consuming population to conquer wastelands. The §YRadziwiłłs§!, however, had different considerations; their foundation lay in adept navigation of German and Polish courts, even called "Germans and Poles" by the Jagiellons. They consistently advocated attracting foreign peasants to cultivate Lithuanian wilderness.\n\nTo discuss 14th-century Lithuanian history, Vytautas is an unavoidable figure. Born in 1350 at the castle of Senieji Trakai ("Old Trakai"), he was the son of Kęstutis and his second wife Birutė, cousin to Jogaila, who became King of Poland as Władysław II. Vytautas's father Kęstutis and uncle Algirdas were brothers, never contesting power. Algirdas served as Grand Duke of Lithuania, while Kęstutis defended against the Teutonic Order. However, after Algirdas's death in 1377, his son Jogaila became Grand Duke, ending the harmony between Vytautas's father and uncle, as father and cousin began struggling for power. In 1380, Jogaila secretly signed the Treaty of Dovydiškės with the Teutonic Order against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered the treaty the following year, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and proclaimed himself Grand Duke. Yet Jogaila escaped, raised an army, and confronted Kęstutis and his son Vytautas. Though forces met, war never erupted; as Kęstutis prepared negotiations, he and Vytautas were arrested and imprisoned in Kreva Castle. A week later, Kęstutis was found dead in Kreva Castle.\n\nIn 1382, Vytautas escaped Kreva, was baptized in Catholic rite as Wigand, but later reverted to paganism. Seeking revenge against Jogaila, Vytautas joined several raids against him and, during further talks with the Order, signed the Treaty of Dubysa, reaffirming his commitment to Christianization and ceding Samogitia west of the Dubysa River to the Order. Thus, in summer 1383, the Teutonic Order entered Lithuania, seizing much of Samogitia and opening a corridor between the Prussian and Livonian branches.\n\nIn January 1384, Vytautas again promised to cede part of Samogitia to the Teutonic Order, with lands beyond the Nevėžis River returning to the Grand Duchy. Seeing the Order advance deep into Lithuania with Vytautas's aid, Jogaila offered to restore all lands and castles held by Vytautas's father Kęstutis in exchange for reconciliation. In July, Vytautas accepted, turning to burn several Teutonic castles and sever ties with the Order.\n\n§YVytautas§! participated in signing the §YUnion of Krewo§! with Poland in 1385 and was re-baptized in §YCatholic§! rite in 1386, taking the name Alexander. The treaty affirmed Jogaila's marriage to Polish Queen Jadwiga and his accession as King of Poland, also marking the rise of the Jagiellon branch of the Gediminid dynasty. After becoming King of Poland, Jogaila immediately appointed his brother Skirgaila as Regent of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, displeasing Vytautas.\n\nAfter §YSkirgaila's§! appointment as Grand Duke of Lithuania, the §YJagiellon dynasty§! formally entered Lithuanian politics. Though dismissive of the former two families' views, they acknowledged that immigrants from the Empire and Rus' benefited both the Lithuanian treasury and mutual checks.\n\nYet the poor governance of this Grand Duke presented §YVytautas§! an opportunity to regain the title. In 1389, he launched a civil war and attacked §YVilnius§!. Though the siege failed, it severely disrupted Gediminid plans. With no turning back, Vytautas had to promise adherence to the original 1384 agreement and cede Samogitia to the Order in exchange for assistance against Vilnius.\n\n§YJogaila§!, then §YKing of Poland§!, seeing the §YLithuanian civil war§! erupt, had to address Grand Ducal affairs and attempt to suppress Vytautas, arousing Polish noble discontent. As time passed, neither side achieved decisive results; the war stalemated. Realizing prolonged conflict benefited neither and only profited the §YTeutonic Order§!, in 1392 Jogaila sent envoys proposing Vytautas become Regent of the Grand Duchy to end the civil war. Vytautas gladly accepted, again burning Teutonic castles and returning to Vilnius. Jogaila and Vytautas signed the §YTreaty of Astrava§!, allowing Vytautas to reclaim territories promised to the Order and granting the Grand Duchy high autonomy within the union.\n\nThe Treaty of Astrava signaled the Gediminids' renewed control over the Grand Duchy. In 1393, representing the Gediminids, Vytautas accepted the Radziwiłł proposal and issued the §Y"Novhorodok Edict"§!, akin to a medieval Homestead Act. Though lacking a sound property law, the edict aimed to grant uncultivated lands to settlers regardless of nationality, rapidly boosting Lithuania's economy and earning Vytautas good repute.\n\nVytautas continued Algirdas's expansionist vision, proposing a joint campaign with Jogaila against the §YGrand Duchy of Kiev§! under Ivan I. Jogaila agreed. In 1395, Vytautas led forces into Ruthenia's heartland. Ivan I fought several fierce battles with Vytautas on the Ovruch plains; outcomes were mixed. Fearing Jogaila's reinforcements, Ivan retreated to Kiev. Vytautas pursued and besieged Kiev, but Ivan was prepared, leading to a protracted siege. Meanwhile, the promised Polish army under Jogaila was nowhere seen, yet Vytautas, believing Jogaila would soon arrive, refused to lift the siege. §YIvan I§! seized the moment, breaking through the weary Lithuanian forces and routing Vytautas. Ivan pursued, quickly capturing the §YMinsk Metropolitanate§! and §YTurov Principality§! with Belarusian support, threatening Vilnius. However, Vytautas had regrouped and prepared to reclaim lost lands, while Ivan realized his troops were exhausted. Yet rebellions triggered by defeat forced Vytautas to address internal issues first, compelling him to offer cession of Minsk and Turov to Ivan for peace. This unexpected gain pleased Ivan, who promised non-interference in Lithuanian affairs.\n\nThis failure shocked Lithuanian nobles and severely strained Polish-Lithuanian relations. Over subsequent years, the Teutonic Order continuously supported Vytautas's opponents in rebellions, all suppressed by Vytautas, though the Order still seized Samogitia amid chaos. Until 1409, when Samogitian rebels supported by Vytautas burned Skirsnemunė Castle, Polish forces led by Jogaila and Lithuanian forces under Vytautas advanced simultaneously toward the Teutonic castle of Marienburg—this time Jogaila did not miss the campaign. In 1410, Vytautas personally commanded the Grand Ducal army at the §YBattle of Grunwald§! (Tannenberg), where the Polish-Lithuanian alliance crushed the Teutonic Order, devastating the Knights.\n\nThis victory restored Vytautas's reputation and solidified Samogitia. Yet unresolved issues from the Kiev campaign still strained Polish-Lithuanian relations. Jogaila repeatedly attempted reconciliation, but Vytautas remained unmoved. In 1413, on the proposal of Polish and Lithuanian noble, Jogaila introduced the Union of Horodło, attempting to grant §YLithuanian Christian nobles§! rights equal to the §YPolish szlachta§!. Vytautas ignored it, nullifying the act and further distancing Lithuania from Poland.\n\nIn January 1429, Vytautas obtained the title of King of Lithuania with support from Holy Roman Emperor §YSigismund§!. However, envoys carrying the crown were intercepted by Polish nobles in autumn 1430, and a new crown arrived in Lithuania only days after Vytautas died at Trakai Island Castle.\n\nAfter Vytautas's death, the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania should have reverted to Jogaila for direct rule. But the Gediminids, long impatient with Poland, allied with the §YRadziwiłłs§! the following year, declaring independence and crowning Gediminid §YKęstutaitis I§! as King of Lithuania in 1431. The 69-year-old Jogaila was shocked and, with Polish noble assistance, prepared to suppress Lithuania, but God granted him no more time—he died in 1432 while leading troops to capture Podlasie and advancing toward Vilnius. The new Polish king, still a Jagiellon named §YWładysław III§!, quickly negotiated peace with Kęstutaitis I, ceding Podlasie in exchange for Lithuanian independence. Kęstutaitis I accepted, ending the 46-year Polish-Lithuanian union since the Union of Krewo in 1386.\n\nHistory's course is always unpredictable. When Władysław III fell at §YVarna§! and the Kingdom of Poland crumbled under internal strife and Hussite assaults from §YSandomierz§!, the Jagiellons, seeing the §YPolish crown§! shattered, led forces to reclaim southern homelands lost to Poles for years, shifting their focus from Poland to Lithuania.\n\nGermans argue that if the Holy Roman Empire cannot be considered a unified empire, whether Lithuania can be called a sovereign kingdom rather than a landowners' alliance remains debatable. In Balkan eyes, Lithuania is free yet barren land. But in Lithuanian hearts, this land beats like a heart, full of vitality."

EDG_string_start_POL:0 "§YThe Kingdom of Poland and the Shattered Polish Crown§!\n\nSince §YWładysław I§! unified Poland, significant risks of fragmentation and separatism persisted within the kingdom. His successor, §YKazimierz III§!, was a brilliant monarch, but he died young after ascending the throne, unable to complete the reforms aimed at curbing the magnates' independent tendencies. Succeeding Polish monarchs also failed in this endeavor.\n\nInternal issues did not define everything. In 1385, §YQueen Jadwiga of Poland§! signed an agreement with §YGrand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania§!, establishing the §YUnion of Krewo§!. According to the terms, Jogaila would be baptized, marry Jadwiga, and be crowned §YKing Władysław II of Poland§!. This agreement marked the beginning of the Polish-Lithuanian alliance, uniting them against the two knightly orders entrenched along the Baltic coast.\n\n§YYytautas's§! rebellion forced Jogaila to transfer the regency of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to him. Spending considerable time managing Lithuanian affairs stirred discontent among Polish nobles, compelling Jogaila to grant greater autonomy to the Grand Duchy under Vytautas's rule.\n\nWhen Vytautas invited Jogaila to jointly campaign against Kiev, Jogaila indeed prepared to march. However, just days before departure, Polish nobles opposed the move as pointless. Despite Jogaila's efforts, he could not persuade them. Only after news of Vytautas's defeat at Kiev reached the Polish court did the nobles consent to Jogaila sending reinforcements—though by then it was futile. This incident became a catalyst for the divergence between Poland and Lithuania, with significant impact, though initially suppressed by Queen Jadwiga.\n\nIn June 1399, Jadwiga and her newborn died during childbirth, leaving the 50-year-old childless Jogaila behind, further gradually weakening his royal authority. Though Jogaila remarried later, he could not erase the negative repercussions of Jadwiga's death. Over the next decade, under pressure from the §YTeutonic Order§!, Jogaila and Vytautas set aside past grievances, engaging the Order in several battles with mixed outcomes, until finally achieving a decisive victory at the §YBattle of Grunwald (Tannenberg)§!, stabilizing the Polish-Order border.\n\nSubsequently, tensions between Polish and Lithuanian nobles intensified. Several union acts failed to pass, driving Poland and Lithuania further apart. In 1430, Polish nobles maliciously intercepted the Lithuanian crown destined for Vilnius, highlighting the strained relations.\n\nFinally, in 1431, with support from the Gediminids and §YRadziwiłł family§!, §YKęstutaitis I§! of the §YGediminid dynasty§! was crowned §YKing of Lithuania§! and declared independence. The 69-year-old Jogaila was shocked and, with Polish noble assistance, prepared to suppress Lithuania, but God granted him no more time—he died in 1432 while leading troops to capture Podlasie and advancing toward Vilnius. The new Polish king, still a Jagiellon named §YWładysław III§!, quickly negotiated peace with Kęstutaitis I, ceding the §YPodlasie region§! in exchange for Lithuanian independence. §YKęstutaitis I§! readily accepted, ending the 46-year Polish-Lithuanian union since the Union of Krewo in 1386.\n\nTime then moved to 1444. After Władysław III fell at Varna, his death without marriage or heirs left the Polish throne vacant once more. The only remaining heir was a four-year-old posthumous son from Austria. While internal noble conflicts might have been reconcilable, Poland now faced deeper divisions.\n\nDue to the expanding scale of the §YHussite Wars§!, the ideas of §YJan Hus§! spread to southern Poland. Many minor nobles in §YLesser Poland§! converted to §YHussitism§!, believing it to be the true faith. Following Władysław III's death, they exploited the power vacuum to overthrow local magnates, seized control of Lesser Poland, and established a §Ynoble republic§! adhering to §YHussitism§!, with its highest authority named the §Y"Purification Council."§!\n\nSiemomysł III, Duke of Greater Poland, had long-standing ties with Holy Roman Emperor §YSigismund§!. He understood that Polish kings over the past century had sought to centralize power, while autonomy within the §YHoly Roman Empire's§! principalities grew. Thus, he aspired to become a West Slavic §Yimperial prince§! like Bohemia, thereby escaping the threat of the §YTeutonic Order§! and facilitating his influence into the §YPomeranian region§!. Consequently, §YSiemomysł III§! refused submission to the distant court in §YKraków§!, effectively achieving independence.\n\nThe north-south split in Poland encouraged the §YDuchy of Masovia§! to also lean toward independence. As a result, the central court in Kraków lost control over most of the realm, and the title of King of Poland became largely nominal. While the throne in Kraków remained vacant, the ruler of Greater Poland had no desire to become Duke of Kraków. The state based in Sandomierz was a republic. It seemed only the §YPiast ruler§! of Masovia could ascend as the new §Y"King of Poland."§!"

EDG_string_start_FYM:0 "§YThe Sahada Dynasty§!\nThe Sahada Dynasty was originally a minor state in the Yemen region. In 1342, the capable and warlike An-Nasir I ascended as Malik of Sahada. Though only 22 years old at the time, his bravery in battle and talent for recognizing able individuals were already well-known. By 1356, An-Nasir had unified Yemen and gradually expanded his conquests to surrounding areas. He entered the political power struggles of Arabia, filling local power vacuums. Sahada rule was highly decentralized, with regions retaining considerable autonomy, which facilitated the dynasty's rapid expansion. By 1374, An-Nasir I had become a regional power in Arabia, controlling nearly half the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn 1380, the last Bahri Sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate, Hajji II, was expelled from Cairo. However, the Burji line could not quickly stabilize the situation, sparking a Mamluk civil war with intense conflict that severely damaged Egypt's economy. Bahri Sultan Hajji II sought aid from the Sahada Dynasty, promising to cede territories in southwestern Arabia to Sahada's Grand Malik An-Nasir I and offering substantial annual tribute. After careful consideration, the 60-year-old An-Nasir I recognized this as Allah's best birthday gift. He led his army into Egypt, but after helping the Bahri Sultan quell the rebellion, he turned against the Bahri regime, ultimately overthrowing the Mamluks to become the Grand Malik of Egypt. Thus, a powerful state spanning Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula re-emerged in the world.\n\nHowever, the Sahada regime was highly unstable. Though superficially at its peak, it was internally fragile. Military nobles within the empire still wielded immense power; for instance, the Emirs of Syria held great autonomy, and many Arab tribes continuously sought independence.\n\nTo maintain the support of various domestic factions, Sultan An-Nasir I enacted the Buhayra Act in 1390, clarifying the political and economic rights of numerous interest groups, embedding feudal relations into the empire's core. The military-administrative system was built on feudal ties between Egyptian Mamluks and Arab tribal alliances. A tax-farming system was implemented nationwide, with local Emirs and Sheikhs required to pay tribute and provide military service to the Sahada Sultan, who would not overly interfere in local affairs. Mamluk factions played a crucial, even pivotal, role within the empire. Both Bahri and Burji Mamluks controlled substantial political-military resources and their own feudal economic bases, long posing a significant threat to the Sahada Sultan—yet they were also the military force the Sultan most relied upon. Gaining Egyptian Mamluk support was the foremost task for every Sahada Sultan upon accession.\n\nSince An-Nasir I's death in 1391, the Sahada Dynasty faced continuous rebellions and turmoil. The reigning Sahada Sultan was the equally shrewd Muhammad I. As An-Nasir I's fourth and only surviving son, Muhammad was naturally gifted and had accompanied his father in campaigns and governance from a young age, equipping him to handle the dynasty's crises and preventing the crumbling empire from collapsing under its own weight. Under Muhammad I's rule, though still somewhat turbulent, Egypt experienced economic and cultural prosperity. As the Sahada Dynasty adhered to Shiism while most Muslims in its territories were Sunnis, religious tolerance was necessary. This open and inclusive atmosphere made the Sahada capital, Fayyum, a center of Islamic scholarship, attracting scholars from the Maghreb and Persia to teach and exchange ideas in local mosques, fostering cultural development in Egypt.\n\nAfter Muhammad's death, however, the Sahada Empire struggled under his successor, Safar I. Meanwhile, an Emir family based in Rosetta, Nile Delta, gradually expanded their influence within the dynasty, known as the "Rosetta Clan." By mediating between the Bahri and Burji factions, they gained immense influence in Egypt, becoming a key player in Sahada's political games.\n\nWhile relying on Egyptian Mamluks and Arab tribal alliances, the Sahada Dynasty also attempted to balance domestic forces by introducing external elements, such as Greek Orthodox mercenaries, Coptic bureaucrats, and Turkmen mercenary corps from the north. Turkmen mercenaries played vital roles in both Sahada's external campaigns and internal stability.\n\nThe empire had two heads: one spiritual, the old capital Sahada, believed to be the city where Noah's son Shem resided, housing the empire's glorious past; the other practical, with the Nile as its arteries. Between these heads, a narrow corridor linked them to the imperial body—a trade route along the Red Sea, also connecting the holy cities of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, representing the Prophet's life journey, symbolizing the empire's prosperity and strength. Yet soon, all this would vanish.\n\n§YThe Rosetta Clan§!\nAhmad Rosetta carried the blood of Prophet Muhammad in his veins. As a noble Sayyid, he received the finest education from childhood, capable of reciting the Quran backwards. Ahmad learned early to cloak himself in humility, appearing non-threatening among Mamluks and other military nobles, yet harboring boundless ambition within. In his youth, he campaigned with Muhammad I, deeply impressed by this brave and wise Sultan, knowing he could never surpass his sovereign, resigning to serve loyally for the remainder of Muhammad's life.\n\nAfter Muhammad I's death, Ahmad Rosetta cautiously spent years observing his new liege. Once confident in his prospects, he secretly built his own power base. Respected and militarily accomplished, Ahmad became a figure both Bahri and Burji factions were willing to compromise with and obey. Now, Ahmad stands ready to seize state power as the Sahada Dynasty descends into chaos.\n\n§YThe Fatimid Caliph§!\nSulayman ibn Dawud, descendant of Fatimah and Ali, the Most Exalted Sayyid, the last of the Fatimid line. In 1185, an unexpectedly pregnant mother was smuggled out of Cairo by night, and thus Prince Sulayman was born in freedom, preserving the Fatimid bloodline—his birth seen as Allah's grace. In youth, he was captured and placed under house arrest by the Ayyubids. To the Kurds, he, like his father, should remain a caged bird. Yet infidel turmoil gave this Imam's heir an opportunity. In 1205, on a Cairo night, Prince Sulayman and a few loyal attendants slipped away amidst unrest, evading Ayyubid surveillance. Leading a band more akin to bandits than an army, he rode west, bypassing Christian-held Tunis to reach the Maghreb where his ancestors founded their dynasty. He trusted his judgment. At that time, the Almohads, embroiled in Tangiers' conflicts, had little reach eastward. Kabylia and Tlemcen cities followed their own lords; Barbary Coast order neared collapse. The prince raised his banner, and Ismailis discontent with the Almohads and Sunni nobles who once clung to them now harbored ulterior motives, welcoming their Imam incarnate. Once, the Fatimids rose from the Maghreb coast; today, he was born to lead the Maghreb's Shiites. Prince Sulayman arrived with but eight riders; by the time he arrayed his forces outside Kabylia, tens of thousands followed. News of Kabylia's fall spread like a winter gale; Maghreb cities surrendered in succession. The planned "holy war" by Crusaders in Tunis against the Maghreb also fizzled due to major defeat in Egypt."

EDG_string_start_AKK:0 "§YThe Timurid Empire§!\nThough the hooves of §YTimur§! had long departed these lands, the fear and death he left behind lingered. After the collapse of the Timurid Empire, the beyliks of Anatolia and Iraq plunged into immediate chaos. Zoroastrians, Nestorian Christians, Sunnis, and Shiites vied for power across Persia and Khorasan. §YShah Rukh§! failed to restore the empire's stability, and Timurid control shrank back to Transoxiana. Yet Timur's descendants did not cease their struggles.\n\n§YThe White Sheep and the Black Sheep§!\nAmid the aftermath of the Timurid collapse, the §YAq Qoyunlu§! quietly rose from the shadows. They could not displace the §YArtuqids§! in Iraq or the §YAyyubids§! ruling Kurdistan but managed to annex weaker entities westward, such as the Beylik of Dulkadir and the Beylik of Ramazan, extending their influence to the eastern Mediterranean coast and making §YAleppo§! their territory. After §YUzun Hasan§! ousted his incompetent elder brother, placing him in Mush, he was destined to embark on his great conquest.\n\nYet the §YQara Qoyunlu§! were not so fortunate. Amid the turmoil, they rose boldly and swiftly crumbled. The Artuqids stood firm under the sabers of strong rulers, while Nestorian Christians in Iraq supported the Qizil Qoyunlu tribe in gaining independence. Worse, the Safavid order and the Maragheh order under its support continuously eroded the Qara Qoyunlu's foundations, and even Shiite followers grew alienated. All this forced the Qara Qoyunlu to retreat into §YTabriz§!. In the chaos, the legitimate Qara Qoyunlu prince, §YJahan Shah§!, remained long in exile, his tribe leaderless, awaiting the return of their true §YShah§!."

EDG_string_start_GOL:0 "§YThe Golden Horde and the Eastern European States§!\nIn 1380, §YTokhtamysh§! of the White Horde, aided by §YTimur§!, defeated the powerful emir Mamai of the Great Horde, gaining control over the core territories of the Golden Horde and becoming its Khan. However, the Horde had endured bloody internal strife: the tenth Khan, §YTini Beg§!, was murdered by his brother Jani Beg, who was then poisoned by his son Berdi Beg. Two younger brothers subsequently followed the same pattern, plunging the Golden Horde into its first great turmoil. Since then, such history repeated frequently; Khans' reigns lasted less than the time it took their livestock to fatten. To this day, incessant quarrels and warfare continue... weakening control over the western Kievan Rus region. The Prince of Kiev, §YIvan I§! of the Rurik dynasty, became the Horde's agent in Kievan Rus, yet he harbored his own ambitions.\n\nBy the late 14th century, Ivan I consolidated his position in §YKievan Rus§!, successfully repelling invasions from the §YGrand Duchy of Lithuania§! and even seizing the §Yprincipalities of Turov and Minsk§!. Ivan I died of illness in Kiev in 1440 at age 83. His son, §YAndrei I§!, proved incompetent and despotic. At Ivan's funeral, he disrespected the feudal rights of other princes, and to curry favor with the Horde, imposed oppressive levies across Kievan Rus, sparking the §YKievan Rus Civil War§! beginning in December 1443. The principalities of Galicia-Volhynia, the Zaporizhian Hetmanate, and Chernigov declared independence, each claiming the right to become the new §YGrand Prince of Kiev§!, plunging into a chaotic struggle for the city. Meanwhile, the Prince of Turov and the Archbishop of Minsk watched from the sidelines, striving to defend against northern Lithuanians without the Grand Prince's protection.\n\nToday, the §YGolden Horde§! is gone; its §YTatar§! successors, oblivious to the growing strength of surrounding enemies, vie only for its legacy. This once-great empire of §YGenghis Khan's§! son §YJochi§! has splintered into several khanates, each seeking to dominate the steppe.\n\nThe most direct successor is the §YGreat Horde§!. Khan Küchük Muhammad controls the cities of Sarai and Astrakhan, yet steppe tribes turn deaf ears to his commands. Tribes have successively broken from his rule, and the Khan has yet to reverse the situation.\n\nA Khan who does not strike fear in neighboring lands is no true Khan; without a powerful Khan's watch, the once mere tax-collector, the §YGrand Duchy of Moscow§!, has greatly expanded. Now divided into two parts, the rulers of §YMoscow§! and §YTver§! vie for supremacy in northeastern Rus. This civil war will not last indefinitely. Should Muscovites or Tverians achieve unification, they will certainly seek to cast off the Tatar yoke and conquer the steppe themselves. Similarly, the §YRuthenian princes§! have greatly benefited from the Golden Horde's disintegration: they have achieved de facto independence and will likely continue to threaten the nomads.\n\n§YUlu Muhammad§! of the §YKazan Khanate§! twice declared himself Khan of the Golden Horde, but both were short-lived regimes. With support from local Bulgar nobles, he seized Kazan, establishing a new khanate on the northern steppes. Kazan, a vital trade hub, easily leverages nearby deposits of precious and practical metals. As the wealthiest among the Tatar states, Kazan thus holds both a bright future and the attention of greedy invaders.\n\nBy 1444, the §YCrimean Khanate§! has perished. The §YDoukas§! family from Byzantium seized the Genoese spoils on the peninsula, ruling over Azov. Though their rule is unstable, it clearly threatens the security of eastern khanates.\n\nThe §YUzbek Khanate§! controls vast steppes, possessing wealth and strategic advantages superior to other Golden Horde successors. Yet this vast khanate is internally fragile; once its leader, §YKhair Khan§!, passes, the powerful Uzbek Khanate may swiftly descend into chaos and ruin. To lay claim to any part of Genghis Khan's legacy, they must adopt opportunism as their guiding principle. Fortune favors them, as their neighbor, the §YTimurids§!, teeters on the brink of collapse and civil war. A competent Khan should seize the moment while Timurid attention is diverted, capturing §YSamarkand§! or §YBukhara§!."

EDG_string_start_SHY:0 "§YThe Uzbek Khanate§!\nIf the Pax Romana represented peace under civilization, then the Pax Mongolica could only be called peace under barbarism, and the §YUzbek Khanate§! stands as its finest exemplar.\n\nAfter the collapse of the §YGolden Horde§!—the Ulus of Jochi—the 16-year-old §YAbu'l-Khayr Khan§! journeyed eastward against the path of his ancestors' conquests and was hailed as the Great Khan of the Uzbeks. This vast empire, stretching from the §Yeastern slopes of the Ural Mountains§! to the fertile lands of §YTransoxiana§!, could be considered a miniature version of the §YEmpire of Genghis Khan§!. The Great Khan rules over subjects from all corners, speaking diverse tongues, profiting from conflicts and intrigues between different faiths or tribes, thereby managing vast populations with minimal governance costs, needing only to instruct close advisors.\n\nNow, the Uzbek Khanate is in its ascendant phase. To the south, the §YTimurid Empire§!, though long fragmented, still controls the fertile Fergana Valley and the central Asian heartland city of §YSamarkand§!. Over the past decade, raids and minor conflicts between the two in Transoxiana have been constant, with the balance of power maintaining a delicate equilibrium. Yet it is foreseeable that after the aged §YShah Rukh§! dies, the Timurid Empire will crumble, shattering this balance completely. All Abu'l-Khayr Khan must do is wait. To the east, the §YChagatai Khanate§!, nominally under the protection of the §YYuan dynasty§!, constantly threatens the khanate's eastern borders, with impending warfare likely to ignite along the Chu River frontier. To the west lies the legacy of the former Golden Horde: the tenth Khan, §YTini Beg§!, murdered by his brother Jani Beg, who was then poisoned by his son Berdi Beg, followed by two younger brothers repeating the pattern, plunging the Golden Horde into its first great chaos. Since then, such history has repeated frequently; Khans' reigns lasted less than the time it took their livestock to fatten. To this day, incessant quarrels and warfare continue…\n\nYet this does not mean the Uzbek Khanate can act with impunity. Governing such vast tribal confederations is no easy task—the western §YNogai§! tribes are already restless, while the eastern Kazakh tribes remain ambivalent. Should the Uzbek Khanate halt its conquests, rebellion and secession will surely follow. None know what will become of the Uzbek Khanate after Abu'l-Khayr Khan's death; not even he himself knows where the khanate will head.\n\nReligious and tribal conflicts perpetually loom over the khanate. Every individual ascending the §Ykhan's throne§! must prove that he and his descendants are the undisputed Great Khan—by any means necessary, be it divine mandate or §Ymassacre§!. Peace is never the khanate's refrain. War drums thunder, hooves pound like rain; every Khan will emulate their ancestors of ancestors, the great world-conqueror Genghis Khan, setting out from the steppe to conquer the world, then sinking roots within, truly ruling the world…\n\nA shattered empire, chaotic politics, corrupt bureaucracy—all pave the way for the Uzbek Khanate's expansion. And Abu'l-Khayr Khan will lead the khanate toward an even more distant future, just like his ancestors of old. The §Ydescendants of Shayban§! have no time to waste. Making the edges of the earth hear the neighing of warhorses and the melodic strains of the horse-head fiddle is the inherent mission of nomadic peoples. §YEither establish a legacy for ten thousand generations§!, §Yor become bleached bones upon the steppe§!."

EDG_string_start_HZB:0 "§YThe Regency of the Ilkhanate§!\n\nIn the western half of Persia, amidst the Zagros Mountains, lies the land of the Kurdish §YHaradabi Dynasty§!. Known by the epithet "Thousand Horses," employing cavalry—a force typically dominant on plains—effectively in the rugged Zagros terrain is naturally more challenging, yet the §YKurds§! ride their steeds across mountains as if on level ground. During the Ilkhanate period, the Haradabi Dynasty existed as a vassal, ruling the barren highlands that Mongol conquerors disdained.\n\nBut when the Khans forgot their horse-riding traditions, indulging in the comforts of Soltaniyeh, only those holding the whip could remain unscathed amid the empire's total collapse in 1335. Several successors barely warmed the Ilkhanate's throne before passing it on. Of course, compared to the §YChobanids§! of the Tayichi'ud clan controlling the northwest and the §YJalayirids§! holding fertile lands, the Haradabi Dynasty, curled up in the mountains, seemed unlikely to contend. Yet the Haradabi's keen senses discovered a means to bolster their legitimacy.\n\nAfter the §YGolden Horde's§! armies sacked Tabriz, the so-called Ilkhanate ruler, the obscure §YNushirwan§!, disappeared amidst the flames. The Haradabi secretly installed the deposed §YGreat Khatun Sati Beg§!. On whether to enthrone a female sovereign, these Kurds engaged in fierce internal debate, but to enhance legitimacy, a group disguised as merchants ultimately smuggled this daughter of Öljaitü out of the city hidden within a Persian carpet. Sati Beg entered her fourth marriage after unions with Amir Choban, Arpa Khan, and Suleiman Khan. As various claimants either met unnatural ends or succumbed to illness, by 1330, §YGreat Khatun Sati Beg§! became the sole legitimate heir. Reluctantly, all factions acknowledged this §Ypuppet Khatun's§! legitimacy. After Sati Beg's death in 1345, her son Surgan and his descendants inherited the §Ypuppet khanship§! to this day."

EDG_string_start_HUN:0 "§YThe Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen§!\n\nIf §YBohemia§! is the jewel of the Empire, then §YHungary§! is the crown guarding that jewel. Sigismund I of the House of Luxembourg, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia and Hungary, was a figure who made the entire Empire—indeed, Europe—tremble. Before the hussars of the Magyars, any orderly formation was shattered. Hungary, bolstered by imperial support, expanded aggressively across Eastern Europe, seemingly unstoppable, until the disastrous §YVarna Crusade§!. The Serbian Emperor's treacherous betrayal led the Empire to an unprecedented defeat. The Emperor's heir, §YDuke Albrecht§! of Württemberg, and Polish King §YWładysław III§! both fell on the battlefield. Hungary, which had contributed significantly to the Empire, suffered heavy losses. Countless Magyar nobles closely tied to the Empire perished under Turkish sabers; to exaggerate, "every castle held a funeral."\n\nYet the ambitious János Hunyadi successfully escaped the chaotic battle, bringing back the banner Sigismund had given his son-in-law—though rumors claimed this banner was obtained through a shameful deal with the Turks. Despite the defeat, his pre-war fame in Hungary turned the disaster into a stepping stone for his meteoric rise. §YSigismund§! appointed him to oversee all Hungarian affairs, effectively making him Regent of Hungary. Unsurprisingly, should anything befall the old Emperor, it would only be a matter of time before §YRegent János§! became the uncrowned king of Hungary.\n\nWith the collapse of the §YKingdom of Poland§! and the §YOttoman Empire§!, Hungary's greatest external threat shifted from the east to the once-closest Empire in the west. Hungary and the Empire were destined to part ways. Meanwhile, the Habsburgs of Württemberg were determined to reclaim the old Emperor's entire legacy. Though peace remained possible, the two sides might inevitably resort to arms. To the south, the Serbian Empire, beset by internal and external troubles, would be consumed by emerging forces. The Muslim offensive quieted amid Ottoman internal strife. In the fractured lands of the Polish Kingdom, even the banner of §YHussitism§! rose. Before Magyar might, the Slavs could only follow. For the Hungarians, some wounds from the §YVarna Crusade§! had long healed, but the scar with the Empire remained permanent."

EDG_string_start_H04:0 "§YThe Electorate of Overijssel§!\n\nThe lineage of the §YGrüfenger family§! traces back to the legendary first §YKing of Friedland, Radbod§!, straddling history and myth. This ancestor dedicated his life to resisting the encroachment of the §YFranks§! into the Low Countries and the spread of Christianity. Had he known his descendants would not only integrate into the Germanic realms but also convert to Christianity, one wonders what he would think. The Grüfenger family ruled §YHolland§! until the 13th century. When their leader, Count §YWillem II§! of Holland, inherited the claim of the anti-king §YHeinrich Raspe§! and was elected as a rival king against the §YHohenstaufens§!, this count from the imperial frontier could no longer remain detached from the Empire's storms. Naturally, the Hohenstaufens, incensed by this upstart count daring to oppose them, secretly encouraged the Frisians to revolt. Willem II died on the battlefield while suppressing the rebellion.\n\nHis son, §YFloris V§!, devoted his life to two goals: continuing his father's anti-imperial policy and pursuing a claim to the §YScottish§! throne (though it must be noted, Floris V's claim derived from his great-great-great-grandmother—a distant link and his status as a foreign lord meant Scots never seriously considered him). To this end, he allied with England's §YEdward I§!. Though this alliance nearly collapsed over the dispute of the Duchy of Guelders, long-standing wool trade relations between the two nations ultimately preserved it. Backed by the English king, the Count of Holland aggressively expanded in the Low Countries. The Hohenstaufens, mired in internal strife, could no longer restrain this frontier lord; as long as he did not covet the throne, all was well. After Floris V's death, the Low Countries split: the elder branch inherited the wealthy County of Holland, while the younger branch was granted the poorer Issel delta region, becoming the §YCount of Overijssel§!.\n\nThe struggling Hohenstaufen dynasty ultimately failed to pass on their imperial crown. Rising powers, the §YLuxembourgs§! and §YWittelsbachs§!, eyed the Empire. After the 1260 Imperial Diet ruling (known as the "Old Emperor's Inheritance Judgment"), presided over by the newly minted electors, the §YArchbishop of Münster§! and §YArchbishop of Mainz§!, declared: §YFranconia§! would be inherited by descendants of Conrad, son of Henry IV (this descendant of the dethroned §YKing of Italy§! had by then fallen to poverty in Rome, scraping a living writing manuscripts), as neither great house wished the other to claim such vast legacy. Similarly, when the main Grüfenger line died out in 1341 and the Bavarians eyed Holland through inheritance claims, the Luxembourger Emperor §YHenry VII§! immediately backed the junior branch, sparking the §Y"Holland Succession War."§! Unfortunately for the emperor and the Grüfengers, they were routed at the Battle of Ingolstadt, and wealthy Holland slipped from their grasp.\n\nAs compensation for the defeated, but more to check his main rival extending influence into the Low Countries, the emperor transferred the title of §Y"Viceroy of Frisia"§! (created ad hoc for this grant) and full administrative rights over the §YPrince-Bishopric of Münster§! to Overijssel. Losing an imperial bishopric was preferable to losing imperial dominance. Along with Münster, the §Yelectoral privilege§! granted to Münster in 1260 was also transferred. However, times changed. With Bavarian lands split three ways, Overijssel, once a counterbalance, became an unwieldy problem for the Empire.\n\nOverijssel faces two paths: one leads to the sea, beyond the North Sea's waves, to legends of lands where grapes grow, beyond the lands of the §YBritons§!—the legacy of Floris V. The other leads into the Empire, following ancestor Willem II's path: in times of imperial turmoil, only the bold endure.\n\nThough East Frisia seemingly belonged under Overijssel's jurisdiction, it was always administered under the County of Holland and, after Willem II's death, ruled by the Grüfenger elder branch, lost along with Holland in the succession war to the §YWittelsbachs§!. However, as §YEast Frisia§! was geographically an exclave of Holland, difficult to manage, it was re-established as a separate county. In 1381, Count Okko II of East Frisia governed poorly, causing peasant suffering. That same year, with Grüfenger support, local peasants overthrew him and declared §Yindependence§!. The Wittelsbachs prepared to suppress the revolt but, embroiled in civil war and hindered by the Grüfengers, ultimately abandoned the effort. East Frisia formally declared independence in 1382, attempting to establish a §Ypeasant republic§!. The emperor never recognized this independence, so it remained, in essence, a rebel territory. Yet, considering strategic interests and future integration plans, the Grüfengers §Yguaranteed East Frisia's independence§! that same year. Relations have remained good since, with the Grüfengers awaiting the right moment to absorb it into their realm."

EDG_string_start_LOT:0 "§YThe Ancient Carolingian Dynasty§!\nDuring the reign of Charles the Fat, the entire realm once ruled by Charlemagne was briefly reunified, and he was crowned §YEmperor§! by Pope John VIII in 881. However, his rule was weak, and imperial unity was largely nominal. In 887, Charles the Fat was deposed and replaced by his nephew, Arnulf, Duke of Carinthia. Charles's downfall marked the onset of §Rchaos and collapse§! for the unified Frankish state. The poor geopolitical situation of §YLotharingia§! destined it to be threatened from all sides. Yet, thanks to Emperor Arnulf's exceptional political balancing act, he bequeathed Lotharingia to his youngest son, §MZwentibold§!, rather than to §M"the Child" Louis§!. In exchange, Louis received §MEast Francia§! as compensation. Naturally, for Louis "the Child," submitting to a younger brother was unacceptable. He and his vassals spread rumors that Zwentibold was actually illegitimate. But the physically weak and possibly depressed Louis ultimately became mired in East Francia's power struggles, while Lotharingia remained under Zwentibold's descendants. During the Carolingian era, Lotharingia's kings faced §Rhostility and indifference§! from other Carolingian lines. However, as the splintered Carolingian dynasties gradually declined, this "bastard" dynasty, having outlasted all more legitimate Carolingian heirs, became the last to dare call themselves §Ydescendants of Charlemagne§!.\n\nIn 1079, amid deteriorating relations between Pope §MGregory X§! and Holy Roman Emperor §MHenry IV§!, Lotharingian King §YFrederick I§! seized the opportunity, paying a substantial tribute to the Pope, who personally crowned him §Y"Successor of Charlemagne and Roman Emperor."§! But as Gregory X failed in his war against Henry IV, this imperial claim became a mere footnote. The 12th century saw Lotharingia locked in a prolonged tug-of-war with the Holy Roman Empire. Outwardly, Lotharingian King §YLouis III§!, expanding territories, appeared victorious. He pushed his sword to the Rhine, annexing numerous imperial princes and even occupying §MCologne§! and §MTrier§!, nearly leading to his excommunication. To appease the Holy See, the king sent a ship laden with gold plundered from the Empire up the Tiber, silencing the Pope. Yet prosperity often sows seeds of destruction. The §Yimperial princes§!, though subordinate to Lotharingia, harbored resentment while maintaining high autonomy and local militias. After §YLouis III's§! death, royal control over local princes gradually eroded. Notably, one of the German principalities annexed by Louis III was the §YDuchy of Jülich-Berg§!, ruled by the §YHouse of Jülich-Berg§!, whose lineage traced back to Louis "the Child." The Jülich-Berg family lost §MJülich§! to Louis's invasion but retained the County of Berg, ruling §MBerg§! thereafter.\n\n§YThe Divided Kingdom of Lotharingia§!\nBy the 13th century, Lotharingia was nearly submerged in chaotic court coups. Local powerbrokers continuously championed "the most legitimate Carolingian princes" like waves from the North Sea. Thrones changed hands frequently, with child kings emerging in an endless stream. Proud-blooded yet useless child kings constantly traded greater autonomy for noble support. Vassals scarcely needed to send their wealth to the royal court. The "Chaotic Century" gradually hollowed out the kingdom. The Kingdom of Lotharingia lost any sense of cohesion, as dukes formed factions based on language and blood, divided into §YFrench§! and §MGerman§! camps. The pro-French faction gradually gained dominance over centuries, continuously attempting to weaken German nobles' power.\n\nDespite Lotharingia's strategic position at Western Europe's crossroads, numerous dukes and bishops remained estranged from the royal court. Cultural and linguistic differences rendered Lotharingia a kingdom "in name only." The kingdom's §YGermans§! eagerly sought to break away from a kingdom constantly trying to weaken their power, turning instead to the more decentralized Empire ruled by their Germanic kinsmen. By 1444, the leader of the German nobles was Jülich-Berg Duke §MGerhard§!, who during the "Chaotic Century," seized §YCologne§!, a Christian holy site, and continuously incited the Archbishop of Cologne §Ragainst the king§!. Numerous contradictions cast a shadow over the kingdom's future.\n\n§YThe Four Kingdoms' War§!\nIn 1429, the rebellion of the §YDuke of Alençon§! against the French king ignited internal strife in France. With England, Lotharingia, and the Kingdom of Arles joining the war, it became known as the §Y"Four Kingdoms' War."§! Lotharingian King §YLouis VII§! seized the opportunity to invade France, defeating and capturing Hugues VI at Caen. Since Louis VII's mother was a Capetian, he forced Hugues VI to sign the §Y"Treaty of Caen,"§! demanding Hugues VI disinherit the French Dauphin Hugues VII and name Louis VII heir to the French throne. Hugues VI soon died of infection, and Louis VII claimed the French crown, intending to be crowned at Reims. However, Dauphin Hugues succeeded in being crowned King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name §MHugues VII§!, later called "the Victorious," with Joan of Arc at his side. By 1438, the French repelled Lotharingian, English, and Arlesian attacks, ending the §YFour Kingdoms' War§! and shattering Lotharingia's westward ambitions.\n\n§YLouis VII and Bernadette§!\nLouis VII understood that for Lotharingia, maintaining internal and external balance was the only hope for survival in a tight spot. To gain recognition from German magnates, Louis Carolingian married a young and beautiful §YHohenstaufen§! princess from §YSicily§!. However, cost of the wedding was almost entirely covered by taxes levied on his his vassals, earning Louis the informal title "the Beggar King." After thirty years of maneuvering, Louis barely maintained his role as mediator between the two factions, but he knew that after his death, this royal position could not be sustained. His heir—his only daughter, §YBernadette§!—was born outside the Salic Law's acceptance. Though he made vassals sign recognition of his heir before God's altar, paper held no power before swords. Much evidence suggested Duke Gerhard was ready to lead German nobles against the future queen.\n\nYet Louis VII, aware of his advanced age and impending death, could obviously produce no more heirs. He wondered if he would live to see Bernadette grow up, but the young princess's innate wisdom brought rare smiles to his face.\n\nThe Capetian dynasty of France was strengthening centralization and expanding royal domains through crusades against southern Cathars. The French king, especially the victorious Hugues, coveted Lotharingian lands, ready to attack at any sign of weakness. England, though having experienced turmoil and decline in recent decades, if Albion were reunified, their ambitions lay just a step from Lotharingia. Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, aged and mired in the Hussite Wars, might have no time to look west now, but the future German King Frederick III, unanimously supported by imperial electors, was in his prime and keen to extend Habsburg influence to the Empire's western borders. Meanwhile, Lotharingia's Louis Carolingian was past fifty, his only child a girl whom Lotharingian nobles believed could never successfully inherit. Some even claimed, "Lotharingia was born in injustice and shall die in disgrace."\n\nIn 1443, the §MCount of Metz§! spearheaded a rebellion, known as the §R"Metz War."§! German princes schadenfreuded as the king bogged down in Metz's local forces, while French-aligned vassals offered no aid, conserving strength for future crises. In the storm, Lotharingia resembled Noah's Ark in towering waves. §YBernadette§! was destined to be isolated, caught in rapids, helpless and adrift. Only true Lotharingians, neither French nor Germans, could possess their homeland."
