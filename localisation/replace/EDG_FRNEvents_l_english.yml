EDG_FRNEvents.0.desc:0 "The history of Frankfurt dates back to around the beginning of the Common Era when the Rhine and Danube rivers formed the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. However, these two rivers were not connected, leaving a defenseless gap between them. To address this, the Romans constructed a long wall linking the two rivers. Though this wall cannot be compared to the Great Wall of China, it stretched for hundreds of miles and passed near present-day Frankfurt. A garrison camp was established here, and the area became a border fortress.\n\nWith the collapse of the Roman Empire, the military camp fell into ruin, gradually became desolate, and was almost forgotten until it revived in the 8th century.\n\nLegend has it that at dawn one day, amidst a dense fog, Charlemagne, having suffered a defeat, fled to the banks of the Main River. Unable to find a guide to cross the river, he was in a perilous situation when he spotted a doe approaching the water's edge. Watching the deer closely, he saw it ford the river, and his army followed, thus turning danger into safety. To commemorate this event, Charlemagne ordered the construction of a city at that location, naming it Frankfurt, meaning 'ford of the Franks'."

EDG_FRNEvents.1.desc:0 "In 794 AD, Frankfurt was first recorded in history as a palatial residence of Charlemagne. Since then, it has consistently been a significant political stage in Germany.\n\nIn 1152, the prince-electors gathered for the first time in Frankfurt to elect Frederick I as Emperor; in 1240, the first Frankfurt Trade Fair was held under a charter granted by Emperor Frederick II; in 1311, Frankfurt officially obtained municipal autonomy; in 1356, Charles IV issued the Golden Bull, formally stipulating that the election of the emperor was to take place in Frankfurt; from 1330 onward, the Frankfurt Trade Fair became an international commercial fair; in 1372, Frankfurt was designated a Free Imperial City, directly under the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nNotably, as Aachen remained under the control of the Carolingian dynasty, Frankfurt also replaced Aachen as the coronation site for Holy Roman Emperors, drawing considerable attention to the city. Consequently, apart from direct armed affiliation with the Hanseatic League, Frankfurt did not form military alliances with any other cities or princes.\n\nSince the 13th century, Frankfurt has been a prosperous commercial city. This was true in the past, remains true in the present, and will continue to be so in the future. However, technological advancements and urban expansion bring not only more opportunities but also introduce increasingly unstable factors..."

EDG_FRNEvents.2.desc:0 "The multitude of guilds within the city has, to some extent, fostered the development of various trades. As a city founded on commerce, Frankfurt has for the most part been controlled by merchant guilds.\n\nHowever, with the growth of handicrafts and the gradual decline of the Hanseatic League, the dominant rule of the merchant guilds in Frankfurt is being challenged. The artisan guilds should have been steadily expanding their influence, yet they continually splinter into various large and small guilds, endlessly disputing among themselves...\n\nBeneath the city's surface prosperity lies unrest. The wheels of wealth along the banks of the Main seem poised to grind to a halt before long, and the winds of change will follow."

EDG_FRNEvents.3.desc:0 "The merchant guild's control over the city has lasted for centuries. In the past, artisans also joined this guild, but with the continuous development of handicrafts, this organization, which was supposed to protect its members' interests, gradually became an obstacle to progress. Consequently, artisans began to break away from the merchant guild and establish new guild organizations.\n\nAlthough the handicrafts are divided into numerous and complex categories, these guilds are generally collectively referred to as artisan guilds. They are all governed by an organization called the Craftsmen's Association, which primarily handles conflicts between the various guilds and serves as an arbitrator. It also plays a role in advocating for the interests of the artisan guilds.\n\nAlthough Frankfurt has a nominal mayor, in practice, all kinds of decisions must be voted on by a council composed of representatives from each guild. Among them, the merchant guild and the artisan guilds, as the two largest guilds in the city, have constantly been trying to weaken each other to secure more benefits for themselves.\n\nPerhaps due to the merchant guild's unsatisfactory track record, the nobility has begun to support the artisan guilds, with the Craftsmen's Association being a prominent example. The Craftsmen's Association was formed by the merger of several guilds within the original city district. After realizing that isolated and specialized development could not compete with other large guilds, the various guilds began to unite in their activities and recently achieved a remarkable feat: the complete renovation of the city's cathedral.\n\nThe Frankfurt Cathedral was initially completed in 1434 by the hands of the Craftsmen's Association. Based on this achievement and after several days of deliberation in the city council, the nobility and some bishops have begun to support the Craftsmen's Association to counterbalance the merchant guild. From now on, the Craftsmen's Association must prove it has the capability to lead Frankfurt toward a brighter future."

Having participated in the design and construction of four projects hailed as miracles, Johann de Bruges has devoted this gift entirely to faith. At this moment, he is directing the construction of a new church.\n\nHe is now drawing the central motif of the rose window—Christ seated on a throne, right hand raised in blessing, left hand holding the orb symbolizing the world. This is the heart of the entire design, the center of light.\n\nThe tip of his pen suddenly trembles. A drop of ink falls onto Christ's face, quickly spreading into an ugly blotch. Johann stares in dismay at the ruined drawing, the fruit of two weeks' work. Weariness washes over him; rubbing his aching eyes, he decides to start anew tomorrow.\n\nThat night, he dreams he is walking inside the unfinished cathedral. Soaring vaults converge overhead; stained glass is yet to be installed, the stone bare, awaiting divine adornment. At the altar's location, he sees a pillar of light descending from the heavens, within which countless wings seem to be beating.\n\nUpon waking, the dream remains vivid. Stranger still, when he unrolls the ink-stained drawing, he finds the blotch is gone. In its place, the center of the paper glows faintly, as if imbued with some heavenly light.\n\nDays pass, construction continues. Johann supervises the work of masons, glaziers, and carpenters. He climbs high on the scaffolding, fingers tracing cold stone carvings, ensuring every seam is perfect. Standing on a gallery a hundred feet above the ground, he sees the faithful filing in, kneeling to pray within the unfinished sanctuary. Their faith is so simple and steadfast, even amidst the surrounding scaffolding and piled construction materials."

He begins to notice how the fundraising clergy demand the last few coins from impoverished peasants; how they promise that more indulgences can ensure a loved one's soul is freed from purgatory. He sees bishops clad in silk robes, fingers adorned with gemstone rings, while outside the church doors, beggars extend empty hands.\n\nWhat stings him most is that afternoon when a peasant woman brings her sick child to the church entrance, begging to see the bishop for a prayer. The guards push her away, fearing her soiled garments might stain the freshly polished marble floors. Johann steps forward to help her but finds he can offer nothing beyond a few coins. The child's hollow eyes haunt him throughout the night.\n\nDoubt descends like a creeping shadow, enveloping his faith. What if this magnificent edifice is only to glorify man, not God? What if behind those beautiful stained glass windows lies only hollow ritual, not true grace?\n\nOn the eve of the rose window's installation day, a storm lashes Chartres. Johann is summoned to the church, as the downpour might endanger the newly installed glass. He hurries through the deserted streets; lightning dances among the church spires, illuminating the stone gargoyles as if they were alive.\n\nInside the cathedral, the vast space is intermittently lit by flashes of lightning. Thunder reverberates through the vaults like the roar of heaven. Johann checks the window's fixings—all is secure. He should leave, but finds himself drawn towards the altar. He kneels, unsure for the first time in years how to pray. Words catch in his throat; his confidence is drowned in doubt. Lightning flashes again, illuminating the entire space, and in that instant, he looks up at the newly installed rose window."

It was not reflected lightning, but radiance emanating from within, more brilliant than the brightest sunlight. The thousands of colored glass pieces seemed ignited by heavenly fire, the patterns coming alive as Christ's visage gazed down upon him with tenderness.\n\nThen, light overflowed from it, coalescing into form.\n\nIt was not the winged humanoid shape described in scriptures, but an entity composed of pure light, as if shaped from the geometric truths of architecture itself—perfect proportions, harmonious angles, a living manifestation of sacred geometry beyond human comprehension. It had no face, yet was filled with an all-knowing gaze; no wings, yet hovered in the air, emanating absolute divine love and majesty.\n\n'Johann.' The light called his name, the voice not traveling through air but resonating directly within his soul.\n\nThe architect knelt on the ground, speechless. Before that radiance, all his achievements, all his doubts, all his pride and shame were simultaneously laid bare. He felt himself as insignificant as the tiniest speck of dust, yet embraced by infinite love.\n\n'Behold,' the light said.\n\nJohann felt his soul being lifted from the ground, or as if the earth itself had fallen away. He was not traversing space, but rather space itself was reorganizing and ascending around him. The scene of his workshop—scattered drawings, tools lightly dusted, the flickering olive oil lamp—dissolved softly like ink washed away by water, vanishing into the boundless, warm, and luminous brilliance.\n\nHe no longer bore the weight of flesh and blood, yet possessed a clearer perception. The angel guiding him now revealed an even more magnificent form, its luminous contours corresponding to the most exquisite mathematical proportions of the universe—a living, flowing sacred geometry. They were not flying, but moving as their will directed. The surrounding 'sights' left Johann, the architect who had built earthly dwellings for God, utterly speechless with awe.\n\nThe architecture of Heaven was not carved from stone but constructed from light, divine law, and pure ideals.\n\nHe saw rivers of light surging beneath his feet, their 'riverbeds' and 'banks' solidified into crystalline structures formed by layered, continuously chanting hymns, resonating with harmony. In the distance, a dome encompassed the four poles, but that dome was not made of static stone or glass—it was rotating nebulae and brilliant galaxies, constrained by an invisible, great will into an immensely grand and orderly arch, its scale rendering the vaults of Chartres Cathedral as insignificant as grains of sand. Each star was a note, collectively playing a silent, magnificent symphony.\n\nThey passed over a bridge spanning a deep, tranquil gorge shimmering with the light of wisdom. The bridge seemed carved from a single massive crystal, yet within it flowed golden, living veins of 'divine law,' resembling leaf veins or the capillary networks of a human body, revealing the fundamental principles that uphold the cosmos—both infinitely sturdy and brimming with the beauty of life."

EDG_FRNEvents.803.desc:0 "Hosts of angels traversed to and fro, their forms diverse: some resembled moving, burning thorn bushes, manifesting divine mysteries; others stood as colossal living pillars composed of countless rotating wheels of light, as if upholding the vault of this realm of ideals. Their flight paths were not chaotic but traced perfect and intricate curves, lingering momentarily in the air to form ephemeral yet eternal aerial corridors and bas-reliefs, narrating every great story since Creation.\n\nWhat most captivated Johann's heart and soul was the omnipresent light. It was not merely illumination; it was itself the material, the structure, and the ornament. Light congealed into tracery as intricately exquisite as snowflakes, casting radiance beyond all colors; light converged into colossal, seemingly weightless pillars, their upward momentum itself becoming towers reaching to the heavens; light flowed downward, 'solidifying' on the ground into 'plazas' and 'staircases' shimmering with a soft glow. There were no shadows here, only a harmonious dance of light at different levels and intensities. Each kind of light embodied an emotion: golden light was all-encompassing love, silver light was lucid wisdom, blue light was profound serenity.\n\nHe finally understood that the proportions, harmony, light, and solidity he had pursued all his life were here manifested in their ultimate, unimaginable form. The earthly cathedral was but a blurred reflection of this eternal blueprint, a faint echo felt deeply yet hard to articulate. They eventually arrived before that gateway.\n\nIt was not set within a wall but stood at the center of a vast plain of light. It was simultaneously composed of two seemingly contradictory states: a massive lightning bolt frozen in an instant, and an eternally standing living crystal. Upon its frame flowed images of all existing and non-existing worlds; what poured forth from within was no longer merely light but tangible, embodied love, peace, and supreme wisdom, its allure sufficient to melt any created soul into it, returning to the ultimate Source.\n\nJohann stood before the summit of this ultimate achievement, this perfect architecture. As an architect, his soul yearned to merge with it, to comprehend that final mystery. Yet, it was precisely this consummate perfection that illuminated his unanticipated attachment to the imperfect world in his heart.\n\nThe magnificent dome of light reminded him of the workers' rough hands carefully lifting stones on the construction site. The bridge solidified from the waters of divine law reminded him of the peasant woman's step toward the church, her eyes still holding a faint, unextinguished hope amidst suffering. The perfectly harmonious symphony of light reminded him of the uneven yet utterly genuine supplications within earthly prayers.\n\nThe earthly church mattered not because it could rival Heaven, but because it could become a door, a window, allowing those in suffering to glimpse a sliver of such radiance, to attain a moment of such peace. True grace was not merely being lifted here to bask in glory. It was to bring back even a trace of this radiance to the dust-filled world, to forge it with one's own hands into forms that could be touched, seen, and felt—not merely structures of stone and glass, but acts of mercy, sincere service, and lives filled with hope. He turned to the angel, his 'being' emitting a soft yet resolute light from this realization, harmoniously resonating with the surrounding heavenly radiance.\n\n'I must return,' Johann's voice was calm yet imbued with an unshakable strength, like the firmest cornerstone. 'My design is not yet complete.'\n\nThe angel's existence, composed of light and wisdom, seemed to convey a profound approval. The entire architecture of Heaven, as if in response to his choice, reverberated with a new, expectant rhythm.\n\nWhen Johann opened his eyes again, he found himself still kneeling before the cathedral's altar. Everything was as before."

FRNDelegationEvents.0.desc:0 "By the 16th century, Frankfurt had already become one of the Empire's most important cities. It was not only the site of imperial elections but also the location of Europe's largest international trade fair. However, its heart—the Römerberg (Roman Square)—still retained a medieval character: muddy and uneven ground, a somewhat disorderly layout of buildings, unworthy of the city's lofty status.\n\nAfter deliberation between the Frankfurt Merchant Guild and the City Hall, it was decided to grant the Craftsmen's Association a profitable project: renovating the central city square. Although the Craftsmen's Association and the Merchant Guild were competitors, this endeavor promised mutual benefit. Thus, with coordination from the City Hall, the two parties collaborated, with the Merchant Guild providing funding and the Craftsmen's Association contributing labor.\n\nThe renovation was initiated by the Frankfurt City Hall, with sponsors including the Merchant Guild and [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]. Each party had its own demands: the City Hall wished to introduce Renaissance aesthetics, replacing some Gothic styles with symmetry, proportion, and classical elements to reflect the city's modernity and civilization; the Merchant Guild sought to enhance commercial functionality, optimize market space, and provide a more dignified and efficient environment for the trade fair; the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] desired that this city, responsible for electing emperors, project the Empire's majesty; and for the Craftsmen's Association, the work had to be crafted with the utmost rigor, aiming to shape the square into a complete work of art.\n\nAccording to the plan, the square's ground was to be completely excavated, removing the original earthen surface and paving it with a massive checkerboard pattern inlaid with Mainz red sandstone and Rhine black basalt. Slightly east of the square's center, a large fountain would be erected as the new visual focal point and a source of drinking water. At the fountain's center, a bronze statue of a female figure holding the Frankfurt city flag and the Imperial orb would symbolize the Goddess of the Main River.\n\nThe building complexes on the eastern and western sides involved too many practical structures, so no large-scale functional adjustments were planned, only renovations to existing infrastructure.\n\nThe row of wooden merchant stalls on the southern side of the square (facing the Main River) would undergo a complete transformation. After demolishing all temporary stalls, a row of two-story stone townhouses would be constructed. The ground floor would feature uniform arched shopfronts, while the second floor would serve as warehouses or residences. All roofs must adopt uniform red-tiled double-pitched roofs, with strictly consistent heights and eaves lines, forming a tidy, aesthetically pleasing, and fire-resistant 'modern' commercial street facade."

FRNDelegationEvents.1.desc:0 "Johannes Wyler, a prominent nobleman from Frankfurt, owed his success to his keen business acumen, becoming a renowned wine merchant in the region. He not only procured wines from Rheingau and the Palatinate but also aspired to own his own vineyards, producing fine wines exclusively for the high-end clientele of his commercial network and his private social circles.\n\nTo this end, through purchases, leases, or contractual partnerships, he consolidated several adjacent small vineyard plots into a single large estate exceeding a hundred hectares, catapulting himself to become Frankfurt's largest wine operator. However, integrating such a vast and fragmented estate required professional builders capable of long-term work, prompting Wyler to contact the Craftsmen's Association to help realize his ambitions.\n\nAddressing Wyler's needs, the Association determined that the architectural complex should be designed as an open production landscape, with central facilities as the core and a road network connecting the various estates.\n\nAt the geographical center of the region, on the most accessible hillside terrace, a Central Estate would be constructed to serve the other estates. This building, designed in the style of a castle, would be a grand, almost fortress-like quadrangular stone complex housing a pressing hall, fermentation rooms, a central cellar, and administrative offices. It would function not only as the centralized processing site for grapes but also as the operational hub managing the entire union. Auxiliary structures outside the core complex would include warehouses, a cooperage, and a carriage dispatch yard, serving all members.\n\nSurrounding this central hub would be dozens of independent estates of varying sizes. These would no longer be fully self-sufficient production units but 'raw material workshops' focused solely on cultivation. Each independent estate would adopt a classic estate layout, comprising a main house (the estate owner's residence), simple sheds (for storing tools, carts, and horses), a basic pressing pool (used only during the busiest harvest season), and perimeter walls (merely low stone walls or hedges delineating property boundaries).\n\nAll planning centered on connectivity: main roads would be 4-meter-wide gravel paths, while branch lanes would be 2-meter-wide dirt or gravel tracks.\n\nThe vineyard layout was designed as a unified terrace system. Red sandstone retaining walls, stretching for kilometers, would transform the slopes into layered terraces, creating a spectacular vista from afar. This system would also effectively prevent soil erosion and facilitate easier cultivation management. Grape varieties were planned according to altitude and microclimate, ensuring each variety thrived in its optimal terroir."

FRNDelegationEvents.2.desc:0 "Frankfurt Cathedral, also known as the Imperial Cathedral, bears this name despite not housing a bishop within its walls. Although the church was previously completed by the Craftsmen's Association, recent devastation from a major fire has rendered it in urgent need of restoration.\n\nCurrently, the church's wooden roof structure is entirely destroyed, parts of the vaults have collapsed, the stonework on the western facade has cracked due to intense heat, and the interior decorations have been reduced to ashes. While the main stone structure remains intact, the cathedral stands as a desolate ruin. As the legally designated site for electing Holy Roman Emperors, its dilapidated state is utterly incongruous with the Empire's dignity. Therefore, the Emperor has decided to fund the cathedral's renovation, aiming to simultaneously reinforce the resilience and timelessness of the traditional Church.\n\nThis plan is far from a mere repair; it is a comprehensive upgrade and reinforcement. First, the roof and vaults will abandon the flammable wooden structure in favor of stone vaulting. The new nave and transept vaults will adopt a sturdier net-vault rib design, offering better load-bearing capacity and a more intricate visual appeal characteristic of late Gothic aesthetics. The new vaults' height will be increased by 5 meters compared to the original, elevating the interior space to a more sublime scale, with the final nave vault reaching 32 meters. The foundations of the existing western tower will undergo extensive reinforcement, embedding deeper and more numerous oak pilings. Granite flying buttresses will be added at key external stress points to counteract the lateral thrust of the vaults. Plans are also made to increase the tower's height from the original 72 meters to 95 meters, making it one of the tallest church towers in the German lands and an indisputable landmark for Frankfurt.\n\nFollowing the restoration and reinforcement, expansionary elements will be added to the church. First, an independent polygonal chapel will be constructed east of the southern transept, dedicated exclusively to the imperial election ceremony. This chapel will employ the then-most fashionable Renaissance style, intentionally creating a dialogue with the Gothic style of the main cathedral, showcasing the progress of the age. At its center will be a large circular marble platform surrounded by seven seats. The dome's fresco will depict the anointing of King David from the Old Testament.\n\nThe interior decorations and furnishings of the main cathedral will be completely reconfigured. The main altar will be commissioned from a master in Antwerp to carve The Last Judgment in oak. Twelve side altars will be installed along the side aisles. The stained-glass windows will no longer narrate biblical stories but instead depict the coronation scenes of successive German kings and emperors. A massive bell weighing 11 tons will be cast for the rebuilt western tower; its toll will announce the most critical imperial moments, such as the death of an emperor or the election of a new one.\n\nUpon completion, this cathedral, blending Gothic structure with Renaissance elements, will stand as an imperial monument of both sacred and political significance."

FRNDelegationEvents.3.desc:0 "Mainz Cathedral, also known as St. Martin's Cathedral in Mainz, serves as the seat of the Archbishop of Mainz. This Romanesque structure, begun nearly 500 years ago, is showing signs of age: cracks have appeared in some vaults, the northwest tower leans noticeably due to unstable foundations, the ancient wooden roof structure poses a fire hazard, and the interior has become dim and dilapidated after multiple fires.\n\nThe Archbishop of Mainz wishes the Craftsmen's Association to undertake restoration and reinforcement of the cathedral, while also updating its interior to keep pace with the Renaissance. According to the requirements, this project aims to strengthen the structure, eliminate hazards, and moderately refresh the interior decoration.\n\nOn the north side of the cathedral (facing the Rhine) and its eastern end, six massive granite flying buttresses will be added to counteract the lateral thrust of the main vaults and reinforce the walls. These buttresses are designed to be exceptionally robust and powerful, topped with pinnacles, making them both practical and visually imposing, like the cathedral's sturdy outstretched arms.\n\nThe leaning northwest tower is the technical core of the project. Engineers have decided to freeze the tower's current tilt and prevent further deterioration. Dozens of oak pilings will be driven into the ground on the opposite side of the lean (southeast), upon which a massive granite counterweight foundation will be constructed, acting like an anchor to firmly hold the leaning tower. Ultimately, the tower will be stabilized at a position 1.8 meters off the vertical axis, with this 'imperfection' serving as proof of engineering prowess.\n\nTo prevent future cathedral fires, the wooden roof structures over the choir and transepts will be replaced with stone vaulting. Simultaneously, several concealed ventilation openings will be carved into the drum and high points of the side aisles to improve internal air circulation and protect frescoes and fabrics from dampness.\n\nFinally, interior adjustments will focus primarily on establishing new altar groupings and constructing a throne. Some medieval side altars will be removed and replaced with a set of seven new marble altars. A brand new marble throne will be built for the archbishop, positioned in the center of the choir, backed against a massive pier.\n\nThis cathedral is poised to embrace a future that is more solid, brighter, and brimming with confidence, casting off the dimness and antiquation of the past."

FRNDelegationEvents.4.desc:0 "Rebuilding the Library of Alexandria has long been an ideal for successive rulers of the city, yet this plan has consistently stalled due to funding and technical constraints, with no concrete proposals materializing.\n\nRecently, the Italian division submitted a construction plan for a new Alexandrian library, funded by the Governor of Alexandria. It proposes building in an area close to, but not precisely on, the ancient library's original site. This project is not a simple reconstruction of an ancient Greek institution but aims to create a new center of knowledge within the Islamic tradition of the 'House of Wisdom'.\n\nConsidering potential religious conflicts, it was decided that the Italian division would provide engineers while recruiting local personnel in Alexandria. According to the plan, the entire complex is a nearly square, enclosed structure with high limestone outer walls and multiple, clearly delineated courtyards inside, measuring approximately 120 meters in length and 100 meters in width. It utilizes a combination of courtyards, wind towers, and clerestory windows to form an efficient passive ventilation and cooling system, addressing Alexandria's hot climate. The foundations are raised above ground level, with an empty space beneath the library floor, and the walls are exceptionally thick to resist Mediterranean humidity.\n\nThe core of the complex is the Central Great Library, a vast rectangular hall 50 meters long and 25 meters wide. Its roof is composed of a series of domes rather than a single massive one, making it structurally safer and easier to realize. Inside, two rows of massive stone columns support 18 smaller domes, each creating an independent 'study carrel' beneath. The walls are lined with wooden bookshelves embedded up to 5 meters high, equipped with movable ladders. Each study carrel has a fixed writing desk and low shelves for frequently used reference books. The floor is paved with marble, cool in summer. Underground ventilation ducts channel breezes from the Mediterranean into the interior for natural cooling.\n\nImmediately north and south of the library, two-story wings house the Translation and Scriptorium. Dozens of scholars proficient in multiple languages work here, divided into Greek, Latin, Persian, and other departments. Each room features large arched windows facing the courtyards, providing ample light. Outside the rooms are wide balconies for scholars to rest and converse.\n\nIn the southwestern corner of the complex, a circular tower houses the Observatory, honoring Alexandria's ancient astronomical tradition. The tower is approximately 35 meters tall with four stories. The top open-air platform holds large bronze astronomical instruments like quadrants and astrolabes, while the lower floors are used for calculations and record-keeping.\n\nOn the eastern side of the complex, buildings for the Academy and residential quarters are situated. This includes an Islamic madrasa teaching theology, law, philosophy, medicine, and mathematics, along with dormitories providing accommodation for about 50 senior scholars and students, forming an academic community.\n\nThis 'House of Wisdom' will become a brilliant cultural beacon under the Empire, symbolizing the transmission and exchange of knowledge across religious and ethnic boundaries, serving as a sturdy bridge connecting the legacy of ancient Alexandria with the late Renaissance world."

The construction process was exceedingly slow, beginning in 1305 and only completing the main dome in 1437, after which progress stalled indefinitely, leaving it unfinished.\n\nIt was not until recently that local monastic orders organized fundraising, supplemented by donations from merchants along the trade routes, that the construction plan for the church was revived, with the Italian division tasked with completing the project.\n\nThe initial architectural style was Gothic, but to emphasize its universality and inclusiveness, subsequent plans aim to blend the solidity of late Romanesque structures with the verticality of early Gothic lines, incorporating strong local influences due to its North African location. The church is modestly sized but stands out due to its unique position and pure white color scheme. The floor plan follows a classic Latin cross layout but is simplified. Due to material constraints, the initially planned polished stucco finish was abandoned in favor of locally quarried white travertine marble. The stone surfaces are left unrefined, presenting a rough yet dazzling texture in sunlight, creating an overall impression of purity, solemnity, and solidity, tinged with a monumental sense of sorrow.\n\nThe interior hall remains as originally planned, with construction proceeding on the existing foundations. The hall is 24 meters wide and 67 meters long, with the central vault reaching 20 meters at its highest point. The nave is 10 meters wide, covered by a barrel vault supported by robust transverse pointed arches. The side aisles are each 7 meters wide, with lower quadripartite vaulted ceilings. The piers are composite in form, very simple: a square core with attached semicircular shafts to receive the vault ribs, devoid of intricate carvings. To accommodate North Africa's hot climate, the interior lighting relies on tall, narrow clerestory windows fitted with adjustable alabaster panels instead of fully transparent glass, creating a soft, diffuse, and cool light that fosters a hazy and sacred atmosphere.\n\nThe transepts project slightly, matching the total width of the nave and extending 10 meters deep. Above the crossing of the nave and transepts is a simple dome supported by four massive pendentives, painted internally with an image of the Lamb of God. The apse is semicircular, 8 meters deep, featuring a semi-dome. The west facade and its twin towers are the church's most distinctive features. The west facade is extremely austere, with almost no sculptural decoration, featuring only a large rose window (symbolizing fate and the eye of God) and the main entrance below it. The twin towers, as originally planned, are square, each 57 meters tall with sides of 6 meters. At approximately 40 meters, they transition into octagonal spires, but their cores are hollowed out to contain spiral staircases leading to belfries. One tower houses a bell, while the other features a perpetually lit beacon at its summit.\n\nFinancial constraints resulted in a very simple interior decor. The interior, like the exterior, is predominantly pure white, with light grey marble flooring. After consultation with the bishop, the Craftsmen's Association added a touch of color at no cost: frescoes related to the Children's Crusade were designed for the apse's semi-dome and a few stained-glass windows. These frescoes are executed in a Byzantine style, using deep blue, ochre, and vermilion on a gold background, creating a strong visual and emotional focus against the white setting.\n\nThe church commemorates not just a military victory but serves as an inspiration for 'spiritual expeditions.' The twin towers rise like two swords piercing the sky, yet their white hue also resembles giant candles, perpetually praying for lost souls."

FRNDelegationEvents.6.name:0 "Restoration: The Unrotting Timber"
FRNDelegationEvents.6.desc:0 "The Church of the Holy Spirit Hospital in Lübeck, built in the 13th century, serves more as a hospital than a church in function. While its structure is brick Gothic, its interior extensively utilizes wood, which has now necessitated urgent maintenance and renovation.\n\nIn light of this, the Mayor and Bishop of Lübeck have extended an invitation to the Craftsmen's Association, entrusting them with the restoration of this over-300-year-old church. The requirement is to preserve the wooden structure, so the project has been assigned to a master proficient in Nordic timber-frame architecture, Kaspar Vogt.\n\nThis structure, originating from the 13th century, has seen over 300 years of use. Its massive wooden hall exhibits issues in its primary wooden components—particularly the roof trusses and load-bearing columns—such as wood fatigue, local warping, and loosened mortise-and-tenon joints, posing safety hazards. The large open wards from the medieval period, used to house patients, are no longer suitable. There is a need to provide more private and comfortable living environments for elderly residents while retaining the core function as a chapel. The all-wooden structure has poor fire resistance, necessitating certain fire prevention measures.\n\nThe church's dimensions will remain unchanged after renovation, maintaining its original length of 30 meters, width of 12 meters, and a nave height of approximately 10 meters. The church's most defining feature is the two rows of tall wooden columns dividing the space into a central nave and two side aisles, with galleries above the aisles serving as patient wards.\n\nVogt's first priority is to conduct a thorough inspection of all 700-plus primary wooden components, numbering them with ink lines and recording their condition. For load-bearing columns with rotten bases, the 'stump splicing' technique will be used: sawing off the decayed section and connecting a new piece of oak of the same material with complex mortise-and-tenon joints, reinforced externally with iron bands, ensuring both strength and aesthetics. Slightly warped beams will be corrected and secured using large screw clamps. Within the original Gothic roof trusses, an auxiliary set of diagonal braces and tie rods will be invisibly added to form a more stable triangular structural system without altering the external profile. Finally, the masonry foundations will be checked for settlement and partially repaired to ensure a stable 'base' for the wooden structure.\n\nThe ward renovation aims to enhance the church's medical services. The open gallery spaces above the side aisles will be partitioned into a series of small compartments using finely crafted oak panels. Each compartment measures approximately 2.2 meters (depth) by 2.5 meters (width), containing a bed, a small storage cabinet, and a window opening inward. The partition height is about 2.1 meters, leaving space above to maintain the continuity of the hall's grand volume. A small spiral stair tower will be added to the northeast exterior corner, providing direct access to the second-floor gallery, replacing the original awkward wooden staircase and improving vertical circulation.\n\nThe interior decoration involves cleaning and retouching the painted panels of the nave's famous wooden ceiling. Painters will be commissioned to repaint the panels depicting saints and angels based on medieval patterns, restoring their splendor. The color palette will maintain the wood's original warm tones; all new timber will be left unpainted, protected only with tung oil to allow it to blend with the aged wood over time. Behind all kitchen and fireplace areas, stone or brick layers will be discreetly installed. Strict fire usage regulations will be enforced, with additional large water buckets and sandboxes provided for fire prevention.\n\nThe new compartments and stair tower added under Vogt's plan are like new threads woven into old brocade—harmonious and practical. The renovated church will continue to offer shelter to Lübeck's poor and sick in its warm, grand, and serene manner."

FRNDelegationEvents.7.name:0 "Vision: The Lakeside Stage"
FRNDelegationEvents.7.desc:0 "The Elector of Overijssel has long been adept at maneuvering among the various powers within the Empire through deft diplomacy. However, growing diplomatic demands have gradually rendered traditional court politics inadequate. Following the establishment of a dedicated foreign affairs department, the concept of a 'stage' specifically built for diplomacy has emerged.\n\n[H04.Monarch.GetTitle] [H04.Monarch.GetName] has recently commissioned the Craftsmen's Association to construct a palace by the Isselmeer as a 'stage' for the foreign affairs department. According to the requirements, the palace complex will blend Renaissance symmetry with Dutch pragmatism and defensive needs.\n\nThe entire palace complex adopts a U-shaped layout, opening towards the Isselmeer, embracing the lake views and welcoming guests arriving by sea. The palace covers an area approximately 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. A low red-brick wall surrounds the peninsula, defining the domain without appearing enclosed. A decorative gatehouse marks the main entrance.\n\nThe main body of the U-shaped structure features slightly projecting east and west wings. The facade is 80 meters wide and 20 meters deep, standing three stories high with a roof peak at 28 meters. The primary building material is Dutch red brick, extensively complemented by white sandstone for window frames, cornerstones, horizontal decorative bands, and sculptures, creating a striking color contrast characteristic of the Dutch Renaissance style. The roof is a steep double-pitched design covered with dark grey slate tiles, featuring numerous dormer windows to provide light for attic spaces.\n\nThe palace is divided into three sections: the Central Wing, West Wing, and East Wing. The Central Wing houses ceremonial and conference areas, its core being the diplomatic hall named the Hall of Mirrors. It measures 30 meters long, 12 meters wide, and 8 meters high. One side features five large arched windows directly facing the lake, while the opposite side is lined with five massive Venetian mirrors, multiplying the light and lake views to create an illusion of infinite openness. This space is intended for grand banquets, balls, and signing ceremonies. Adjacent to the Hall of Mirrors is a Negotiation Chamber designed for formal meetings, measuring 12 by 10 meters with exceptional soundproofing.\n\nThe West Wing consists of Ambassadorial Residences, comprising twelve luxurious suites, each for a foreign delegation. Each suite, approximately 80 square meters, includes a living room, bedroom, servant's quarters, and an independent fireplace. The East Wing is designated for domestic administrative offices. As requested, its construction is temporarily deferred; it will be planned later, following [H04.Monarch.GetName]'s arrangements to relocate capital office facilities into it.\n\nThe most unique feature of the palace is its Watergate. A grand aquatic entrance is constructed at the center of the U-shaped building, with a channel 8 meters wide and an arch 6 meters high. Ambassadors from various nations can sail directly from the Isselmeer into the palace's central courtyard, where they are received at the disembarkation point. The Central Courtyard, measuring 40 by 30 meters, is designed as a formal, symmetrically patterned Dutch garden with neatly trimmed hedges, fountains, and gravel paths, serving as an ideal venue for informal meetings among ambassadors.\n\nThis structure will provide the Elector of Overijssel with an unparalleled, efficient, and memorable tool for diplomatic maneuvering. It stands as both a symbol of national power and a precisely functioning diplomatic apparatus."

FRNDelegationEvents.8.name:0 "Expansion: The Royal Wing"
FRNDelegationEvents.8.desc:0 "Notre-Dame de Paris, formally known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Paris, was begun in 1163 under the initiative of Maurice de Sully, the Bishop of Paris. The entire cathedral was completed in 1345, taking over 180 years, and stands as one of the oldest and most symbolic monuments in the French capital.\n\nAmidst France's centralization movement and coinciding with the height of the French Renaissance, the French royal court became deeply enamored with Italian Renaissance culture. Adding a Renaissance-style 'wing' to the Gothic masterpiece presented an excellent opportunity to proclaim the dynasty's taste, authority, and modernity. Therefore, [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] decided to construct a private, opulent chapel and sacristy within the Gothic Notre-Dame, matching the status of the French monarchy. The King required a space near the cathedral for conducting private Masses and storing precious liturgical objects donated by the royal family. This move aimed to visually reinforce the concept that 'Notre-Dame is the royal church of France,' binding it more closely to the monarchy.\n\nThis commission will be handled by the French division. Unlike previous restorations, the core of this plan is to add a new functional wing—independent yet connected to the main structure—on the south side of Notre-Dame (facing the Seine) without altering the cathedral's primary fabric. The chief engineer is a French architect profoundly influenced by the Italian Renaissance, Philibert Delorme.\n\nThe new structure, named the Royal Wing, will be built closely against the eastern end of Notre-Dame's southern transept and choir, utilizing the open space between the cathedral and the Seine. It will be a two-story, L-shaped structure, with the upper floor housing the Royal Chapel and the lower floor containing the new Sacristy. The Royal Wing will connect to the cathedral interior via an arched passageway opened in the southern wall of the transept.\n\nThe new construction will fully adopt the latest Renaissance style, creating an intentional and harmonious dialogue with Notre-Dame's Gothic architecture. The primary building material will be cream-colored travertine stone, offering a subtle contrast to the cathedral's grey stone. The facade will follow rigorous classical proportions, featuring large arched windows instead of Gothic pointed arches, with pilasters and pediments adorning the spaces between windows. Above the Royal Chapel will rise a large elliptical dome covered in lead, becoming a new landmark along the Seine. Sculptural themes will shift from biblical narratives to royal coats of arms, mythological figures, trophies, and Greek key patterns.\n\nThe Royal Chapel will be a nearly square space, approximately 20 by 18 meters, with an internal dome height of 40 meters. The interior will be bright and resplendent, resembling a jewel box. Walls will be covered from floor to spandrel with large frescoes and marble inlays. A ring of circular windows at the dome's base will allow daylight to pour in, illuminating the frescoes. The eastern end will feature a marble altar, backed by a large stained-glass window depicting an allegorical scene of 'Christ Entrusting the Keys of Heaven to the King of France.' A gallery, reserved for royal family members, will connect via a discreet corridor to the choir stalls.\n\nThe new Sacristy will share the same footprint as the upper chapel but with a lower ceiling height of 6 meters. It will store precious relics, vestments, and gold and silver vessels donated by the royal family, featuring rows of locked oak cabinets and a large safe. The overall design and decoration will be relatively austere but functional, with good ventilation and moisture-proofing.\n\nUpon completion, the silhouette of Notre-Dame as viewed from the Seine will be transformed: upon its Gothic skeleton, an elegant Renaissance dome will rise. It symbolizes the French monarchy embracing classical revival while remaining rooted in the Catholic tradition since the Middle Ages. This expansion does not diminish Notre-Dame's greatness but adds a profound new layer to its history, serving as an eternal testament to one era attempting to dialogue with and surpass another."

FRNDelegationEvents.9.name:0 "Restoration: The New Canon of Mountain and Sea"
FRNDelegationEvents.9.desc:0 "Mont Saint-Michel is a renowned French monument and Catholic pilgrimage site. The island is conical, with a circumference of 900 meters, formed of towering granite, and stands 88 meters above sea level.\n\nIn the 8th century, Cardinal Aubert built a small chapel on the island's highest point. Between 1211 and 1228, six buildings centered around the Merveille Abbey were constructed on the northern part of the island, followed by sections of walls and Gothic abbey enclosures from the 13th to 15th centuries.\n\nSuch an extended construction period meant that the erection of new structures and the maintenance of older ones proceeded simultaneously, increasing the difficulty of later constructions. By the mid-15th century, the Romanesque choir of the main church had partially collapsed. Technical and financial constraints stalled restoration efforts until recently, when the Craftsmen's Association was commissioned to address this issue.\n\nInvestigations by the French division revealed that while the Romanesque choir at the eastern end of the church had undergone repairs, its fundamental structural problems—unstable foundations and outward-leaning walls—were never fully resolved and have since accelerated, with widening cracks and falling stones from some vaults. The project is assigned to the French division, with chief engineer Luca Leblanc, a French architect trained in Italy. The plan is to skillfully graft the order, symmetry, and decorative aesthetics of the Renaissance onto Gothic structural logic, creating a distinct French style.\n\nThe new choir will not be purely Gothic but an innovative 'Renaissance Gothic.' The new design retains the Gothic flying buttress system and ribbed vaults, as these represent the most reliable engineering for countering lateral thrust and achieving grand interior spaces. Dimensions will follow the original site: 25 meters long, 20 meters wide, and 28 meters high. Structural materials will still use granite from the Chausey Islands, but decorative interior elements (such as pilasters and window frames) will employ white Carrara marble imported from Italy, creating a contrast in color and texture. The fresco program will involve commissioning Italian Mannerist painters to create interior frescoes and altarpieces for the new choir, bringing the Fontainebleau School's style to the Normandy coast.\n\nExternally, the buttress plinths will be designed as Renaissance-style niches housing statues of saints. The buttresses themselves will be carved with classical motifs like Greek key patterns and garlands. The large windows will maintain their pointed arches, but the tracery patterns will shift from the intricate Flamboyant style to more symmetrical, geometric Renaissance designs, even incorporating round-arched elements. The vault ribs will no longer be simple moldings but carved to resemble trompe-l'œil coffered panels. The walls will no longer be bare stone but will feature a series of large pilasters and cornices to organize the space, impart a classical sense of order, and provide perfect framing for future frescoes and tapestries. Capitals will abandon leaf and monster carvings in favor of Corinthian designs.\n\nAdditionally, the commission requires a thorough inspection and reinforcement of the entire complex. Large iron tie-rods and anchor bolts will be discreetly embedded within walls to secure fragile sections. Gun emplacements will be added at strategic points, their designs cleverly integrated into the architectural silhouette, ensuring utility without compromising aesthetic unity."

FRNDelegationEvents.10.name:0 "Project: The Vision of the New Rome"
FRNDelegationEvents.10.desc:0 "The Italian Renaissance profoundly influenced French artistic schools. [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] was determined to create a cultural center on French soil that could rival, even surpass, the Renaissance courts of Italy. The Palace of Fontainebleau, his beloved hunting lodge, was chosen as the ideal canvas. The core idea was not to replicate ancient Roman architecture, but to infuse the artistic soul of the Italian Renaissance into the architectural body of French Gothic, creating a new, distinctly French courtly art style—the renowned 'School of Fontainebleau.'\n\nThis renovation project was led by two Italian Mannerist masters, Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio, with construction executed by the French division. The plan did not involve demolition and rebuilding; instead, it centered on the original medieval château, radically transforming its appearance and function by adding new wings, courtyards, and interior decorations.\n\nThe entire expansion was organized around a series of courtyards: The Cour du Cheval Blanc, originally an irregular medieval courtyard, was redesigned into a vast, solemn rectangular courtyard, serving as the palace's new main entrance and venue for grand ceremonies, unified by new building facades on the east, north, and west sides; The Cour de la Fontaine, located to the south overlooking a large pond, was planned as the King's private living quarters, offering a more beautiful and tranquil environment; The Cour Ovale retained the oldest medieval core but saw its internal facades remodeled in the Renaissance style.\n\nThe new wing facades were relatively restrained, using warm local sandstone and brick. Innovation focused on large floor-to-ceiling windows (replacing Gothic small windows) and flat or low-pitched roofs (concealed behind Italianate parapets), with overall contours tending towards horizontality, contrasting with the medieval vertical Gothic style. Inside, Rosso and Primaticcio created an integrated decorative system combining frescoes, stucco reliefs, and wood paneling.\n\nThe wings comprised the Gallery and the Porte Dorée. The Gallery was the first and most important element of the project: a 60-meter-long, 6-meter-wide, 7-meter-high corridor connecting the King's private apartments with the Chapel of the Trinity, serving as a promenade art gallery for walks, conversations, and displaying the King's art collection. The Porte Dorée, a magnificent entrance on the east wing of the Cour du Cheval Blanc, was designed to resemble an ancient Roman triumphal arch but adorned with Renaissance reliefs, statues, and royal heraldic symbols.\n\nInterior decoration formed the most crucial part of the plan. In the Gallery, the lower half of the walls featured high-quality walnut paneling with exquisite carvings. The upper half was covered with large frescoes designed by Rosso, with themes from classical mythology and allegories aimed at praising the King's wisdom and virtue. Between the frescoes and wood paneling were high-relief stucco sculptures (led by Primaticcio), depicting cornucopias, garlands, figures, and royal emblems. Parts of these stucco decorations were gilded, shimmering with opulence in the light from the windows. This three-dimensional combination of 'fresco-stucco-wood carving' created an exceptionally rich, luxurious, and visually stimulating effect, entirely distinct from Italy's pure fresco tradition.\n\nThe Fontainebleau expansion project held significance far beyond architecture itself. It did not seek the greatest size or the tallest towers but pursued the most avant-garde, luxurious artistic style and the highest level of cultural symbolism. By introducing Italian masters and granting them great creative freedom, it elevated French court culture to a top European standard while forging a new, profoundly influential international style—the 'School of Fontainebleau'—transforming the Palace of Fontainebleau from a medieval castle into Europe's first true Renaissance palace."

FRNDelegationEvents.100.desc:0 "The Basilica of the Holy Trinity and the Divine Dome, also known as the Most Holy Basilica of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, and the Divine Order (Basilica Santissima Trinità del Divino Ordine), was the grand vision of one of the most ambitious and formidable popes of the Renaissance—Julius II. He was not only a spiritual leader but also a great patron of the arts and a statesman, hailed as the 'Warrior Pope.' His dream was to rebuild Rome as the capital of Christendom, surpassing the ancient empires.\n\nThe construction of the Basilica of the Holy Trinity was a cornerstone of this grand vision. It was intended to manifest the supreme glory and authority of the Catholic Church, renewed by the Renaissance. Julius II aimed for this edifice to become the ultimate symbol of Catholic confidence, unity, and prosperity before the Council of Trent—a church 'to end all churches' in scale, aesthetics, and theological depth. It was the most magnificent interpretation of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, designed to visually immerse every believer in the divine order, harmony, and perfection.\n\nThe overall design and layout of the church represent the pinnacle of ideal Renaissance architecture. Its core design principle is a centralized plan, using perfectly symmetrical geometric forms to symbolize divine order, harmony, and perfection. The entire complex is a vast yet lucid system, intended to guide the faithful through a spatial experience of the Trinity doctrine.\n\nThe complex consists of the Main Sanctuary, the Three Towers, the Circular Colonnaded Plaza, and the Papal Ceremonial Palace. It spans 450 meters in length and 350 meters in width, with a planned maximum height of 150 meters.\n\nThe main body of the Sanctuary adopts a Greek cross plan, meaning all four arms are of equal length. Unlike the Latin cross, it lacks a pronounced longitudinal direction, emphasizing centrality, stability, and universality—each direction is equally important, metaphorically representing the distinct yet consubstantial, co-equal, and co-eternal persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Above the central crossing point soars the great dome, the absolute core and visual focus of the entire structure.\n\nThe dome rests upon a 50x50-meter square crossing, transitioning to a circular form via a massive drum. Its internal diameter exceeds that of the Pantheon at 44 meters. The interior apex of the dome reaches 120 meters, while the external height is 150 meters. If completed, it would stand as Rome's absolute zenith for centuries, visible from every angle as the 'crown of faith.'\n\nThe western facade serves as the main entrance, its most striking feature being the three colossal towers. The towers (135 meters) are slightly lower than the main dome (150 meters), accentuating the dome's centrality while forming a powerful entrance sequence with the triad of towers. The plaza is trapezoidal in design, intended to funnel visitors' gaze towards the main sanctuary.\n\nThis plan depicts not merely a building but a declaration in stone—a manifesto of mathematics, theology, and power."

FRNDelegationEvents.200.name:0 "Wonder: The Church of the Unified Holy Spirit"
FRNDelegationEvents.200.desc:0 "The advent of the Reformation gave rise to a multitude of theological currents across the German lands. Beyond conflict and persecution, there were still those who hoped to bridge the divides and find an ideal ground for peace. Notably, this church was not funded by a single individual or organization; it was financed by contributions from numerous merchants, clergy, and members of various social strata across Germany and beyond, truly a collective endeavor.\n\nThe Church of the Unified Holy Spirit is not a traditional church but a 'Place of Dialogue.' Its core idea is that beyond sectarian divisions, there exists a universal space guided by the Holy Spirit, dedicated to the pursuit of truth and love. It does not host regular Masses for any single denomination but serves for inter-confessional theological debates, ecumenical prayer gatherings, coordination of charitable works, and open meditation and reflection for all Christians, indeed for all seekers of truth.\n\nThe architecture completely departs from traditional Latin or Greek cross plans, adopting a perfect circle, symbolizing harmony, unity, and God's eternity without beginning or end. The immense central dome is inwardly concave, forming a vast oculus open to the sky. Above it, there is no conventional roof or spire; instead, an extremely lightweight, nearly ethereal structure of glass and steel encloses the space, ensuring rain and weather can enter the atrium to a degree. This symbolizes a perpetual openness to divine mystery, unenclosed by any man-made doctrine. Sunlight, moonlight, starlight, or rain falls directly through this 'eye' into a central pool in the hall, signifying that God's grace, truth, and the water of life shine upon and nourish all without exception.\n\nSurrounding the circular hall are three concentric ambulatories. The innermost wall is smooth and white, devoid of any images or sculptures, meant only to reflect the celestial light from the center, providing a minimalist space for meditation. The middle ambulatory is called the 'Wall of Paths.' Here, interpretive texts and artistic expressions of the Lord's Prayer from Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and even Greek Orthodoxy (via trade links through Venice and Frankfurt) are displayed side by side. The outermost ambulatory is practical, housing studies, conference rooms, and quiet alcoves for travelers to rest.\n\nAt the very center of the hall lies a simple circular pool of black marble named the 'Fountain of Life.' Its bed is paved with pebbles from the Rhine River. Water falling from above collects here; visitors may sit beside it or touch the water, symbolizing that before the source of life, all are equal pilgrims.\n\nThe windows around the building are specially crafted 'unfinished windows.' The glass is etched with sketches of various geometric patterns, as if the master's design remains incomplete. This signifies that human understanding of the divine is perpetually 'in progress,' requiring constant dialogue, learning, and growth, never to be complacent or closed.\n\nWithin the hall stands a simple stone pulpit, often left empty. It is used for important public readings or to chair debates but resists becoming the permanent rostrum of any single authority. Above the grand entrance, a lintel bears the same maxim inscribed in three languages: Latin, German, and Hebrew."

To eternally commemorate this 'divine miracle' and to permanently reaffirm, both geographically and spiritually, Catholic ownership of the Holy City, Pope Paul III has ordered the construction of this epic edifice. It is not merely a church; it is a victory monument, a military outpost, and a missionary center.\n\nIts location was carefully chosen, situated immediately adjacent to the traditional Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This is intended to visually and symbolically 'overshadow' or even 'supplant' the older, somewhat antiquated structures left by Byzantine and Crusader forebears, proclaiming the arrival of a new, Catholic era.\n\nThe building is 120 meters long and 60 meters wide, with its central dome reaching an external height of 100 meters, making it the absolute highest point in the Old City of Jerusalem, visible for miles and visually dominating the city. The primary stone is Jerusalem's distinctive white Mizzi Hi limestone, matching the city's palette. The overall structure follows a Latin cross plan, but the nave is exceptionally wide, capable of accommodating troops in times of war. The vaults of the side aisles are designed to be extremely sturdy, serving as warehouses and barracks.\n\nThe west facade mimics a Roman triumphal arch but is grander and more austere, featuring a 10-meter-tall bronze statue of Saint Michael the Archangel at its center. The two bell towers also function as watchtowers, containing spiral ramps for rapid ascent to their summits. The church's crypt is vast, serving not only to house relics but also as a fortified shelter and armory, with a secret aqueduct leading outside the city walls. The nave, 40 meters high, creates an overwhelming sense of awe. The choir, located at the eastern end, is designed with a crypt beneath it deliberately styled as the terminus of the Via Dolorosa, proclaiming this to be the true 'New Sepulchre'—the redemption achieved through military conquest and orthodox Catholic faith."

FRNDelegationEvents.400.desc:0 "In the 16th century, Riga was a vital member of the Hanseatic League—a prosperous yet tense metropolis where Latin and local cultures intertwined, Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Orthodoxy coexisted, and merchants, nobles, artisans, and scholars lived side by side. Concurrently, the currents of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed here.\n\nThe concept of the 'Universal City' was born amidst this complex background. It was not initiated by a single denomination but promoted by a group of Riga's elites influenced by Renaissance humanism. Their goal was not to construct a single church or palace, but to plan an entire community—a miniature 'ideal state.' Its core philosophy was to recreate, within a meticulously designed space, the 'harmonious coexistence between humanity and God, humanity and nature, and among people themselves' as symbolized by the Garden of Eden, using the harmonious arrangement of architecture, art, and nature to counteract external chaos and division.\n\nThe Universal City is not a single building but a rectangular planned area covering approximately 20 hectares. The entire zone employs strict geometric symmetry, with a primary east-west central axis along which all significant buildings are distributed, symbolizing the journey from the secular to the sacred.\n\nThe western entrance zone connects to the Plaza of the Tree of Life. At the plaza's center stands a massive oak tree. The ground is paved with a giant labyrinth pattern in black and white cobblestones, all paths eventually leading eastward towards the center. The plaza is surrounded by arcaded loggias housing merchant stalls from around the world. A straight, artificially excavated canal runs north-south, dividing the Universal City into the 'Secular Garden' in the west and the 'Sacred Sanctuary' in the east.\n\nThe spiritual heart of the Universal City is the Cathedral of Harmony. It is not a traditional church but takes the shape of a triangle, with three identical facades facing due east, northwest, and northeast, symbolizing the Holy Trinity and an openness to the world in all directions. Instead of conventional bell towers, each corner of the triangular roof features a small open belfry housing a bronze bell with a distinct tone. The bells are used solely to summon people for public discourse or silent reflection, not to assert ecclesiastical authority. Inside, there is no altar. The center is a circular void directly beneath a vast glass dome overhead. Below it lies the 'Fountain of the World,' whose waters are channeled via underground pipes into the canal and beyond. Here, light and water converge, symbolizing that divine grace is universal, flowing, and formless.\n\nAdditionally, the design includes a series of courtyards and other structures modeled after the ideal Eden. Although there was once debate about constructing a densely built, hive-like 'spire city,' the idea was ultimately rejected, and the design was successfully submitted to us. Now, the next steps are clear."
