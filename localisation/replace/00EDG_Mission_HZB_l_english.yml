EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_3_desc:0 "The Qizil Qoyunlu tribe, claiming descent from the Seljuks, initially obeyed the Jalayirids who held Baghdad as the khanate crumbled, then treacherously overthrew their employer of different faith and established their own Nestorian kingdom in Baghdad. Betrayal is always the most disgraceful act. Let us destroy this Turkmen dynasty, return to Mesopotamia, and restore the great city of Harun al-Rashid."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_4_title:0 "The Lost Nestorians"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_4_desc:0 "At the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410, the Mesopotamian Christian Church, supported by Sassanid Emperor Yazdegerd I, severed all ties with the Western Church. Yet, Eastern Christians did not become rootless flowers blooming in Persia. These self-styled 'Assyrian' heretics settled in the Iranian lands for a millennium until the Ilkhanate fell into disaster. When Muzaffarid governor enacted harsh religious policies, a significant number of Nestorians fled to the heartland of the ancient Persian Empire—the Fars region—and eventually established the Nestorian Sargu Kingdom during the Muzaffarid internal strife. Their history is indeed moving, but soon they themselves will be nothing more than a historical footnote."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_6_desc:0 "The Levantines first broke free from Mamluk rule, and now they have betrayed the Sahada dynasty. How long do these petty men think they can roam free? The Levant being ruled by forces other than us is an insult to the humiliation our Mongol ancestors suffered there. We shall avenge our forebears and bring the prosperous cities of the Sham under our dominion."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_7_desc:0 "In the past, the newly formed Mamluk Sultanate repelled our first invasion of Egypt at the Battle of Ain Jalut. This humiliation has lingered hauntingly in our hearts. Today, the Mamluks are troubled by religious issues, no longer as valiant as they were in Baybars' time, while the Khanate is stronger than ever before. We shall return and launch a war of vengeance against the Mamluks."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_8_desc:0 "The Mongol Great Yassa is undoubtedly the fundamental law and tradition of the Khanate, though it has dissatisfied many ulama and civil officials, granting the military significant power in administrative affairs.

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_11_title:0 "Shadow of Allah on Earth"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_11_desc:0 "The Caliph is the designated successor of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) after his ascension, the common leader of all Islamic nations. However, after the era of the Rashidun Caliphs, this throne has been shrouded in shadow. The prolonged struggles among the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid dynasties have diluted its sanctity. Although we were once the steppe's horselords, since Ghazan Khan, we have become devout Muslims. It is our duty to defend the Caliph—whether Abbasid or Fatimid—we must rescue him and punish the thugs who imprison him."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_12_title:0 "One Lord, One State"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_1_12_desc:0 "The Islamic Caliphate once ruled a vast territory stretching from al-Andalus in the west to the Indus River Valley in the east. However, the long passage of time corrupted the once-proud Arab conquerors, and Persian culture eroded the devout jurists. Long before the Mongol westward expeditions, the Abbasid Caliphate had become a puppet in the hands of Turkic warlords; the arrival of our Mongols merely helped end its miserable fate of being manipulated ahead of schedule. Today, [Root.GetName] has proven her greatness by surpassing the boundaries of the Caliphate, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has demonstrated the fine qualities worthy of being the Caliph. From Muawiyah's usurpation to the Abbasid Revolution, from the rise of the Fatimid dynasty to the Mamluks' control of the Caliph, the farce of the Islamic world must cease. This time, it will be the Mongols who rebuild the Ummah and rule over all Muslims."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_3_title:0 "Execute the Elamites" # Execute the Elamite Remnants
EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_3_desc:0 "In 1358, southern Persia suffered a great drought. The Muzaffarid governor of Yazd demanded all non-believers pay triple the jizya to fund military needs. The Zoroastrians believed the governor was the incarnation of the drought demon Apusha, an evil spirit sent by the wicked god Ahriman to torment the followers of Ahura Mazda. The governor's son, Shah Shuja, secretly allied with the Zoroastrians. Armed with their own weapons, the Zoroastrians besieged Yazd. The governor's forces abandoned the city, and the governor himself was imprisoned and blinded by Shah Shuja. The Zoroastrian sacred fire, once extinguished with the decline of the Sassanid dynasty, was rekindled. The Muzaffarids, ungrateful for the khanate's benevolence, turned apostate and treasonous during the khanate's crisis, establishing their own rule. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] harbors deep hatred for them and swears to personally execute them."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_7_desc:0 "Following the collapse of the Sahada dynasty, Arabia is in a power vacuum. Like the Sassanids before us, we will conquer the endless sands of the south. It is only right that the peninsula's subjects and ideologies be ruled by Persian rulers. Even if Arabia cannot quickly bring substantial benefits to the empire, preventing it from falling into enemy hands is worthwhile."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_8_title:0 "Alawites? …"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_8_desc:0 "The Alawite sect is a Shiite branch founded by Ibn Nusayr in the mid-9th century. After the death of the Eleventh Imam, Nusayr declared himself the 'Hidden Imam' and recognized Ali as the 'manifestation of God.' His successor, Husayn ibn Hamdan al-Khasibi, further developed the sect's doctrines and spread them into Syria, where they merged with the Druze faith.\n\nBecause Alawite jurists in the southeastern Mediterranean had constant access to new information from Italy, Tunisia, and Iberia, they embraced many ideas from the Renaissance and Reformation. For the first time, this inspired and gave rise to numerous ideologies demanding change, national independence, and unity. Moreover, like us, they advocate for the deification of the monarch. More importantly, Alawite thought is highly popular among the urban class, and many cities have prospered due to the lubrication of Alawite influence. Since the Alawite sect spread to our country, some progressive jurists and the bourgeoisie have recognized its high value and believe we can cooperate with the Alawites."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_9_title:0 "The Safavids and the Sufis"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_9_desc:0 "The Safavid order was founded by Sheikh Safi al-Din in 1301 in Ardabil, northwestern Persia. Originally a Sunni Sufi order primarily composed of local Turkomans, it rapidly expanded, with members spreading across parts of Persia, Iraq, Anatolia, and Syria, and once received the support and patronage of the Ilkhanate. To this day, the Safavid order has gained widespread backing in Azerbaijan and western Iran. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wishes to consolidate his rule, he must seek religious support from the Safavid order."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_16_desc:0 "The untimely death of Möngke Khan interrupted the westward march of the Mongol Empire's symphony of conquest.

However, due to the news of Möngke Khan's death, the westward campaign did not continue. We have now surpassed the furthest reach of the Mongol western expeditions of old and once again defeated the coalition of these states that are neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. They are utterly insignificant before the Mongols!"

EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_19_title:0 "Invasion of Hispania"
EDG_MISSION_HZB_2_19_desc:0 "The House of Islam has long been lifeless; the outwardly fierce yet inwardly weak Sahada dynasty and the Ottoman Empire have only brought further disappointment. Following the initial failures of the Caliphate to capture Constantinople, cross the Pyrenees, and unify Iberia, the Islamic world turned inward, nurturing rich cultural and scientific achievements but achieving little in external expansion. We are the great conquerors who will reverse the apathy and stagnation of the Muslim world, unite it under the sacred sovereignty of the Great Khan, and expand the territories of the House of Islam for the first time in centuries."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_3_1_title:0 "The Ilkhanate Regent" # The Unacknowledged Ilkhanate Regent
EDG_MISSION_HZB_3_1_desc:0 "The Hazaraspid dynasty was originally a Kurdish tribe of the Zagros, bearing the title 'Thousand Horses,' ruling the barren mountainous regions that the Mongol conquerors were unwilling to govern. After the Golden Horde army breached Tabriz, the so-called Ilkhanate monarch vanished amidst the flames of war. The Hazaraspid secretly welcomed the deposed former great khan, Sati Beg Khanum, to the throne, and she entered into matrimony with the Hazaraspid clan leader. As various claimants met untimely deaths or succumbed to illness, by 1340, the female great khan became the sole legitimate heir. In 1345, Khan Sati Beg passed away, and her son Surgan and his descendants inherited the puppet khanate to this day.\n\nTimur's conquests brought shame upon the khan's court, stripping it of influence over the Iranian lands. The Hazaraspid Pillar of State is no longer acknowledged, even stirring ambitions within the great khan himself. We must prove the resilience of the regency and once again proclaim the name of the great state."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_3_5_desc:0 "The dream of the Supreme Pillar of State is fulfilled; the land of Iran-Shahr is entirely in our hands. Yet now, a new issue emerges: due to the long intermarriage between the Khan's court and the Hazaraspid clan, the two families have become interwoven, as close as one. Some ministers—including key family elders—believe that the Pillar's nephew, the current Ilkhan, possesses both civil and martial prowess, even to the point of pressuring the Pillar of State to return power to the Great Khan and step into the background. What shall we do? Continue maintaining the Hazaraspid Supreme Pillar's regency, or allow the Ilkhan to step back into the forefront? Only Heaven knows."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_3_desc:0 "Since Genghis Khan unified the steppe, the descendants of the Kerait and Naiman tribes, led by the last Naiman Khan Küchlüg, fled to the Western Liao. After twenty years of the Western Liao refusing shelter for fear of Mongol pressure, a Mongol tribe following the Nestorian faith emerged around the city of Farah—this was the Farah tribe. In the early days of the Mongol westward expeditions, the Farah people were still a submissive tribe under Mongol suzerainty. However, after Ghazan Khan converted to Islam, disrupting the Ilkhanate's policy of religious parity and demanding non-Muslims pay the jizya tax, the Farah people were among the first major separatist forces to break away when the khanate crumbled. They initially cooperated with Timur the Lame but swiftly betrayed the agreement after Timur's defeat by the warlord coalition. Nevertheless, the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is willing to show them mercy, allowing them to once again submit to the Khanate's saber. After all, 'If I can forgive the descendants of the Naiman, what reason do other enemies have not to surrender to me?'"

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_4_desc:0 "Afghanistan, the graveyard of empires, the gateway to India, Bactria, and the Persian Gulf, is home to the hardy, fierce, semi-nomadic Pashtuns. Fortunately, they are currently divided among several dynasties. Let us attack and conquer them while they are weak and disorganized. This will be a wise move to put the Khanate a step ahead."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_6_desc:0 "The Ganges River basin possesses some of the world's most fertile soil, as evidenced by the wealth of northern India. Although we have secured most of the natural borders adjacent to India, it is only a matter of time before other steppe empires rise and enter India from other directions to challenge us. We should preemptively seize the lands of Hindustan for ourselves."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_8_desc:0 "The northern flank of the ulus has repeatedly been violated by Uzbeks and Mughals, who seek to claim parts of our territory as their own. The uluses of Shiban and Chagatai never aligned with the Ilkhanate; they did not lend aid during its collapse, and they remained indifferent when the Hazaraspid clan later attempted to reunify it. The Khans of the Northern Frontier must be punished! Let them see who is the greatest successor of Genghis Khan!"

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_10_desc:0 "The tribes of the khanate are not always unified. Many still maintain subordination relationships and take pride in their lineage and ancestors. This division cannot continue. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has heard the call of the steppe. To achieve political stability and return to our long-yearned homeland, all tribes must be united."

EDG_MISSION_HZB_5_12_desc:0 "The Jurchens and their led Jin dynasty once competed with us in conquering the steppe and advancing south into the Central Plains, making them ancestral foes of our forebears. Ultimately, they were conquered by the Great Khan, and Genghis Khan proclaimed an unprecedented slaughter upon the Jurchen tribes. However, over time, a group of 'New Jurchens,' the Manchus, who migrated from farther regions into the former Jurchen lands, seem to be attempting once more to expand into the Central Plains under the banner of Jin. We must destroy them again."

Because storms destroyed all ships unfortunate enough to dare attack, the Japanese effortlessly wiped out Kublai Khan's army. However, no matter how miraculous this demonic wind, we are Mongols, and even the greatest storm we shall conquer. When the fleet of [Root.GetName] sets sail from the west, there will be no 'Divine Wind' to obstruct our campaign!"
