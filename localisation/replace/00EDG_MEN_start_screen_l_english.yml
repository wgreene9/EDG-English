However, the Bey of §YMentese§! took the opposite path, receiving baptism into Christianity and becoming an Orthodox believer. Inheriting the enlightened thought and religious tolerance policies from the time of Rum Sultan Kayqubad I, he won the favor of local Greek inhabitants and attracted Sufi Muslims following the teachings of Baba Ishak, as well as Karamanlides adhering to ancient Orthodox traditions.\n\nBut in the §Yever-fluctuating§! Anatolian peninsula, military might is the foundation of rule. The gradually de-nomadic Mentese lacked the capacity to organize large-scale armies. Whether from the northern §YOttomans§!, the eastern §YKaramanids§!, or even the §YKnights Hospitaller§!, any could deal a heavy blow to this tiny state. The reigning Bey made a startling decision—to pledge allegiance to the §YEastern Empire§!. Yet this move was rejected by Greek factions fearing foreign seizure of power. However, this Turkic family that converted to Orthodoxy gradually displayed a zealous convert's fervor. Eager to prove to the Greek cultural sphere that they too were Orthodox Christians and not savage Muslim Turks, almost every Bey of Mentese swore fealty to the Eastern Empire. The Beys of Mentese believed that treacherous officials had led Anatolia into its current state of warfare; only by making the restoration of the Eastern Roman Empire their mission could they change Orthodoxy's perilous situation and unite Greeks discontent with Muslim rule under their banner.\n\nThe current ruler of Mentese, §YIlyas III§!, has reigned for over thirty years. A precious opportunity has finally appeared before him: the Ottoman Empire is now divided; the ruler of Karaman is but a lifeless corpse with no authority; and the Eastern Empire, due to Theodore's rebellion, retains only Constantinople and its surroundings, trapped in a precarious struggle for survival. Such a moment is precisely the time to break the deadlock!\n\nMentese's dynastic lifespan has not been long, yet it has lingered on. Watchful external powers will not overlook this place, and Mentese's fate will be decided within a few years. In this time of crisis, will it indulge in pleasure awaiting the end, or §Ofight like true Romans!§!"
