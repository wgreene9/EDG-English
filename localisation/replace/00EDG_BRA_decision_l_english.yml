EDG_BRA_decesion_selectheir_title:0 "Select an Heir from the House of Hohenzollern"
EDG_BRA_decesion_selectheir_desc:0 "The House of Hohenzollern originated near Hechingen in the Duchy of Swabia. Its progenitor, Burkhard I, was granted the County of Zollern in the early 11th century, with lands between the upper Neckar River, the Swabian Jura, and the upper Danube. After generations of change and branching, the House split into several lines, including the Ansbach, Bayreuth, Sandomierz, and Swabian branches. Now, they are finally reunified, with all members of the Hohenzollern family united once more. \n\n With the major branches of the Hohenzollern family reunited, our monarch has devised a highly creative succession system. It abandons the narrow method of inheritance within a single line, instead choosing the most capable child from among several branches to become the new heir. \n\n This genius system of succession has ensured that each generation of [Root.GetAdjective] rulers possesses sufficient capability."
