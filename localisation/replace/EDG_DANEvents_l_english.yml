EDG_DANEvents.0.desc:0 "In 1429, Erik instituted the Sound Toll, imposing fees on all ships entering and leaving the Baltic Sea. This measure alleviated the strained state finances and gained Erik support from part of the burgher class, but it also attracted more enemies. Nations along the Baltic coast began to openly or covertly support forces opposing Erik. Soon after, Denmark entered a state of open war with Lübeck, the leading city of the Hanseatic League.\n\nIn 1417, Erik planned to turn Copenhagen into more easily controllable crown land, which met stubborn resistance from the local and surrounding nobility. Erik achieved his goal through assassinations and other violent means, but this caused many powerful nobles to lose trust in him.\n\nIn 1434, Swedish peasants and miners initiated unrest, followed by sporadic disturbances. Nobles across the realm used various methods to weaken royal power, leading Erik to turn to the domestic burgher class for support. He repeatedly allied with the burghers to attack the nobility, hoping to maintain his own power and weaken domestic opposition. However, the Danish burghers were more apprehensive of Erik's capricious and erratic rule. They held a meeting in Aarhus, drafting a plan to establish a commercial confederation, and the framework of the federation was laid down at this time.\n\nAfter the Danish nobility opposed Erik's designated heir, Erik took a hardline stance, ultimately triggering a civil war. Swedish Regent Karl VIII consequently gained full control of Sweden's state affairs, effectively freeing Sweden and Norway from the Kalmar Union.\n\nUnable to defeat the domestic nobility, Erik, in order to gain support from the burgher class, continuously granted them more power and even turned to Karl VIII for support, promising to cede the Skåne region to Sweden. With the help of Sweden and the domestic burghers, Erik successfully suppressed the domestic rebellion but was unwilling to cede Skåne. This led Sweden to abandon its cooperative relationship with Erik and instead seize control of Skåne by force.\n\nDeprived of external aid, Erik was eager to consolidate his rule domestically. He realized he had granted the burghers too much power, to the point where they threatened royal authority. He thus implemented many policies to weaken burgher power, which ultimately triggered a burgher uprising in 1439. The burghers defeated Erik, forcing him to grant greater autonomy to municipalities across the land, rendering the Kingdom of Denmark nominal and successfully implementing the commercial confederation plan originally drafted in Aarhus.\n\nThe Danish Confederation is a loose polity. Its plan was first drafted at the 1434 Aarhus Meeting, successfully implemented in 1439, and formally signed into the 'Danish Confederation Act' by various Danish free cities in Zealand that same year. The act stipulates that the federated cities shall coexist equally in a league form. Competition between cities is permitted, but mutual warfare is firmly opposed, hence a permanent alliance agreement was signed. Signatory members of the 'Danish Confederation Act' are prohibited from tearing up the alliance agreement for any reason.\n\nThe Confederation maintains a council hall in Zealand, a symbol of the entire confederation's existence. Can such a loose organization replace the former Kingdom of Denmark and sustain their commercial empire amidst the powers of northern Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire? Only time will tell."

The burghers defeated Erik, forcing him to grant greater autonomy to municipalities across the land, rendering the Kingdom of Denmark nominal and successfully implementing the commercial confederation plan originally drafted in Aarhus. After the victory of the Danish burgher class, they still faced the threat from Sweden.\n\nSwedish King Karl VIII effectively controlled the Skåne region that King Erik had promised him. Karl VIII entrusted Skåne to the Griffin family for administration and remained covetous of the Danish Confederation, desiring to bring the entire Danish region under his rule. After his defeat, the Danish King Erik became the Duke of Pomerania. He promised Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, that if he helped him restore Danish royal authority, he would be willing to have the Kingdom of Denmark become part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSigismund was unable to help Erik at that time, but this inadvertently provided a solution for the Danish Confederation. To prevent Imperial attacks and to gain Imperial protection against the Swedish threat, the Danish Confederation proposed to Emperor Sigismund to join the Holy Roman Empire. Upon receiving agreement, it became part of the Empire and obtained many privileges to counterbalance Hanseatic expansion in the northern Empire.\n\nThe Danish Confederation is a loose polity. Its plan was first drafted at the 1434 Aarhus Meeting, successfully implemented in 1439, and formally signed into the 'Danish Confederation Act' by various Danish free cities in Zealand that same year.
