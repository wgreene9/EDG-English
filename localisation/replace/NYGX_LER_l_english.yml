We raise the banner of faith to unite the Polish people, taking up arms, ready at all times to defend our faith and nation. The Rus', the Roman Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire—those who see us as lambs for the slaughter, those who seek our destruction, those who are ever-warring and covet our lands—will ultimately pay the price for their transgression.

The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.\n\nAll have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\nSome indulge in pleasure, forgetting God's will. Some are not content with what they have, coveting the lands of others. Some have forsaken their rightful place, not submitting to God's order. This is sin, and they shall fall into eternal punishment.\n\nFor all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\nNow our enemies have come to understand this profoundly. Poland is under God's protection. We accept Jesus as our Savior, sincerely repent and confess our sins, seeking the precious blood shed by Lord Jesus on the cross to cleanse and forgive us.\n\nThe corrupt and decadent Roman Papacy does not realize this. They treat Christ's truth as a plaything, willfully distorting His divine will. The Apocalypse shall come. The unbelievers and the impure shall face the judgment of the end times. Then, we shall become followers of Christ and enter with Him into the New Jerusalem."
