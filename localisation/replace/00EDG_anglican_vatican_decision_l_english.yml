EDG_anglican_parish_235_decision_title:0 "£icon_EDG_anglican£ Establish the Diocese of Canterbury"
EDG_anglican_parish_235_decision_desc:0 "Canterbury has a long history and has always been one of Christianity's holy sites. In 595 AD, Pope Gregory the Great dispatched the missionary Saint Augustine to preach in the Kent region of Britain. Accompanied by forty monks, Augustine arrived in the Saxon Kingdom of Kent (located in present-day Kent County, England, ruled by Saxons) to spread the faith. At that time, the king was a pagan, but the queen, originally a Frankish princess, was a Christian. With the queen's assistance, Augustine gained a foothold and successfully persuaded the King of Kent to convert to Catholicism. The king allowed Augustine to choose a site to build a church. Augustine selected Canterbury, which had been abandoned for over a century, as the location. The church became known as Canterbury Cathedral. After its completion, Saint Augustine naturally became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and spread Christianity throughout England. Therefore, in England, Canterbury is figuratively described as the cradle of Christian faith. The bishop of the Canterbury region is known as the Archbishop of Canterbury, with Canterbury Cathedral as his seat. The Archbishop of Canterbury holds a high religious status, equivalent to the leader of Catholicism in the English region. Typically, he presides over the coronation of English monarchs. This archbishop also holds jurisdiction over 29 dioceses. Thus, as the archbishop's seat, Canterbury gradually evolved into the religious capital of England."

EDG_anglican_parish_236_decision_title:0 "£icon_EDG_anglican£ Establish the Diocese of Westminster"
EDG_anglican_parish_236_decision_desc:0 "The name Westminster originates from Westminster Abbey, referring to the area surrounding the Abbey. 'Westminster' itself is a combination of 'West' and 'Minster' (a large church). Originally a Catholic Benedictine monastery, it was first built in 960 AD, expanded in 1045, completed in 1065, and rebuilt between 1220 and 1517. It can be considered England's most prestigious church. Besides royalty, many of Britain's great figures from various fields are buried here. Westminster Abbey is neither the cathedral of a major diocese nor a parish church; it is known as a Royal Peculiar, a church under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch. Its administration and regulations are determined by the Crown. It has always been the site for the burial or coronation of British monarchs (from the periods of England, Great Britain to the Commonwealth). It briefly served as a cathedral from 1546 to 1556."

EDG_anglican_parish_239_decision_title:0 "£icon_EDG_anglican£ Establish the Diocese of Gloucester"
EDG_anglican_parish_239_decision_desc:0 "Gloucester Cathedral is located in Gloucestershire in southern England, on the north side of the city, close to the river. Gloucester Cathedral has been a pilgrimage site for over 1300 years. Expansion began in 681 AD on a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter. It is the burial place of King Edward II of England. Historically, it was also the only church besides Westminster Abbey in London where English kings were crowned. Gloucester Cathedral has a prayer: 'Merciful and holy Father, in the power of the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, grant us wisdom to know you; grant us knowledge to understand you; grant us diligence to seek you; grant us patience to wait for you; grant us eyes to behold you; grant us hearts to meditate on you; grant us lives to praise you. Amen.'"

EDG_anglican_parish_245_decision_title:0 "£icon_EDG_anglican£ Establish the Diocese of York"
EDG_anglican_parish_245_decision_desc:0 "York Minster is the largest Gothic cathedral in the United Kingdom. Construction began in the early 13th century and was completed 250 years later. York, located in northeastern England, was initially a Gaelic settlement and later occupied by Romans, Angles, Danes, and Normans. For nearly 2,000 years, York served as the capital of Northern England, a status comparable to London today. York is one of the UK's most famous historical and cultural cities, with deep connections to the Roman Empire and the Vikings. Its founding dates back to 71 AD when it served as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior. In 71 AD, the Romans established a fortress for defense, surrounded by medieval city walls. Centered around York Minster, the Romans built a five-kilometer square wall in the 7th century. For the Romans, York ('Eboracum') was a major military base; Roman Emperor Septimius Severus and Constantius Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great, died there in 211 AD and 306 AD respectively. Constantine the Great was proclaimed emperor by the army in York (the only other place where emperors were proclaimed was Rome itself). William I of England, the Conqueror, launched a series of punitive campaigns against local rebellions. Castles were built on the banks of the River Ouse. During this time, York gradually became an important city and the administrative center of Yorkshire. An archbishopric was established here, and by the late 13th and 14th centuries, the archbishop's authority became a major administrative institution second only to the royal government. It was also a significant trade center. After the Norman Conquest, several religious buildings were constructed, including St. Mary's Abbey and Holy Trinity Priory, and the city became royal property."
