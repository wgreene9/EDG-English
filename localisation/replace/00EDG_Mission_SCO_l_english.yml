EDG_SCO_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Since 1295, due to our tense relations with our covetous southern neighbor, France, which shared the same strategic needs as us, entered into a long-standing alliance with us. For over a hundred years thereafter, we have maintained military and strategic allyship with France."

EDG_SCO_mission_1_2_title:0 "The Shattered Crown" # Integrating the Shattered Crown
EDG_SCO_mission_1_2_desc:0 "Since the time of the Kingdom of Alba, the Hebrides have acknowledged the leadership of our royal house. However, owing to the geopolitical advantages and relatively isolated geography of the region, local rulers have paid only nominal homage to the crown while governing independently, effectively becoming separate kingdoms. We should establish truly centralized rule there, laying the foundation for future expansion."

EDG_SCO_mission_1_3_title:0 "Rulers of the North Sea"
EDG_SCO_mission_1_3_desc:0 "Orkney, the Faroe Islands, Shetland… Long before the arrival of the Roman Empire, our ancestors had already settled on the islands of the North Sea. However, between the 8th and 10th centuries AD, northern invaders sailing dragon ships shattered the peace of those lands. We must reclaim our ancestors' territories and establish effective control over the North Sea."

EDG_SCO_mission_1_5_title:0 "The Cod War"
EDG_SCO_mission_1_5_desc:0 "Nearly all of Europe's cod comes from the North Sea. Every year, those Northern Europeans make a fortune by selling cod to the south. Now, having gained control of the North Sea, we look forward to initiating a "Cod War" to take a share of the lucrative trade from the Norse."

EDG_SCO_mission_1_8_title:0 "Revenge on the Vikings" # Revenge Against the Vikings
EDG_SCO_mission_1_8_desc:0 "Centuries ago, when the northern heathens, sailing dragon ships and wielding great axes, descended upon our coasts, our people were powerless to resist. Under the threat of siege, we were forced to sign one unequal treaty after another. Now, when Scottish sails appear off the coasts of Scandinavia, we will make them feel the same fear we felt centuries ago."

EDG_SCO_mission_1_9_title:0 "Pearl of the North"
EDG_SCO_mission_1_9_desc:0 "As we gained control over the entire North Sea's trade flows and commercial hubs, we established an efficient trade network. Through North Sea tariffs and the resale of goods, Scotland now holds one of Europe's economic lifelines. Even a small tributary of this "dragon vein" brings immense wealth, let alone the fact that we can now manipulate its entirety."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_1_title:0 "The Elective Council" # Reform the Elective Council
EDG_SCO_mission_2_1_desc:0 "The founding of our nation began with an alliance of several Gaelic and Pictish tribes. The tribes elected their shared leader, who was crowned King of Alba. Today, to achieve greater centralization and prepare for southern invasions, we must reform the elective monarchy to better serve our needs."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_2_title:0 "The Lothian Privy Council"
EDG_SCO_mission_2_2_desc:0 "After reforming the elective system, our king can establish relatively unified leadership. However, it is impossible for the king alone to govern the entire country in meticulous detail. We should establish a Privy Council in Lothian, gathering talented individuals to serve the crown."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_4_desc:0 "The East Midlands have maintained autonomy for centuries, with local residents establishing their own administrative system, which has become a significant concern. After gaining control of this region, we should dismantle its administrative institutions to truly integrate it under the rule of our great king."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_5_title:0 "End the Free Lords"
EDG_SCO_mission_2_5_desc:0 "East Anglia has maintained political independence since the nation's founding, hindering the unification of Britain. After gaining control here, we must abolish the local free lords to ensure our royal authority prevails. Although initial resistance is inevitable, we believe this effort will be worthwhile."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_6_title:0 "Establish the Royal Fleet"
EDG_SCO_mission_2_6_desc:0 "With Essex under our control, we can establish a Royal Fleet here. Essex's strategic location firmly guards the gateway to the English Channel, and stationing our Royal Navy here will provide genuine strategic value."

EDG_SCO_mission_2_7_desc:0 "Through comprehensive control of the English Channel and the trade protection offered by the Royal Navy, we have established a monopolistic trade dominance in the Channel.

EDG_SCO_mission_2_8_title:0 "Restoring the Order of Rule"
EDG_SCO_mission_2_8_desc:0 "Our ancestors once roamed across all of Britannia. However, the arrival of the Romans changed everything.

EDG_SCO_mission_3_2_title:0 "The Alexander Reforms"
EDG_SCO_mission_3_2_desc:0 "Alexander the 'Great,' Scotland's renowned statesman, reformer, and military strategist.

EDG_SCO_mission_2_9_title:0 "Ruling Britannia"
EDG_SCO_mission_2_9_desc:0 "Rule always faces various obstacles at the outset—local separatists, loyalists, hereditary nobles… All of this once overwhelmed us. However, wounds will eventually heal, leaving behind new skin. We have ultimately won the heartfelt allegiance of all the people of Britannia."

EDG_SCO_mission_4_1_title:0 "Insular Christianity"
EDG_SCO_mission_4_1_desc:0 "While the Christianity of Ireland upholds the leadership of the Catholic Church, it is also imbued with strong local characteristics. Irish Christianity retains significant remnants of Celtic Druidic paganism. The religion of Ireland must be reformed to embrace the true gospel of the Heavenly Father."

EDG_SCO_mission_4_2_desc:0 "Since the death of Cormac mac Airt, Ireland has plunged into a great chaos lasting a millennium. Local warlords contend for power, and the people suffer immensely.

EDG_SCO_mission_4_6_title:0 "Control the Strategic Front"
EDG_SCO_mission_4_6_desc:0 "As we advance into western England, we encounter the rugged terrain of the Yorkshire Dales. This does not favor establishing our control over England. By occupying Lancaster and Chester, we can secure a true foothold in the western region of England and lay the groundwork for the wars to come."

EDG_SCO_mission_4_7_title:0 "Suppress Rebel Forces" # Suppress Rebellious Forces
EDG_SCO_mission_4_7_desc:0 "After our conquest of England, numerous rebellious local nobles and stubborn separatist forces remain active. They seek to incite rebellion and restore England to its former old order. We must maintain strict vigilance to ensure the peace and stability of England."

EDG_SCO_mission_4_8_title:0 "Church of Scotland" # Scotland's National Church
EDG_SCO_mission_4_8_desc:0 "Since we embraced Catholicism, we have always followed the leadership of the corrupt Papacy. The Pope continually attempts to interfere in our politics through religious influence and even openly demands bribes from us. Our patience has reached its limit. If the people of the Holy Roman Empire can be justified by faith, then we too can act under the banner of the Crown, not that of the Pope."

EDG_SCO_mission_4_9_title:0 "The National Church"
EDG_SCO_mission_4_9_desc:0 "Since the establishment of Scotland's national church, some stubborn believers still resist, secretly following the orders of their so-called false Pope.
