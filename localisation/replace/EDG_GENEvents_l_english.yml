EDG_GENEvents.0.name:0 "The City of Janus"
EDG_GENEvents.0.desc:0 "At the northernmost tip of the Western Mediterranean, where the northwestern slopes of the Apennine Mountains plunge steeply into the Ligurian Sea, cutting through the city and descending sharply, the resulting steep cliffs and rocky beaches lack fertile plains like those of the Po Valley. Yet, within the magnificent arches formed under the protection of the gatekeeper god Janus, several natural harbors were nurtured. Nestled between the mountains and the sea lies the ancient city—Genoa.\n\nGenoa's history stretches back as far as ancient Rome, though it has existed as an independent state for barely over four hundred years. The arrival of the First Crusade presented Genoa with the opportunity to rise, and it began its own voyages of exploration alongside the crusaders, extracting profit from each holy war: Antioch, Jerusalem... the Levant was filled with the footsteps and presence of Genoese merchants, and the cross of Saint George flew high across the Mediterranean.\n\nBut the Mediterranean permits only one hegemon. Just as Genoa dominated the Western Mediterranean, at the other end of the Italian peninsula, the Republic of Venice, situated in the harbor of the Adriatic Sea, reaped enormous windfalls from the Fourth Crusade. Over more than a century, from 1253 to 1381, four great wars erupted between Venice and Genoa, culminating in Genoa's decisive defeat by Venice at the Battle of Chioggia, plunging it into a deep trough.\n\nTo make matters worse, the military coup led by Filiberto di Savoia in 1437 resulted in the Republic losing all its overseas colonial holdings and the strategically vital Corsican peninsula, leaving its current situation precarious. Amidst internal troubles and external threats, in what manner will Genoa reclaim its past glory?"

EDG_GENEvents.1.desc:0 "It has proven that power gained through dishonorable means cannot maintain stability within this ancient Republic. When Filiberto, in 1439, took control of the army composed of mercenaries and Genoese citizens through military achievements, prestige, bribery, and other methods, and occupied the Republic of Genoa, perhaps the Republican faction within the country, out of consideration for their interests, tacitly consented to this action. Thus, until 1443, the Republic of Genoa remained superficially calm.\n\nUntil Filiberto's death in 1443, when his son attempted to establish a hereditary system in Genoa, styling himself 'Duke.' This action thoroughly crossed the bottom line of the Republican faction within Genoa, and thus rebellion swiftly descended upon this already unstable and waning state. Although this rebellion was quickly suppressed, it lost all its overseas territories. The continuous decline of its influence further exacerbated Genoa's already unhealthy economy.\n\nAs domestic discontent gradually grew, the previously defeated Republican faction began to unite with other classes that had lost patience with Carlo di Savoia, vowing to restore Genoa's past glory and placing their hopes in the ancient republican system.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] must face a rebellious populace far larger than in the past, and this time, for [Root.Monarch.GetName], there are no more choices—what one has seized will be seized by others."

If mercenaries could be managed through an entire state apparatus, centrally controlled and coordinated by the state, dispatched and planned for various foreign affairs, then both militarily and economically, [Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead his mercenary kingdom to build a platform founded purely on steel and contract.

EDG_GENEvents.17.name:0 "Grand Opening"
EDG_GENEvents.17.desc:0 "Genoa's past participation in trade and economic activities differed from Venice's pure commerce. During the trade wars with Venice, [Root.GetName] realized the instability of commercial activities and the necessity of other ventures to stabilize its economy. Thus emerged one of the world's earliest public banks.\n\nThe Bank of Saint George is one of the earliest banks established in Europe. Formed in 1407 by creditors of the Genoese government, it was created to consolidate various debts, represent the creditors, and ensure their debts were repaid. Its primary business involved managing government debt, safeguarding government revenues like tariffs, accepting deposits, issuing currency, and lending to the government.\n\nThe intent behind establishing the bank was clear: to reduce debt, which also meant banking was a source of profit, and to enforce legal tender laws. The bank accepted deposits not as demand deposits but as time deposits paid periodically. It only issued secured loans to the city government, tax farmers, and tax collectors. In the past, its foreign exchange business only involved revenues collected from Genoese possessions in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nDuring Genoa's monetary reform in 1437, the Bank of Saint George's balances became legal tender. However, the bank failed to prevent the continuous rise in the market price of gold coins. Consequently, the city government at the time gave the bank two choices: either adhere to the legal valuation of gold coins or relinquish its banking charter. In 1444, the Bank of Saint George chose the latter and was forced to close due to external factors.\n\nBut now we possess sufficient economic strength to restart this bank and revitalize our nation's financial sector. This will be a major turning point for [Root.GetName]'s trade economy. In the past, the Bank of Saint George was a privately-formed non-governmental organization. This new model, directly managed and participated in by the national government, may just bring a small shock to the world."

EDG_GENEvents.18.desc:0 "The Casa di San Giorgio is a unique mechanic, roughly simulating the operations of the Bank of Saint George. Its functionality is divided into two progress bars: Operational Efficiency and Bank Reserves.\n\nBank Reserves represent the available deposits of the Bank of Saint George, while Operational Efficiency reflects the overall functioning of the bank. Higher Bank Reserves can increase Operational Efficiency. However, Operational Efficiency has a decay mechanism that intensifies as the bar fills, meaning maintaining high efficiency requires consistently high reserves.\n\nUnlike most other government mechanics, the state cannot overly interfere with this system. It can only perform the most basic fund allocation, transferring Bank Reserves to the national treasury or vice versa.\n\nThe Casa di San Giorgio mechanic requires cooperation from other nations. Once we unlock it, all eligible countries can engage in three basic banking interactions with us: Deposit, Withdraw, and Loan. These interactions directly affect the Bank Reserves and can be performed without requiring our approval.\n\nFurthermore, in the diplomatic interface with each country, we will unlock an interaction button. This button allows us to view each nation's credit situation with the Casa di San Giorgio, enabling us to perform certain interactions targeted at that specific country."

For the Republicans and Monarchists, their visions for what kind of state [Root.GetName] should become seem like absolute extremes—a clash between republic and autocracy. Yet, both factions seem to have lost sight of the ultimate purpose behind these struggles.\n\nMerchants and mercenaries alike strive for the same goal—profit. Any discussion detached from activities predicated on profit is meaningless. This holds true for the two factions in [Root.GetName]. Only absolute profit can fulfill their final expectations. Achieving this does not necessarily require mutual destruction. Perhaps finding a possible balance based on profit between the two factions and establishing a cooperative government could satisfy the ultimate goals of both—or perhaps another path exists.\n\nHowever, realizing this will not be easy. Clashes of opinion during the process and disagreements on state governance will continually trouble [Root.GetName]. Yet, the process must ultimately move towards its result. When the shared goal of both is reached, a state dominated by absolute profit will be born upon it. This nation, built on steel, contract, and profit, will begin to prove its strength."

Sacraments, communion, and icons lost their importance in Occitania.\n\nWhen the Cathar trumpet sounded in Lombardy, the people, long oppressed by the Catholic Church—whether they spoke Occitan, French, or the Lombard dialect of Italian—took up the banner of rebellion, driving the main branch of our family from their ancestral lands and establishing a Cathar Republic. Yet, the House of Savoy did not vanish. By a twist of fate, a cadet branch found a foothold in Genoa. After consolidating their rule, they now prepare to reclaim their homeland and exact revenge for the deeds of the Cathar mobs decades prior.\n\nTime will prove everything. Past failures and dire circumstances have been resolved one by one. As Cathar forces withdraw from this ancestral soil, the House of Savoy, after decades of wandering, returns to the land of their origin. This time, they bear a new title: Count of Genoa—though it contains certain incongruities, for the House of Savoy, a new era has dawned.\n\nWith the Savoy region reclaimed, the Cathar vision of northward expansion is shattered.

However, over time, the erosion of privileges and Muslim counter-offensives have made it increasingly difficult to rebuild past glory by following the Crusaders' path. Genoese merchants are reluctant to invest in directions with no visible returns. Nonetheless, violent expansion remains an option. If we can seize the privileges we need by force, it will contribute to the reconstruction of Genoa's trade network.\n\nConsidering the religious landscape of the Mediterranean coast, commerce need not depend on faith.
