EDG_mission_GER_1_18_desc:0 "The Anglo-Saxons are also a branch of the Germanic peoples. Although they may not be of pure blood today, we still have sufficient reason to bring the inhabitants of the British Isles under our rule."

EDG_mission_GER_1_21_title:0 "The Ruhr Region"
EDG_mission_GER_1_21_desc:0 "The Ruhr region boasts an exceptionally favorable geographical location. Since ancient times, it has been part of the 'Holy Road' connecting Eastern and Western Europe, and a shortcut from Northern to Central and Southern Europe, situated at a European transportation crossroads. Since the value of coal was discovered, the Ruhr's economy has had the opportunity to soar."

EDG_mission_GER_1_23_title:0 "The October Edict"
EDG_mission_GER_1_23_desc:0 "The October Edict, fully titled the 'Edict Concerning the Relaxation of Restrictions on Land Possession, the Free Use of Real Estate, and the Personal Relations of Rural Inhabitants,' was issued on October 9, 1807, by Prussian Chief Minister Stein. It concerned land freedom and serf emancipation. The edict abolished personal serfdom: for hereditary landholders, this bondage ended immediately upon the edict's promulgation; for non-hereditary landholders and landless peasants, it ended on St. Martin's Day (November 11) in 1810. Establishing new personal subjugation was prohibited. It removed various feudal restrictions on land sales and transfers, granting all citizens ownership and free trade rights over all forms of real estate. It allowed Junker landowners to engage in commerce and industry, and permitted burghers and peasants to freely choose their occupations. This edict became the hallmark of the beginning of Prussian bourgeois reforms and one of the most significant measures of the Stein-Hardenberg reforms. However, the edict still retained all peasant obligations and the Junkers' judicial and administrative powers."

EDG_mission_GER_1_24_title:0 "Integrate the States"
EDG_mission_GER_1_24_desc:0 "We have formally unified Germany, but we have yet to fully control every inch of our land. Many states still exist within Germany; we need to establish more effective rule through various means."

EDG_mission_GER_2_19_desc:0 "Although Germany missed the era of colonialism, our current strength gives us ample qualification to seize a place in the sun!"

EDG_mission_GER_2_22_title:0 "Modern Agricultural Economy"
EDG_mission_GER_2_22_desc:0 "The medieval economic model of serfdom and feudal manors must be ended. We will establish a more efficient modern agricultural economic system to produce more food and support a larger population."

EDG_mission_GER_2_23_title:0 "Land Reform"
EDG_mission_GER_2_23_desc:0 "Many peasants and minor nobles hold vast tracts of land, trapped in the constraints of small-scale production, which hinders our implementation of more efficient production methods. We need land reform that better aligns with advanced productive forces."

EDG_mission_GER_3_21_title:0 "German Industrialization"
EDG_mission_GER_3_21_desc:0 "Industrial development is a prominent feature of German industrialization, but industrialization should not be narrowly understood as merely industrial growth. Industrialization is the core of modernization—the process of transforming a traditional agricultural society into a modern industrial one. Achieving industrialization is a long and arduous process, requiring substantial investment of resources and capital."

EDG_mission_GER_3_22_title:0 "Reichsmark"
EDG_mission_GER_3_22_desc:0 "After the unification of the German Empire, industrialization advanced comprehensively, gradually forming a common market, and economic development demanded a unified currency. However, centuries of division had resulted in an extremely chaotic monetary system. Though three major monetary agreements in the 19th century (the 1837 Munich Coinage Treaty, the 1838 Dresden Coinage Treaty, and the 1857 Vienna Coinage Treaty) aimed to standardize and unify the system, the reality was not optimistic. In everyday transactions at the grassroots level, a wide variety of currencies—even ancient coins—remained in circulation across German towns and villages. From January 1, 1876, the gold mark became the legal tender within the German Empire. The German Empire's issuance of the gold mark as the standard currency in circulation accelerated the formation of the international gold standard."

EDG_mission_GER_3_23_title:0 "The Empire's Banker"

EDG_mission_GER_4_19_title:0 "Annex the Balkans"
EDG_mission_GER_4_19_desc:0 "The peoples of the Balkans have never submitted to the rule of great empires. Whether Romans, Ottomans, or Bulgarians, none truly tamed them. We will end their defiance."

EDG_mission_GER_4_22_title:0 "Public Culture"

EDG_mission_GER_5_18_title:0 "Contest for Pannonia"
EDG_mission_GER_5_18_desc:0 "Pannonia has long been an arena for competition among major Eastern powers. Hungarians, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Ruthenians have all sought to extract benefits from this region. Now, as one of Europe's most powerful nations, we too should seek our interests in Pannonia."

EDG_mission_GER_5_21_title:0 "Educational Reform"
