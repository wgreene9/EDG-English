EDG_flavorORM.1.t:0 "The Last Glimmer of the Kingdom of Hormuz"
EDG_flavorORM.1.d:0 "Hormuz, located on the island of Hormuz north of the Strait of Hormuz, is an ancient Iranian city and seaport. There is an Old Hormuz and a New Hormuz. Old Hormuz was a coastal city near Minab, not far from Bandar Abbas, its precise location unclear. It existed since pre-Islamic times and, until around 1000 AD, served as a transshipment point for goods from Kerman. Ibn Khordadbeh's historical work 'The Book of Roads and Kingdoms' records Old Hormuz as a trade center for Kerman. From around 1000 AD, it became the seat of a minor dynasty, possibly of Omani descent.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hormuz, founded in the 10th century, originally had its capital in the Persian mainland to the north, but like Basra, it was destroyed in the turmoil of war.\n\nIn 1229, when Ögedei Khan, the newly ascended Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, led his armies into Persia to suppress the Khwarazmian prince Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the island of Hormuz also launched a western campaign for its own commercial interests. They allied with Arab tribal forces from the mainland to capture and burn Kish Island, thereby establishing Hormuz Island as the center of the Persian Gulf trade network. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, leveraging trade and the chaotic conditions on the surrounding mainland while remaining secure on their island, the Hormuzis expanded their power. Taking advantage of the weak control of the Aq Qoyunlu (White Sheep Turkomans) over Mesopotamia, the Kingdom of Hormuz even regained control of the Hormuz coast to the north.\n\nWith the disintegration of the Ilkhanate in the 14th century, the Persian Gulf islands were unified under the King of Hormuz, an Arab Sunni ruling this semi-independent principality. Even before consolidating power, they used their navy to capture rival port cities, such as Kish in 1229. After the Hormuz rulers conquered Kish, Hormuz was considered the primary port city of the Persian Gulf and a trade hub with the East, a status it maintained until the resurgence of Persian warlords.\n\nHowever, these prosperous times were short-lived. As powerful Persian warlords shattered Timur's invasion and the authority of the Ilkhanate once again loomed over the Persian lands, the Kingdom of Hormuz suffered heavy blows, losing all its cities and strongholds on the Persian coast north of Hormuz Island. Misfortune never comes singly. Attacks soon followed from traditional powers of the Arabian Peninsula: the Sultanate of Al-Hasa, the Sultanate of Oman, and even the Yas tribe.\n\nBy the year 1444, the Kingdom of Hormuz had lost almost all its mainland territories except for its home island, retreating to the small island of Hormuz. In November 1444, a young new Sultan of Hormuz, merely twenty-two years old, hastily took up the heavy burden from his father, who had died from overwork and worry. Although this young Sultan of Hormuz had never been highly regarded, with many considering his abilities mediocre, his father insisted on sending him to study in Persia, whose court was widely recognized in Central Asia as the most advanced. Now, this young Sultan, accustomed to the advanced culture of the Persians, was deeply captivated by Persian identity.\n\nCan he lead the battered, even moribund, Kingdom of Hormuz out of its current lamentable state, onto a Persianizing path of prosperity, perhaps even reunite the Persian lands and establish a new Persian Empire, claiming the title of Shahanshah? Let us wait and see."

EDG_flavorORM.2.t:0 "Our Path in Islam"
EDG_flavorORM.2.d:0 "With our conquest of the Oman region, serious religious divisions within our country have begun to deeply trouble our state. For a long time, the Sultanate of Oman on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf has been a significant area for Ibadi activity, with even their Sultans having openly supported Ibadi doctrines. The Kingdom of Hormuz, for a considerable period, has long adhered to Sunni Islam. Now that these lands of the Oman region have come under our jurisdiction, many Ibadi communities have publicly stated that our interpretation and enforcement of Sharia law are inappropriate and unsuitable. We now face a serious question: what path in Islam should we follow?\n\nOur court advisors have proposed three feasible strategies. On one hand, given our long reliance on Sunni jurisprudence for governance and its considerable success in the past, we should persist in our faith. We could appoint more qadis (judges) to Ibadi communities to compel them to change their views. On the other hand, many believe we should tolerate differences among the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence. On our future path of conquest, we will encounter followers of many different madhhabs; as long as we all faithfully believe in Allah, we are one family. There is also the most radical faction, which claims that Ibadi Islam is the correct path. Adhering to Sunni jurisprudence over the past century has brought grave disasters upon our Kingdom of Hormuz; perhaps we should change our thinking and follow a newer, more vibrant sect.\n\nSupporters of these three differing opinions are arguing fiercely in the Sultan's court. However, the final decision rests in the Sultan's hands."
