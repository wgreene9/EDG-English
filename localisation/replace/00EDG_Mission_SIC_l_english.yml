EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_1_title:0 "Independent Diplomacy"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_1_desc:0 "Since the 12th century, after we overthrew the brutal rule of the Romans and re-established the Bulgarian Empire, our nation has truly become independent and self-reliant. Located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, where religious beliefs are complex, our diplomatic direction is influenced accordingly. We need the support of Christians as well as maintaining good relations with heathens."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_3_title:0 "Enfeoff Skanderbeg"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_3_desc:0 "Since the mid-15th century, the Albanian rebel forces led by Skanderbeg have been harassing the region of Albania. This presents us with a great opportunity. Through political, economic, and even military infiltration of Albania, we can develop Skanderbeg into the leader of a regime under our control."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_4_title:0 "A Loyal Ally"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_4_desc:0 "The friendly relations between Albania and ourselves have a long history. After we formally enfeoffed Skanderbeg, we were able to facilitate sweeping reforms in Albania. Having resolved its domestic issues, Albania is now our loyal ally, providing a considerable force for our military expansion."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_5_title:0 "Expel the Venetians"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_1_5_desc:0 "Since the Fourth Crusade, the prosperous city of Ragusa has been humiliatingly reduced to a puppet of the Venetians, controlling the coastal trade of the Adriatic Sea. We must completely drive the Venetians out of the Balkans. To this end, Ragusa is crucial and our next destination."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_2_title:0 "Friends with Skanderbeg" # Foster Friendship with Skanderbeg
EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_2_desc:0 "Decades have passed since Skanderbeg launched his uprising in Albania. Now, the Ottoman Empire is crumbling, and Albania has firmly established itself. We should foster friendship with Skanderbeg to lay the foundation for our expansion of influence in the Balkans and facilitate our advance into Greece."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_4_title:0 "March on Tsargrad"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_4_desc:0 "Through our numerous campaigns, both major and minor, against Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire is now completely under our leadership. From now on, this shall be our capital. We will rename it Tsargrad (the City of the Tsar) and inherit the legitimate status of Eastern Rome."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_6_title:0 "Byzantine Legacy"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_2_6_desc:0 "With our conquest of most of the Balkans, Bulgaria has been unified into a powerful state. It is time for us to declare that we inherit the legitimate legacy of the Byzantine Empire—the Great Bulgarian Empire. We shall carry on the will of Eastern Rome and declare war on the Turks who have invaded Roman lands."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_1_title:0 "Bulgarian Independence" # The Bulgarian War of Independence
EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_1_desc:0 "Much time has passed since Bulgaria gained its independence. However, major foreign powers still cast greedy eyes upon us. The Poles, Hungarians, and Turks all desire to carve a piece of flesh from our body. Now, after numerous battles and reorganizations, we have essentially safeguarded Bulgaria's independence."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_2_title:0 "Overthrow Serbia"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_2_desc:0 "Serbia took advantage of our internal and external troubles to seize our eastern territories in the chaos. Now, our nation is stable, and our armies are reorganized. It is time for those Serbs to witness our might. We shall annihilate Serbia; this will be the starting point of our conquest."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_3_title:0 "End Nemanjic Rule" # Abolish the Nemanjic Dynasty
EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_3_desc:0 "The Nemanjic Dynasty has held the Principality of Serbia for centuries. As the traditional noble power of Serbia, the Nemanjic Dynasty wields profound influence over the region. With our complete conquest of Serbia, we should abolish the Nemanjic Dynasty to severely undermine the local entrenched powers."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_4_title:0 "Integrate the Legacy of Stefan"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_4_desc:0 "As the legendary ruler of Romania, Voivode Stefan once largely unified the Balkan Peninsula. However, his sudden departure led to the gradual disintegration of his empire. We shall integrate his legacy, thoroughly cleanse the remaining Serbian forces, and seize the opportunity to advance upon the entire Balkans."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_5_title:0 "Disperse the Krstjanis" # Dissolve the Church of the Krstjani
EDG_MISSION_BUL_3_5_desc:0 "As a transitional zone between Roman Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy, the region of Bosnia has long harbored a unique faith blending characteristics of both. We cannot tolerate this heretical sect, which maintains countless ties with the Roman heretical church. We must completely abolish the Bosnian Church."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_2_title:0 "Liberate Our Compatriots"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_2_desc:0 "With the reclaiming of all Bulgarian-populated lands within the Principality of Serbia, we can declare that we have finally liberated all our compatriots from Serbian oppression. The Bulgarians within Serbia can now be tightly united, gathered under the same banner."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_4_title:0 "Bulgarian Unification"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_4_desc:0 "Finally, through our relentless efforts, all Bulgarians are united under our rule. The Bulgarian people can now stand in the world as a complete nation. All Bulgarians bask in the glory of the Tsar, and the Bulgarians are destined to conquer the entire world."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_6_title:0 "Appoint the Croatian Ban"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_4_6_desc:0 "The administration of Croatia should be based on its traditional institution—the Ban. This administrative structure divides the country into several Banates, effectively leading local governance. We can appoint the Croatian Ban ourselves to contain and manage the rebellious local populace."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_1_title:0 "Form the Officer Corps"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_1_desc:0 "The Tsar's direct Officer Corps is the first step in military reform. By establishing an Officer Corps, we can provide the state with a wealth of military advisors for its expansion, avoiding the overreach of the Tsar's personal decisions in military affairs. This will make military decision-making more rational and reduce losses caused by personal biases."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_3_title:0 "Bulgari Light Cavalry"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_3_desc:0 "As one of the few nomadic peoples in Eastern Europe, the Bulgari have a long-standing tradition of horsemanship. Although the Bulgari have now settled, their light cavalry remains formidable in combat and exceptionally brave. By developing the Bulgari Light Cavalry, our nation's cavalry forces can be greatly enhanced."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_4_title:0 "The First Musketeers" # The First Musketeer Regiment
EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_4_desc:0 "The musket, as a new type of weapon, has gradually permeated Bulgaria through trade and diplomatic exchanges with Western European nations. To keep pace with this trend, we must establish our own musketeer regiments. We will form the First Musketeer Regiment and gradually promote the use of muskets."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_5_title:0 "Constantinian Line" # The Constantine Line
EDG_MISSION_BUL_5_5_desc:0 "Training in linear formations has become increasingly crucial in modern times. As line infantry becomes the mainstream of infantry forces, our nation should also strengthen our drill in formations. Through the training paradigm known as the 'Constantine Line,' we can cultivate a first-rate line infantry unit."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_6_title:0 "Shatter the Shield" # Shatter the Shield of Christendom
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_6_desc:0 "Hungary relies on its geographical advantages and vast territory to stubbornly guard the gates of Central Europe, earning it the name 'Shield of Christendom.' As our strength grows further, to advance into Central Europe, we must pry open this unyielding shield and extend our reach into the heart of the continent."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_7_title:0 "Conquer Romania"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_7_desc:0 "The Romanians rely on the Carpathian Mountains to maintain their cultural independence. This easily defensible mountain range also provides them with a foundation for survival. We should properly manage the Romanian people while transforming the Carpathians into an impregnable defensive barrier for ourselves."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_8_title:0 "Master the Danube"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_8_desc:0 "With our control over the Danube from its lower reaches to the coast, we already command most of this great river. Now, we must march towards its upper reaches and teach the proud Emperor and his lackeys a lesson. Onward to Germania, warriors of Bulgaria!"

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_9_title:0 "Rule the East"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_9_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we are now the most powerful polity in all of Eastern Europe. The entire Balkans, all of Central Europe, united under our banner. Now, we shall march east. We will cross the high mountains, we will reach Poland, we will reach Ruthenia. We are the masters of the East."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_11_title:0 "King of Kings"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_11_desc:0 "With our occupation of the Persian heartland, we now control most of the Iranian Plateau. Now, we are the true Shahanshah of Persia. We can establish Persian-style rule here, setting up satrapies to appease the local populace. The master of Persia is us."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_12_title:0 "Invade India"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_12_desc:0 "With our basic control over Khorasan, our next target lies further east. That land is called India, said to be filled with gold, rich and prosperous. We can thrust into India through the Khyber Pass, to conquer and rule this legendary land of gold."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_14_title:0 "Appoint Bailiffs"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_14_desc:0 "The bailiff, as a type of judicial auxiliary, is a great creation in the history of law. These local officials are directly used to enforce court rulings and disseminate them to the grassroots. By establishing bailiffs nationwide, our social order is effectively improved, and the power of local magnates is effectively curbed."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_15_title:0 "Court Reforms"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_15_desc:0 "The Court Act was promulgated to improve the order of the court, which had gradually descended into chaos as Bulgaria expanded. The act outlines the basic regulations of the court, standardizes the conduct of nobles and the royal family, effectively rectifying the court's disorder, and objectively improving its administrative efficiency."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_17_title:0 "Abolish Boyar Privileges" # Abolish Remaining Boyar Privileges
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_17_desc:0 "Boyars are the great local feudal lords in Slavic culture. These lords possessed unimaginable independence and local administrative power, troubling major Slavic polities from Rus', to Poland, and to the Balkans. With the end of the Boyar rebellions, we can finally reclaim the remaining privileges of the Boyars, greatly enhancing our local control."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_18_title:0 "Establish a General Staff"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_1_18_desc:0 "As our military grows in size, we also need a more robust command system to resolve issues of orders. We should establish a General Staff to manage the command of the entire army. This will increase our chances of victory on the battlefield and reduce unnecessary risks."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_8_title:0 "Gaze Upon the Black Sea"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_8_desc:0 "With our gradual military conquest of the Caucasus, it is time to set our sights upon the entire Black Sea. We shall seize the fertile lands of the Tatars on its northern shore. We will establish our first military stronghold on the Crimean coast to facilitate future control over the entire Black Sea."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_10_title:0 "The Cradle of Civilization"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_10_desc:0 "Human civilization has many concurrent birthplaces, but the fertile land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is among the most brilliant. With our conquest of Iraq, we turn our gaze here. Its rich farmlands and flat terrain will greatly aid our nation's food production."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_12_title:0 "Rule Africa"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_12_desc:0 "With our conquest of Tunisia, we have largely restored the territory of the Roman province of Africa. Now, we are once again the masters of Africa; those heathens have been expelled. It is time for us to turn our eyes towards distant Iberia."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_13_title:0 "Reestablish Caesarea" # Reestablish the Province of Caesarea
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_13_desc:0 "The Province of Caesarea was once home to Arabs and Berbers who believed in God. However, the arrival of Muhammad, the false prophet of the Muslims, shattered all this. The local people gradually turned to the false god under the Muslims' combination of favor and coercion. Now, we bring the Gospel of the Lord back here; this land is bathed in the holy light of God."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_15_title:0 "Reform the Banates"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_15_desc:0 "The Banate is a traditional primary-level administrative unit among the Slavs. However, this administrative unit is characterized by lag and antiquation. Local magnates have used the Banates to seize a series of improper benefits. We should reform the Banates to gradually modernize them."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_16_title:0 "Control the Nobility"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_16_desc:0 "In traditional medieval politics, the nobility could stabilize localities and provide revenue for the central authority. However, as times evolved, these highly autonomous entities gradually became an obstacle. We should employ various means to gradually reclaim and control the power of the nobility to strengthen centralization."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_17_title:0 "Imperial Military Group"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_2_17_desc:0 "With the continuous expansion of our territory and the ongoing improvement of centralization, we should strengthen the centralized construction of our military. We can establish an Imperial Military Group to command the entire army. This group will serve as our primary command organ, coordinating various subordinate forces and facilitating unified management."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_7_title:0 "The New Roman Empire"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_7_desc:0 "With our complete occupation of Greece and Anatolia, we proudly declare that we have largely restored the core territories of Eastern Rome. We shall proclaim ourselves as the New Roman Empire. The New Roman Empire will serve as the Spear of God, continuing to drive out the Turkic invaders and contend with the false Roman Church."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_8_title:0 "Expel the Turks"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_8_desc:0 "With our total control over Anatolia, we have completely driven the Turkic polities from the ancestral lands of the Romans. Now, all of Asia Minor is under our leadership. We should proceed to directly address the Turks in Asia Minor. We must expel them."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_9_title:0 "End Apostolic Church" # Dissolve the Apostolic Church
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_9_desc:0 "Since the Council of Chalcedon in 451, when Orthodox Christianity condemned the heretical Miaphysite doctrine, the local heretical believers in Armenia broke away from the oversight of the Orthodox Church, operating independently and calling themselves the so-called 'Armenian Apostolic Church.' With our complete control over Armenia, we should abolish this heretical church and bring them under the rule of the Orthodox Church."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_11_title:0 "Reclaim the East" # Reclaim the Eastern Territories
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_11_desc:0 "Since the death of the Great Emperor Justinian in 483, the Eastern Roman Empire had largely lost the lands of Egypt. With the subsequent rise of the heathens, the hope of reclaiming Egypt grew ever more distant. Today, we have set foot on this territory untouched by Romans for a millennium. The eastern territories of Rome are reclaimed."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_13_title:0 "Imperial Conquest"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_13_desc:0 "With the full restoration of our empire, we have achieved the greatest conquest in over a thousand years since the Great Schism between East and West Rome. From north to south, from west to east—Britannia, Gaul, Hispania, Germania, Italia—all should be united under the leadership of Rome's true successor."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_14_title:0 "Augustus"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_14_desc:0 "Finally, we have fulfilled the will of great Rome. We have fully reclaimed the ancient lands of Rome. Now, without a doubt, we shall crown ourselves as the new Augustus of Rome. The glory of the Roman Empire will endure. Rome, interrupted for a thousand years, will continue its legacy, forever."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_16_title:0 "Control the Clergy"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_16_desc:0 "Although the theocratic power of the traditional Orthodox Church, suppressed by imperial authority, is not as extensive as the clerical power in Western Europe, it still holds significant influence over the common people and politics. As the nation gradually modernizes, we should gradually diminish the voice of the clergy to enhance our centralization."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_17_title:0 "War Machine"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_3_17_desc:0 "'It was terrifying, truly,' were the first words he spoke to me when I saw that Janissary return alone. 'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger. There was nothing to be done; all depended on the mercy of Almighty Allah to save us. Those Bulgarians, they were like machines, one after another, devoid of emotion, reaping our heads like harvesting wheat.' — 'A History of the Bulgarian Wars', Ibrahim Süleyman"

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_7_title:0 "Unite the South Slavs"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_7_desc:0 "Now, with our conquest of the western Balkan Peninsula, all South Slavs are united under our banner. We can declare that Yugoslavia has been united as a single entity. We have truly achieved the unity of the South Slavs, both culturally and politically."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_9_title:0 "Slavic Autocracy"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_9_desc:0 "After unifying the entire Balkan Peninsula and Anatolia, our nation has expanded to an unprecedented scale. Now, we can be crowned as the Slavic Autocrat. We shall become the supreme ruler of the Slavs, uniting them under our dominion."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_10_title:0 "Restore the Levantine Coast"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_10_desc:0 "With our occupation of the traditional territories of the Eastern Roman Empire, it is time to set our sights on the lands of the Arabs. The Levantine coast was once an important source of stone for the Roman Empire. However, due to the rise of heathen faiths and the decline of Eastern Rome, it has long ceased to be Roman land. We shall reclaim it."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_1_title:0 "The Great Storm"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_1_desc:0 "With our occupation of southern Italy, we have swept through the land like a great storm. Now, it is time to commence our further conquest. We shall conquer all of Italy. As the legitimate heir of Rome, we will restore Rome and revive the Italian province."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_13_title:0 "The New Latin Church"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_13_desc:0 "With our occupation of all Italy, it is time to consider how to deal with the false Pope who uses his ecclesiastical authority to command the princes. We shall establish a New Latin Church here to govern all the people of the West. The Orthodox Church is finally unified, and Christianity is at last led under a single banner."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_15_title:0 "Control the Matica"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_15_desc:0 "The 'Matica' is a unique cultural association among the Slavs, which can be translated as a 'Cultural Society' or 'Academy.' These institutions gradually emerged during the modernization process and spread to various Slavic communities. Through the unified management of the Matica, we can greatly advance our cultural endeavors."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_16_title:0 "Discipline the Citizens"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_16_desc:0 "Citizens play a crucial role in our nation's political sphere. However, a lack of restraint can also lead to much chaos. We should impose discipline on the citizens to strengthen our political leadership."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_18_title:0 "Gold Lion on Surging Waves" # The Golden Lion upon the Surging Waves
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_4_18_desc:0 "As our territory continuously expands, our naval power has gradually increased. Now, without a doubt, we have grown into the premier naval power in Europe, even the world. Our navy, like a golden lion upon the surging waves, safeguards our merchant fleets and contributes to our expansion."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_6_title:0 "Reform the Regiments" # Reform the Regimental System
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_6_desc:0 "Our early armies lacked institutionalization and were under loose local management. As our nation's feudal structures gradually dissolve and centralization increases, we should reform our regimental system. By establishing a proper regimental system, we can effectively manage local forces and enhance our military strength."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_7_title:0 "Standardize the Standing Army"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_7_desc:0 "The standing army, as a post-medieval military force, is gradually becoming mainstream in our country. However, due to inconsistent recruitment and organization standards, leading to chaotic structures, we should now establish a comprehensive standing army system. This system will be tailored to meet our needs."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_8_title:0 "Imperial Iron Guard"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_8_desc:0 "As our imperial army becomes increasingly professionalized, we should forge an iron-willed, unyielding military force. We can select the Imperial Iron Guard from within the ranks to serve as our elite troops. This unit will play a major role, becoming an indispensable force."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_9_title:0 "Modern Training" # Modern Military Training
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_9_desc:0 "Entering the modern era, traditional methods of cold-weapon combat are gradually becoming obsolete. Our nation should also ride this wave and undertake modern military training. We must determine the focus of our training to forge a powerful Bulgarian-style army that will serve our expansion."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_11_title:0 "Invade Italy"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_11_desc:0 "With the enhancement of our naval power, it is time to consider invading Italy, the birthplace of Rome. Our ships are now sufficient to transport us continuously to the lands of Italy. We will reclaim Rome's ancestral territory, driving a nail into the heartland of the false Pope's rule."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_12_title:0 "The Eternal City"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_12_desc:0 "At last, we have occupied the eternal city of Rome. Now, the ancient capital of Rome is officially under our leadership. We have restored Rome, restored this great city. The ancient capitals of both Eastern and Western Rome are now united under our rule. We are the true successors of Rome."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_14_title:0 "Control the Church"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_14_desc:0 "The Church holds vast territories locally and controls significant tax revenues. We should gradually reclaim church lands and strengthen control over the Church to enhance our centralization. Through managing the Church, we can better serve our internal governance while also aiding our expansion."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_15_title:0 "Take Over the Patriarchate" # Take Over the Orthodox Church
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_15_desc:0 "With our complete occupation of the Balkans and Anatolia, and the thorough spread of religion, we can say that we control the entire Orthodox Church. Having a unified church leadership can increase our people's happiness and better legitimize our rule."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_17_title:0 "Citizen Conscription"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_17_desc:0 "Traditional free city citizens generally do not bear military service obligations. This, in fact, leads to a great waste of our human resources. We will enact legislation requiring city citizens to serve. In this way, our manpower can be replenished, making our expansion smoother."

EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_18_title:0 "The Trident"
EDG_MISSION_BUL_roma_5_18_desc:0 "Our naval doctrine is already highly advanced. Our naval tactics have reached world-class standards. Our navy is like a sharp trident, capable of pinning the enemy firmly ashore, daring them not to engage. Who can stand against the Bulgarian Trident?"
