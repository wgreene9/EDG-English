The forces of reaction, the noble landlords, are at their zenith. Should we choose to openly challenge the nobility, we would be met with overwhelming encirclement. Therefore, we must learn restraint and patience. A gentleman's revenge can wait ten years."

EDG_weimar_events.1_desc:0 "In the year 1346, Weimar established a republic with the aid of Bohemia. However, contrary to the people's hopes, this hastily formed First Republic was not the ideal like classical Athens of Greece. In truth, the First Republic was a transaction between the Czechs and the Weimar elite, serving only the privileged class, not the common people.\n\nAlthough the First Republic was essentially a noble state cloaked in republican garb, its founding still transmitted the ideal of republicanism to the poor toiling day and night in the fields. The people of Weimar never gave up pursuing this republican path.\n\nIn 1443, the Weimar Peasants' Revolt was crushed by Bohemia's Emperor Sigismund. The peasant leader, Thomas of Meissen, was executed. Since then, Weimar's republican and independence movements have been at a low ebb. The current Weimar Republic is merely a puppet of Bohemia, and the people remain far from true republicanism and the teachings of God."

EDG_weimar_events.3_desc:0 "Thomas of Meissen was born in 1408 in the Duchy of Meissen. Both his parents were merchants from Olarmund. At the age of 21, Thomas traveled alone to Bohemia to study theology at the University of Prague. It was during this period that he began to gradually come into contact with some Hussite 'heretical' ideas.\n\nOver the next five years, Thomas traveled throughout Bohemia, eventually settling in Skalitz. Perhaps because he had carefully studied Hussite doctrines, or perhaps simply because he was a devout Christian at heart, when Thomas learned of the Weimar peasants' plans to resist oppression by the Czech nobility, he almost immediately left Bohemia, returned to his homeland, and organized the peasant movement in the Thuringia region.\n\nAfter futile attempts to negotiate with the Church, Thomas was excommunicated, which directly pushed him into the Hussite camp. Although he never publicly converted to Hussitism, his actions and thoughts became almost indistinguishable from those of the Hussites.\n\nIn 1443, Emperor Sigismund decisively defeated Thomas's peasant army at Mühlhausen. The Weimar rebel forces were almost completely annihilated, and Thomas himself was publicly executed by Sigismund in Prague's town square on April 3rd at the ninth hour.\n\nAfter Thomas's death, fearing that Weimar might move towards independence, the Kingdom of Bohemia destroyed all records related to Thomas of Meissen, and even his name was forbidden to be spoken in public."

EDG_weimar_events.2_desc:0 "Since the failure of the uprising in 1440, the peasant movement throughout Thuringia has fallen into a lull. After Emperor Sigismund announced the withdrawal of Czech nobility from Weimar, more and more people began to genuinely pin their hopes on the current republican government. However, contrary to expectations, while the present Weimar Republic is no longer a puppet of the Czechs, it remains a plaything of oligarchs and the powerful.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Czechs, these local oligarchs swiftly filled the power vacuum, completely transforming the elected republican government into a tool for their own perpetual reelection. Political violence, power struggles, bribery, and murder—countless tragedies have played out repeatedly on Weimar's soil.\n\nMerchants, artisans, guilds, and peasants—these groups that constitute the vast majority of the republic's population hold the least voice within the country. Yet the oligarchs remain relentless. Not only have they failed to ease the exploitation of the people, they have instead colluded with the Czechs to hunt down remnants of the former rebel army, attempting to completely stifle the hopes of the common folk. However, these self-proclaimed nobles have forgotten the most crucial truth: where there is oppression, there will be resistance.\n\nIn Olarmund, the vital northern trade hub of Weimar, the people, having long endured the world's hardships, have decided to risk everything. They once rallied under the banner of Thomas of Meissen, and after Thomas's execution, that banner did not vanish. Instead, it flies once more above the church of Olarmund.\n\nBy the time the lords in their castles realized something was amiss, the spark had already become a wildfire. Weimar is free once again!"

When people look out their windows, all they see are the banners of Bohemia, Mainz, Brandenburg, and various noble princes fluttering in the air. Yet when they turn their disappointed gaze away from the windowsill, they are met only with endless quarrels among their own compatriots indoors.\n\nAlthough the Olarmund rebels overthrew the old oligarchy, the rebel forces themselves are far from united. Faced with the overwhelming encirclement of reactionary noble forces both at home and abroad, some rebels, seeing no chance of victory, seek compromise with the reactionary nobility. Others, opportunistic fence-sitters, intend to defect, trading the betrayal of their brethren for personal wealth and glory.\n\nPerhaps in just a few more days, the leaderless rebel forces would collapse on their own. Days of thunderstorms have unsettled the people. Lost and without guidance, the people of Weimar pray day and night in the churches, longing for the advent of Christ the Savior. But how can the sacred icons speak? Mournful dirges echo over Weimar, unable to find rest.\n\nAnother clap of thunder startles a baby in its mother's arms. When people look out the window again, the first thing they see is not the dark mass of an army, but a slender figure moving slowly towards the church through the curtain of rain.\n\n'I see him!' a nun cries out.\n\n'It's Thomas, Thomas has returned!'"

While they could be defeated one by one, doing so would inevitably provoke retaliation from the surrounding major nobles."\n\nWiping water from his head, Thomas moved pieces on the map, simulating various scenarios before concluding: "Compatriots, I must say, the current situation... is far from optimistic. We are encircled in the middle, and the only possible breakthrough point is—"\n\nA clap of thunder interrupted him. Thomas seemed to sense something and turned to look at the stunned crowd behind him. "What's wrong with you all? Have the noble lords frightened you senseless? Why is everyone so quiet today?"\n\nAt this, a veteran rebel soldier suddenly knelt, gasping for breath: "I've followed you since the Thuringian War. After... Mühlhausen, we all thought you had gone to Heaven. But here you are now... I'm not afraid of the lords in their stone castles. I just can't believe... the miracle. You've returned from the dead!" His words drew murmurs of agreement from others; some of the more timid even fainted on the spot.\n\nThomas sighed helplessly, bent down, and helped the old soldier up: "I remember you, Bernhard. You are a good soldier and a devout Christian. And you are right—Christ the Savior has indeed granted me a second chance. There's no need for such astonishment, for wherever you are, the Lord always loves you..."\n\nThomas patted the veteran's shoulder, then turned sideways and addressed the crowd, many of whom were making gestures of prayer: "No one is born a warrior, but now we must fight!

Beyond the inherent freshness of rain-soaked earth, he caught a faint, coppery scent—a lingering trace, perhaps, of spilled blood.\n\nRain can cleanse the soil, but it cannot wash away the blood of the Weimar people.\n\nSlowly closing his eyes, Thomas swore to the merciful Lord and to the countless weeping people of Weimar: he would fight for this land, for freedom..."

No, we do not want the same to happen to the people of Weimar.\n\nWhen war chariots no longer stand guard for the powerful;\nWhen our lads no longer march for politicians who start wars;\nThen Germany will have freedom and beauty.\nWhen East and West stand united, and the banner of peace flies high, then Germany will have prosperity and glory."

Yet in the eyes of the numerous North Germans, the rebellion by the southern clergy was even more incomprehensible.\n\nThe southerners were wealthier than the northerners, yet they remained unsatisfied. Instead of offering this extra wealth to those truly in need, they grew even more avaricious, discriminating against northerners while secretly funneling more money into their own pockets.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps because this stab-in-the-back betrayal fueled North German anger, on the journey to Weimar's capital, Wagner's carriage was smashed to pieces by a boulder that appeared from nowhere.
