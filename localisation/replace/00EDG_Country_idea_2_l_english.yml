We should lead our diligent people in agricultural work on our fertile lands. When granaries along the canals overflow with successive harvests, an era free from famine and poverty will dawn."
EDG_YIN_5:0 "Govern All States"
EDG_YIN_5_desc:0 "We firmly believe that governing according to the sages' teachings - educating people with benevolence, rites, loyalty and trust, while encouraging officials with diligence, integrity, and justice - will surely create a prosperous age of Great Unity under Heaven."
EDG_YIN_6:0 "Neo-Confucian Reform"
EDG_YIN_6_desc:0 "Neo-Confucianism, also known as Dao Learning, emerged as the primary philosophical school during the Song dynasties. Its concept of Heavenly Principle formed a moral theology that also legitimized imperial authority. However, as Neo-Confucianism grew increasingly rigid while economy and society advanced, calls for reform grew louder. Through discussions between official and private Dao Learning scholars, a new Neo-Confucianism incorporating multiple schools ultimately became Dayin's guiding ideology."
EDG_YIN_7:0 "Guard the Four Barbarians"
EDG_YIN_7_desc:0 "Wars against surrounding minority peoples have never brought true peace to Central Plain dynasties. The great conquerors' promises of eternal security through single campaigns have never been fulfilled. Only by educating the four barbarians through prestige and virtue, making them protective barriers of Huaxia, can lasting peace be achieved."
