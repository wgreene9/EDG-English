Soon, they raised banners of rebellion demanding the enfeebled §YBavand§! abdicate. Though the §YBavand§! would not yield passively, what could they do? The weakened dynasty could only offer temporary concessions, granting more privileges to the other nobles. But how long would this last? Inflated ambitions would inevitably lead to open rebellion. After days of preparation, an absurd §Rcivil war§! among the §YSix Great Nobles§! erupted: they raised armies against each other, carved cities into fiefdoms, and with every action further devastated the war-torn land, while the §YBavand§! could only watch, seeking to minimize the damage. Meanwhile, the Ulema amassed wealth in mosques, officials counted ill-gotten gains in courtyards, and soldiers plundered their own people in the countryside. The once-mighty Sassanid Empire, ravaged by internal strife and external threats, now held only §Mtwo cities§!. Outsiders forgot we were the great §YSassanid Heirs§!, calling us merely §YMazandaran§!.\n\n§MWhen did the rationale for seizing power shift from challenging ruler's legitimacy to coveting the supreme position itself? Where is Mazandaran's glimmer of hope?§! The flame of the Sassanid heirs—who once rivaled Rome for over 700 years—grows ever dimmer, vulnerable to being extinguished by the slightest breath...\n\n§M1429§!: §YThe Rekindled Sacred Fire of Muzaffar§!, §RThe Eternal Flame§!\nBy §Y1409§!, the §MBavand Dynasty§! had reestablished control over all §YMazandaran§! lands, though internal discontent persisted—nobles still feuded, and the realm remained unstable. Yet for commoners, having relative peace was blessing enough. However, to stabilize the realm and bowing to Ulema pressure, the Karen family granted excessive power to the §GUlema§!, who became the de facto rulers. To satisfy their greed, the Ulema imposed heavier taxes, pushing already struggling citizens deeper into despair.\nDuring an outing, the Shah witnessed local officials brutally extorting taxes: emaciated people trudged forward to surrender their few coins. When Shah §MKamal al-Din§! intervened, officials rebuffed him with §G\"This is Allah's will\"§!. He watched citizens numbly hand possessions to mosques, then collapse upon turning away, their fingers pointing at the gaunt, queueing masses.\n\nFacing this, the Shah first doubted his rule's legitimacy and faith.\nIn §Y1429§!, in §Msouthern Khorasan§!, once-subjugated §RZoroastrians§! seized power from the Muzaffar governor, establishing a §RZoroastrian§! state. Both ruler and commoners beheld—not with eyes but with fervor—the undying sacred fire. Memories of the land's ancient faith resurfaced, guiding them back to §RAhura Mazda's§! embrace. For Iran's §RZoroastrians§!, hope seemed reborn. Crypto-Zoroastrians resumed fire rituals, praying for a savior to expel §GMuslims§! from Iran.\nAfter his disillusionment with the Ulema, Shah §MKamal al-Din§! reconnected with Zoroastrian priests, praying nightly for the flame's return. Yet he knew: until he could secure survival and reclaim royal authority from the Ulema, he must §Yfeign§! pious Islamic faith and co-rule with them.\n\n§MNovember 11, 1444§!: §YThe Clandestine City Fires§!, §RIlluminating the Path Forward§!\nThis is the year of greatness. Though the Ulema's public influence remained strong—people still recited the Quran and attended prayers—their actual sway had faded to a fraction. At night, households gathered spontaneously, kindling sacred fires and using scavenged Zoroastrian texts for worship. Though the Ulema grew suspicious, lacking proof of apostasy, they could only relent—yet their doubts festered, driving them to seek evidence to maintain control."


EDG_string_start_BDX:0 "§OThe Mir Muhammad and the Argead Dynasty§!\n§YBadakhshan§! is a remote principality nestled in a corner of the Hindu Kush. Its ruler is titled §YMir§!. The current Mir, §YSultan Muhammad§!, is said to be a descendant of §YAlexander the Great§!, and his family is the sole surviving lineage of the §YArgead Dynasty§! that once ruled the §YMacedonian Empire§!. Muhammad and his son §YIskandar§! have long ruled this distant land with benevolence, yet they have never abandoned the dream of restoring the glory of the House of Argead.\n\n§OBadakshan§!\n§YBadakshan§! is famed for producing a ruby known as 'Balas,' renowned for its dazzling crimson hue. Merchants transport these rubies along the 'Ruby Road,' part of the Silk Road, selling them across the world.\nAs a crossroads of Asia, Badakshan commands the juncture of Iran-Turan, the Indian subcontinent, and the East. Yet, surrounded by mountains, it remains isolated, fostering an exceptionally diverse and complex array of religious and cultural communities. The Indo-Aryan ancestors of the Badakhshani people followed Zoroaster into the faith of §YZoroastrianism§!. During Alexander the Great's eastern campaigns, Badakhshan was incorporated into the §YGreco-Bactrian Kingdom§!, undergoing a prolonged period of §YHellenization§!. Under the influence of the Mauryan Empire, many Bactrians converted to §YBuddhism§!, which remained the dominant faith in Badakhshan for over a millennium. After conquest by the Caliphate, though Buddhists were granted 'dhimmi' status, Buddhism inevitably declined. The ancestors of Mir [Root.Monarch.GetName] converted to the §YSunni§! branch of Islam during this process. In the 11th century AD, the Fatimid §YIsmaili§! scholar §YNasir Khusraw§! came to Badakhshan as a missionary, establishing a resilient Ismaili community that gradually became predominant. With the westward migration of the §YKerait-Naiman tribes§! and the conversion of the §YKartids§!, Badakhshan's religious landscape was further impacted by §YNestorian Christianity§!.\n\n§OThe Timurid Yoke§!\nBadakhshan has long been subservient to the powerful §YTimurid Empire§!. The Mir of Badakhshan secured his realm against invasion by presenting Timurid rulers with tributes of rubies. It is rumored that Timurid Sultan §YShah Rukh§! is nearing his end, yet the succession remains unresolved. A great conspiracy brews in Samarkand. Meanwhile, to the north on the steppes, the Uzbek Khanate's §YAbu'l-Khayr Khan§! watches intently, waiting for his moment. In this conflict, Badakhshan cannot remain untouched. Perhaps the perfect opportunity to break free from the Timurid yoke has arrived..."


EDG_string_start_HOL:0 "§MThe Shadow of Rome and the Awakening of the Low Countries§!\nEven before Roman legions set foot north of the Rhine, the Low Countries were already a land of contradictions—fertile yet perilous, open yet fragmented. Its inhabitants, the Batavi and Frisii, eked out a living amidst tides and marshes, trading with Rome yet repeatedly rebelling. As the Empire declined and Frankish cavalry swept through, the Low Countries found not unity, but deeper entanglement in feudal fragmentation.\n\nBy the 9th century, Viking longships ravaged along the rivers, while Holy Roman Emperors showed little interest in this peripheral region. Thus, the Low Countries became a chessboard for princes: the Count of Flanders grew rich on wool, the Duke of Brabant wavered between Empire and France, and the County of Holland struggled to survive floods and internal strife. Division seemed the destiny of the Low Countries.\n\n§MThe 15th Century: Merchants, Counts, and the Specter of Republic§!\nIn 1444, the County of Holland teetered on the brink. Count Willem V was frail and ill, the treasury empty, nobles vied for power, while merchants in the cities watched coldly—long weary of feudal lords' endless wars and foolish taxes.\n\nIn Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leiden, a new force was rising: the Republicans. They were not knights or clergy, but bankers, shipowners, and guild leaders. Their weapons were not spears, but ledgers; their faith was not in God, but in profit. They dreamed of a realm ruled by merchants, a republic that would reshape Europe with gold, not steel.\n\n"Why must we bow to the Empire? Why must we pay for the electors' vanity?" Republican leader Jan van der Velde demanded at secret gatherings. "The wealth of the Low Countries belongs to its people, and the world shall belong to gold."\n\n§MLeveraging a Feather? The Fantasy of a Merchant Republic§!\nThe Republicans' plan bordered on madness: they would control princes with loans, replace feudal allegiance with guild alliances, even envisioning a "commercial federation"—a union of cities governed by council, armies of mercenaries, and decisions of war or peace dictated by profit. Yet reality was far harsher than ideals. The princes of the Holy Roman Empire would not tolerate merchants overstepping, and the Papacy would deem this heresy. Could the Republicans succeed? Perhaps a brief victory would be followed by fiercer suppression. Or perhaps, like the later Dutch Republic, they would tear open a new era through baptism in blood and gold."
