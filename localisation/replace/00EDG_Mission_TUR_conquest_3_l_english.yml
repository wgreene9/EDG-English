EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The 15th and 16th centuries were the 'Age of the Thistle,' a period of immense pride for the Scots. During this era, they surged forward with astonishing speed, establishing the vast, economically prosperous, and socially progressive Britannic Colonial Empire. Their capital, Lothian, was a hub of international trade and the industrial heart of Britannia. However, the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] will allow its prosperity to continue no longer; it shall be replaced by mountains of white bones."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_1_5_desc:0 "After the fall of South Germany, the various princes of North Germany cling on desperately. They believe North Germany is where Augustus met his defeat, that the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] is exhausted and weary after conquering South Germany, that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is destined to become the next Varus, and that the Germans will seize the chance to counterattack. These Germanic barbarians know nothing of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Let them have an 'open-hearted' conversation with our blades and correct their views."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_1_7_desc:0 "Since the Mauryan Empire, the feat of unifying India under a single banner has never been achieved. However, we Turks are not the weak and incompetent Indians. Our dreams are ambitious, our armies are high-spirited, our machinery is world-leading, and the Indians are destined to grovel before us. All of Hindustan shall be under our rule."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_1_8_title:0 "Pacify Burma"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_1_8_desc:0 "Beyond the Arakan Mountains lies a land rich in minerals and gems. Burma is no hospitable region; it is the home of the warlike Shan and Burman peoples, who have been fighting each other for centuries. But our Gazi warriors will pay no heed to these infidels. Let us conquer this barrier of India!"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_1_title:0 "Death Comes Calling"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_1_desc:0 "The wickedness and cunning of the Britons are self-evident. These infidels excel at interfering in the internal affairs of the entire world, acting as pirates to plunder the oceans, disrupting our trade, and attacking our ports. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] harbors a deep hatred for them and proclaims to the Islamic world the launch of a new Jihad against Britain."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_2_title:0 "Thunder Over London"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_2_desc:0 "The Tower of London seemed to awaken sleeping souls in the thunderstorm. Rain cascaded like waterfalls from the battlements, tracing thousands of meandering trails on the arrow-slit windows. The pale walls of the White Tower turned ghostly white for an instant as lightning flashed, then sank back into deeper darkness. The Thames' murky surface was ignited again and again by lightning, reflecting the jagged silhouettes of the towers as if ghosts were rising from the riverbed.\n\nThe midnight bells became fragmented within the thunder but startled the slumbering ravens. They circled above the towers, their hoarse cries blending with the wind into an ancient chorus. Every corner of the Tower of London now whispered the most secret tales beneath the British crown. As the final bolt of lightning streaked across the sky, illuminating the gilded weathervane atop the tower, its window seemed to gaze upon the [236.GetName] in the downpour—a city it had guarded for centuries, now fallen into Turkish hands."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_3_desc:0 "The British Isles are now wholly incorporated into our empire, an achievement never accomplished by Julius Caesar or Augustus. We shall bind the Celts and Anglo-Saxons, utilizing their excellent maritime traditions to bring the New World into our empire."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Since the Nicopolis Crusade, the Germans should have been prepared to pay the price for invading us. The [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] shall personally toll the death knell for Alamannia."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_5_title:0 "Destroy South Germany"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_5_desc:0 "The Battle of Vienna did not extinguish the Habsburgs' ambition for power. Under the false name of the Roman Empire, they shamelessly used family ties to attempt forming a coalition against us. This farce is merely a combination of bleak reality and absurd delusion. We will show no further mercy to these Germanic barbarians; the Kapıkulu shall destroy and dissolve this hollow ideal."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_6_title:0 "The Calamity of Alamannia"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_6_desc:0 "Our hatred for the Germanic peoples runs deep in our bones. They have vilified our nation's image, militarily invaded our territory, and infiltrated and sabotaged our economy. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] despises them utterly. Now, the seat of power of the false Roman Empire is fully in our hands. Our Jihad has achieved a glorious victory. Let the Gazi warriors sheathe their swords no more today; today is the day of calamity for the Germans!"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_8_title:0 "The Falling of the Datura"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_8_desc:0 "Moonlight shattered into silver on the Mekong River. When the first datura petal fell, it carried an unnatural, sweet, fishy scent, descending vertically and slowly, like a silently lowered flag.\n\nThen the entire plant began to tremble.\n\nMore white petals fluttered down, covering the smiling stone carvings of the ancient temple, the emerald green seedlings in the rice fields, and the ruts on what was once the royal road. Wherever the petals touched, color quietly faded—the orange of monks' robes, the hues of looms, the verdant green of palm leaves—all gradually blended into a monochrome gray-white.\n\nSome petals curled at the edges, taking on a metallic golden hue, as if scorched by invisible flames. The sweet fragrance in the air grew intense and pungent, mixed with the scent of unfamiliar smoke and dust. When the last petal touched the ground, it did not decay but hardened into a silver coin, gleaming coldly under the moonlight.\n\nThe remaining branches stood bare, like skeletons stripped of flesh, still pointing towards the sky in twisted postures. In the silence, only distant, unfamiliar bells echoed, each chime measuring the silence of this land."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_9_title:0 "The Fall of Indonesia"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_2_9_desc:0 "Indonesia is now a prosperous commercial hub between East and West. Since we have established more direct connections with this trade network through acquiring Southeast Asian ports, it is only natural for us to seek a headquarters locally, allowing us to control and tax the traffic. Malacca is, in many ways, our ideal operational base. Let us introduce this idea to the Malaccans themselves."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_3_2_desc:0 "From Charles Martel to Charlemagne, the damned Carolingians blocked the northward advance of the Muslim world time and again, preventing the light of Allah from crossing the Pyrenees. Yet perhaps as karma dictates, the last descendants of the Carolingians eventually lost most of their domains, huddled in a corner of Lotharingia, anxiously awaiting the day of judgment. We should nail shut the lid of Lothair's coffin, drawing the final line on the Islamic-Frankish conflict that began with the Battle of Tours a millennium ago."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_3_5_title:0 "Pasha of the Intermarum"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_3_5_desc:0 "The lands between the seas, from the Baltic to the Polish plains, were once within the sphere of influence of the Jagiellonian Empire. But this short-lived empire was cut down by Mehmed 'the Conqueror' at the Battle of Varna, and the region is now the domain of the eastward-expanding Germans. Undoubtedly, our loathing for the Germans runs deep in our bones, and no matter where they flee, they cannot escape the grasp of the Turkish Empire! Let us shatter the eastern frontier of the Teutonic Kingdom and establish our own Pasha of the Intermarum."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_3_8_desc:0 "Our recent expansion has brought us to the borders of the Chinese Empire. This Middle Kingdom was once a distant, unreachable giant. China practices a stable, centralized system; a nation with wealth and population comparable to the entire Indian subcontinent has always remained unified, while India has been perpetually fragmented and divided.\n\nThe Chinese seem unwilling to engage with us on our terms, but we cannot tolerate them dictating to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the great [Root.GetName] Empire. Let us teach this ancient empire a lesson and see how far our nascent state can reach..."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_1_desc:0 "The damned Franks have participated in almost every Crusade against the Islamic world. Their empires were built upon the blood of Muslims, and the weak Andalusian emirs never avenged the shame of the Battle of Tours. But the Ottoman Empire is beyond comparison with the later Umayyads. We are true conquerors. For centuries, we have unified beys, ruled Rum, extinguished the Byzantine Emperor, conquered Egypt, campaigned against Persia, shattered the Holy Roman Empire, subjugated the Latins, defeated the nomads, and pacified the seas. The Franks are merely the next nation destined to fall beneath the empire's sabers. We shall bring doom to the Franks; their villages will burn, their subjects will wail, their churches will be destroyed, and their nation will be obliterated!"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_2_desc:0 "After the Albigensian Crusade, the nascent Kingdom of Arles flourished for a time, even presuming to be the successor of the Franks. However, the revival of the Capetian dynasty, the wars in Iberia, and the centralization of the Holy Roman Empire plunged it into a quagmire. The Cathars, with their heretical beliefs, are not well-received by mainstream Christians. Perhaps the [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could serve as their protector—on the condition they acknowledge the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as also the Lord of Arles."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_3_desc:0 "Throughout history, the French have often assimilated other peoples, forcibly imposing the French language, from the Bretons to the Occitans, to the Aquitanians, the Burgundians... But ironically, today the [Root.GovernmentName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will transform them into Muslims assimilated by us, letting them also taste the flavor of being absorbed."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_4_title:0 "The Day of Cataclysm"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_4_desc:0 "The Russo-Turkish Wars refer to a series of conflicts between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire from the 16th to the 18th centuries over the Caucasus, the Balkans, Crimea, the Black Sea, etc., with ten major wars among them. Under the banners of 'saving Christians oppressed by the Turkish Empire' and 'protecting Slavic brothers,' the Tsarist government sought to consolidate its influence in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Black Sea region, repeatedly and actively violating Ottoman frontiers, though with little notable success. The wars between Russia and Turkey stretched intermittently over 241 years, averaging less than 19 years between major conflicts, making it the longest series of wars in European history. Now that we have freed our hands from the southern campaigns, it is time to bring ultimate cataclysm to these Rus' who only know how to stab us in the back."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_5_desc:0 "Ruthenia is dead. On the day it died, the Metropolitan of Kiev wailed helplessly to the heavens; the Grand Prince of Vladimir drew his sword and looked around in despair; snow and ice swirled across the Rus' lands. Row upon row of Cossacks fell before the Janissaries' muskets; line after line of streltsy turned to dust before the heavy cannons. The dream of a revived Kievan Rus', briefly kindled after Ivan I, was finally shattered once more by reality."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_3_mission_4_8_desc:0 "Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was indeed a hero for an age. However, we also note that vast swathes of the Mongol Empire were acquired after his death. Yet every [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] has gained more territory and subjects than Genghis Khan achieved in his lifetime. Now, we rule an empire stretching from Andalusia in the west to Cathay in the east, vaster than the Mongol Empire itself, making us more legendary than Temüjin himself!"

But the sabers of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName] have proven these to be nothing but arrogant delusions.

From Charles Martel to Louis IX, from Hugh VII to Francis I, they have harbored hostility towards Muslim nations, even launching multiple crusades against the Islamic world. Now, their proud capital, Paris, has fallen into the Empire's hands. We shall be crowned Caliph of Farasastan and drink the sweet blood of Paris."

In contrast, the Rus' barbarians, relying solely on so-called Orthodox faith and a single royal marriage, arrogantly attempt to claim the legacy of a great empire. It is laughable. And now these insolent upstarts shall pay the price.
