The central Iberian region and parts of the western coast are inhabited by native Mozarabic Christians, and remnants of Mozarabism persist in the Aragonese mountains due to the Kingdom of Aragon's fragmentation. Influenced by Arles, the Catalan Republic converted to Catharism, making it the mainstream religion in northeastern Iberia.

Around 786 AD, the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Rahman I sought to make Córdoba a great religious center to rival the East. He converted a Roman and Visigothic church into this mosque. Later expanded by Abd al-Rahman II and Al-Hakam II, by 1236 the mosque's area had tripled compared to its initial construction, capable of accommodating over 20,000 worshippers at once.\n\nDuring the reign of Caliph Hisham II, the vizier Al-Mansur expanded the prayer hall. By the time of Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, construction reached its zenith. Despite multiple expansions, the architectural style and characteristics remained unchanged, only growing in scale and richness of decoration.\n\nHowever, during the Reconquista, prolonged warfare caused the city's development to stagnate.

Their objective was not to sail directly to Egypt, but to capture Tunis as a springboard for attacking Egypt.\n\nWhen the lookouts of Tunis saw endless sails approaching from the north, they never imagined they would become the target of a Christian landing. The garrison, after putting up symbolic resistance, was driven from the city. The governor of Tunis, Abu Zakariya Yahya, was captured. His brother, Abdallah, gathered remnants of the army, occupied Kairouan, and confronted the Crusaders within Tunis, while appealing for aid from the Almohad Caliph. However, deeply mired in the Moroccan quagmire, the Almohads provided little substantial assistance beyond dispatching a small force of over a thousand men. In their eyes, the Hafsids entrenched in Tunis were as detestable as the Crusaders, and they adopted a largely wait-and-see attitude.\n\nIn the winter of 1121, Kairouan fell. The Great Mosque within the city was thoroughly looted by the Crusaders, and the spiritual heart of North African Muslims now flew Christian banners. This was undoubtedly a significant victory for Christendom.\n\nIn [GetYear], the armies of [Root.GetName] breached the walls of Tunis. The Crusaders formally surrendered to [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName], marking the final cleansing of Crusader presence in North Africa after two centuries by Muslim forces.

By the time rulers truly began to address the issue, the ravaged agricultural landscape within Iberia had become an undeniable reality, and domestic agricultural production was hanging by a thread.\n\nThe arrival of a great drought then completely shattered agricultural production in the Iberian region.

Dissatisfaction among the domestic Muslim population and the upper class with the rule of [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has intensified. Without state intervention, this discontent has transformed into protests and uprisings.\n\nTo uphold orthodox faith, classes and masses across various Muslim communities have revolted, demanding the state reduce privileges granted to non-Muslims and strengthen religious unity. The dhimmi class, representing various non-Muslim faiths, stands with [Root.Monarch.GetName], urging the preservation of current policies and suppression of protests from Muslim classes. Thus, a peculiar scene has emerged within [Root.GetName]: supporters of orthodox faith have become opponents of the state government, while non-Muslims have instead become supporters of state rule.\n\nSmall-scale conflicts across various regions of [Root.GetName] finally escalated into a religious conflict engulfing the entire [Root.GetName] in [GetYear]. A fanatical Taifa governing the Córdoba region of Iberia declared that [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had betrayed Allah and openly rebelled.

FOIDisasterEvents.170.name:0 "Heat Wave"
FOIDisasterEvents.170.desc:0 "The religious issue within the Union has always been a troublesome one. Catharism, a heresy spread to the Iberian Peninsula, saw its adherents expand during Catalonia's unification of Iberia, yet it never became a mainstream faith. Most people in the north adhered to Roman Catholicism, the central regions were dominated by the native Spanish church, while the south was long ruled by Islam. Catharism remained largely confined to Catalonia, a situation not easily altered. Its distribution within the Union was sparse, and it remained a non-dominant religion for a long time, sowing the seeds for future turmoil.\n\nAlthough the Union had an overarching religious policy, not every commune adhered to the standards set by the Congress, as implementation difficulty varied with the demographic base of other believers. Thus, while the Union nominally had an official state religion, the actual distribution of mainstream faiths across regions saw little significant change. Instead, increased mobility and exchange between adjacent communes further complicated religious communities.\n\nBefore the Reformation, tensions existed among followers of different religions within the Union. However, individual communes possessed the capacity and were accustomed to handling such matters, preventing them from becoming a significant problem for the Union. Yet, the sweeping Reformation movement acted as a magnifying glass on the Union's religious issues.\n\nWith the progress of the Reformation, Protestant teachings reached the Iberian Peninsula. Mainstream religions shifted in some regions, and the number of Protestants began to increase across various areas, causing dramatic changes in the Union's religious distribution. Simultaneously, more heresies emerged, further fueling religious discord. The fault lines of religious division now extended beyond traditional binary conflicts. Uncontrolled religious fanatics appeared across the Union, and religious conflicts infiltrated the political administration of various communes while exacerbating cultural and ethnic tensions. Religious fervor, driven by the Reformation and deep-seated divisions within the Union, led to a series of rebellions and uprisings. Followers of different religious sects sought to preserve their original rights and ensure their supreme doctrines remained untouched by adherents of other faiths, while some fanatics attempted to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nCurrently, the state of religious communities across the Union is characterized by fanaticism, violence, persecution, and wanton destruction of religious sites. Local communes are overwhelmed by such large-scale religious turmoil and are calling on the Congress to make a decision to definitively end the religious dilemma that has existed since the nation's founding: pluralistic coexistence or a single faith. However, before beginning, we must first determine our stance in this sweeping Reformation—in what form the Union shall continue forward."

FOIDisasterEvents.190.desc:0 "The Military Commission was originally tasked with the vital mission of enhancing the Union's military capabilities, a duty it performed with commendable efficiency at its inception. Its establishment yielded substantial results, genuinely strengthening the nation's military organization and combat effectiveness. Meanwhile, as the Commission's status and influence grew, its original responsibilities gradually eroded under the trials of war, paving the way for corrupt reactionary forces to take root within.\n\nDue to continuous warfare, the Union's demand for military force increased dramatically. Unlike other reactionary states, the Union had virtually no potential external military aid, leading to the nation's progressive militarization. The need for a powerful army, coupled with the ideal of exporting revolution and the dilemmas faced in reality, allowed a decaying condition to quietly spread amidst the flames of revolution. As the military expanded, the Military Commission gained unprecedented power and influence. This newfound authority, combined with the temptation of absolute control, proved a potent catalyst for the Commission's leadership. Ultimately, they succumbed to the lure of unchecked power, nurturing ambitions beyond their initial mandate.\n\nFrom its outset, the structure of the Military Commission made it impossible for the Congress to impose rigid constraints; the central authority lacked coercive means to counter it. This fostered the gradual entrenchment of corruption within its corridors. The absence of strong oversight mechanisms, alongside the Commission's centralized and increasingly oligarchic power, provided opportunities for greedy reactionaries to foster self-serving agendas and manipulate the system for personal gain.\n\nAs the vines of corruption entwined the Commission, the character of its leadership underwent a noticeable transformation. This institution, once driven by commitment to national defense and revolutionary ideals, became a clique of individuals craving further authority and power. This transformation culminated at a critical moment when the Commission's leaders, tempted by absolute power, made a fatal decision to orchestrate a coup against the Congress.\n\nThe coup did not succeed. Congress members immediately relocated, declared a state of emergency, and proclaimed the Military Commission an illegal organization, mobilizing communal forces to suppress it. As orders were not instantly transmitted everywhere and loyalist factions within the Military Commission still existed, the nation entered a civil war phase. However, local militias and rebel forces continuously contested control of various communes, resulting in a complex, interwoven situation.\n\nThe vibrant crimson flames of this revolution neither burned brighter nor dissipated; instead, they grew listless, like ghostly will-o'-the-wisps. Can the Union rekindle this dead fire—or will it be consumed, releasing these wandering flames to poison this revolutionary soil?"

FOI_UCIEvents.0.desc:0 "A century after Peter II's patronage of the Cathars, Cathar communities migrated south along the coastline to Catalonia. As Cathar communities were established and Catharism's inherent appeal to the lower classes oppressed by Catholicism grew, Catalonia gradually turned to the Cathar camp over decades. After years of conflict, Cathar believers finally dominated Catalonia, and with the fall of the Kingdom of Aragon, a republic was established by the will of the people at this most important Cathar stronghold in Iberia and a key site for the European Cathar movement.\n\nSituated in the southeastern part of Iberia and pursuing a pro-Arles policy, the Catalan Republic was largely untouched by the fires of war on the peninsula. Yet this did not mean the fledgling republic would refrain from conquest. Decades after King Ignacio III of Asturias launched his crusade against Tulaytulah, reigniting Iberia's blazing flames, this new Cathar republic proclaimed to the world the unification of Iberia.\n\nHowever, events did not unfold as the republic anticipated. What greeted unification was not public jubilation but an unprecedented famine. The barren Iberian Peninsula restricted agricultural activities, resulting in a weak agricultural foundation. Coupled with centuries of Reconquista warfare, which destroyed much of the agricultural and artisanal infrastructure built during peacetime, the situation worsened.\n\nMaking matters worse, the republican government was already riddled with corruption. Due to excessive reliance on Arles' assistance during the unification war, the republic signed a series of treaties that sold out national interests. While these treaties were barely sustainable in the past, the Iberian famine shattered the republic's finances. The Kingdom of Arles would not miss this opportunity, pressing for the implementation of previous treaties while seeking further control over the republic.\n\nFiscal deficits led the republic to a ruinous decision: further taxing peasants already devastated by famine. Such an unpopular policy naturally faced strong opposition across regions. To stabilize the nation, the republic decided to request Arles' military intervention to suppress rebellions. This move ignited the fury of the middle and lower classes. The republic, once established to protect the people, had become an instrument of their persecution, sparking a massive uprising across Iberia.\n\nWith experience seceding from the Kingdom of Aragon, this great uprising initially focused on Catalonia. The middle and lower classes, already scarred by the Iberian wars, had lost all trust in the government, believing no state institution could grant them true freedom. An unprecedented 'libertarian' ideology rapidly spread from Catalonia, aiming to establish a fully free society where everyone has dignity. Under normal circumstances, such radical ideas would not have spread so widely, but in turbulent Iberia, they gained broad support among the lower classes. Soon, angry crowds seized Barcelona, demanding the dissolution of the current government. Such absurdity was naturally rejected by the republic, but uprisings elsewhere left republican leaders fearing for their safety, choosing to flee to the Kingdom of Arles.\n\nAt this moment, Catalonia has become a nominal 'hollow republic,' and now the people must make their choice."
