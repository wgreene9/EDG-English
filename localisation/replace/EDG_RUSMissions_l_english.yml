EDG_RUS_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The Baltic Sea is a crucial trade nexus, serving as the economic lifeline for Poland, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as Russia's window to the outside world. Russia must not be left behind by other European nations. Enhancing our military power projection in the Baltic will be vital for the Motherland's cause."

EDG_RUS_mission_1_3_title:0 "Expel the Crusaders"
EDG_RUS_mission_1_3_desc:0 "Due to the negligence of the Polish King, from Pruthenia to the Chud lands, German crusaders have invaded the Baltic like locusts, barbarically enslaving and oppressing the Baltic peoples for centuries, and now aim to shift their aggression to our Orthodox brethren. These Germans have impudently offended the Tsar's majesty, and the Tsar cannot tolerate such acts unfolding before Russia's eyes. Now, let these false crusaders pay for their deeds!"

EDG_RUS_mission_1_6_title:0 "Protect the Baltic"
EDG_RUS_mission_1_6_desc:0 "A powerful Russia has helped the Baltic peoples expel the greedy and tyrannical false crusaders and profit-seeking clergy, has taught the Lithuanian Orthodox Church, which has long admired Rus' culture, the true path, and has assisted the oppressed Livonian people in rebuilding their government. Over the Baltic's icy seas now waft hopes for the future and joy for unity. The great Mother Russia will protect the weaker Baltic nations, patiently educate them, and resolve their issues of faith and identity."

EDG_RUS_mission_1_8_title:0 "Take Over Finland"
EDG_RUS_mission_1_8_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Sweden has been a threat at the Rus' people's doorstep for centuries. They are direct competitors for Baltic trade hegemony, a formidable military power in close proximity, and if they ally with other continental powers, Russia will surely lose sleep. The Grand Duchy of Finland has long been a weak point in Swedish rule. The Suomi tribes here attach themselves to strength; once Russia demonstrates its might, they will eagerly present maps and furs alike, kissing the Tsar's scepter. To expand our competitive advantage over Sweden, we must seize Finland."

EDG_RUS_mission_1_9_title:0 "Northern Hegemony"
EDG_RUS_mission_1_9_desc:0 "Our conquest of Finland has been highly successful. However, the ever-bellicose Lion of the North still postures upon its throne, its eyes brimming with resentment and defiance. We must continue our advance into Fennoscandia and put an end to the Swedish threat. A fair and open duel with it will be Russia's final act of mercy towards Sweden."

In the north, people speak of furs and shipbuilding materials; the southern lands appear suitable for growing many crops. Many European powers have been expanding into this bountiful land, and it is not too late for us to assert our dominance there: let us establish bases and plant the Russian eagle flag on territories under the sun!"

EDG_RUS_mission_1_24_title:0 "Canadian Frontier"
EDG_RUS_mission_1_24_desc:0 "The northern lands of the New World are bitterly cold, making it difficult for colonists from other parts of Europe to gain a foothold. But the children of Rus' are long accustomed to far northern climates; our explorers have already established settlements in the New World, and the Motherland's fur trade has grown more prosperous thanks to Alyaska and Canada. Currently, more lands in the New World await exploration and settlement. These lands and their wealth shall all belong to Mother Russia!"

EDG_RUS_mission_2_2_desc:0 "In the past, Rurik was invited by the people of Novgorod to come to Rus'. Before he came, Rus' was a deep, stagnant pool; after he came, Rus' became an eternal flame. History proves that only Rurik's descendants can lead Rus' to greatness and prosperity; republicanism breeds only destruction. Now, the mob in Smolensk suffers from delusions of grandeur, usurping the power of the Rurikid princes. We must suppress this sprout of betrayal, making all Rus' people realize once more that the Rurikids are the sole masters over Rus'!"

The people here have long been harassed by Lithuanians and Poles, their situation precarious. Meanwhile, the influence of Western powers has gradually planted unworthy ideas in the minds of the White Ruthenian principalities. On the bloody road to unifying all Rus', to prevent its fragmentation once more, we have no choice but to raise our blades, commit necessary evils, brutally suppress the budding secession in White Rus', and bring them back to the embrace of Mother Russia!"

EDG_RUS_mission_2_6_title:0 "Invade Poland"
EDG_RUS_mission_2_6_desc:0 "Once powerful, the Kingdom of Poland was fractured and weakened after the turmoil of Varna. Germans, Magyars, and Bohemians all conspire to carve up the White Eagle's legacy. Our Tsar is not only the ruler of Rus' but also the leader of all Slavs. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cannot bear to see the children of Lech fall into ruin. Let us take up Bolesław's crown and end Poland's strife."

EDG_RUS_mission_2_9_title:0 "The German Frontier"
EDG_RUS_mission_2_9_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire; it is merely a tool for Germans to pursue their own interests. Germans have inflicted countless calamities upon the Slavic peoples in the past, causing the downfall of numerous Polabian ancestors. Russia is the greatest Slavic nation, destined to shoulder the divine duty of defending our Slavic brethren—let us shatter the German border walls; the lowly Teutons deserve only to be trampled under Rus' feet!"

EDG_RUS_mission_2_11_title:0 "Devour Anatolia"

EDG_RUS_mission_2_14_desc:0 "The ports on the White Sea are usable only three months a year. While Baltic ports have longer navigation periods, they face severe competition from our enemies. Undoubtedly, the nation needs an ice-free port to participate in maritime trade. Crimea, on the shores of the Black Sea, sits astride Russia's vital trade route to the south. It is both a strategically defensible frontline and a well-situated harbor. For the sake of the Russian Motherland, we must control it."

EDG_RUS_mission_2_18_desc:0 "Since the days of Kievan Rus', the Tysyatsky (Thousandman) has served as a military leader; now they hold judicial and commercial positions. Militarily, they have largely been abolished, replaced by commanders; administratively, they have been supplanted by governors. However, Tysyatsky remain active in some of our provinces.

EDG_RUS_mission_5_12_desc:0 "\nThe fields there are immensely vast,\nThe path of the Muses stretches far!\nHow shall we repay\nYour benevolence and magnanimity?\nWe sing praises of Your Majesty's talents,\nIn the lands where the sun rises,\nLeaving Your Majesty's generous mark,\nThe green grass and trees on both banks of the Amur,\nCan mighty fortresses and oceans serve as barriers?\nDesolate steppes are no obstacle,\nArrows falling like rain are in vain,\nThey will surely become your shame.\nYou are the master of the blizzard,\nBreaking through thousands of li of ice and snow caves,\nOpening up the Eastern road,\nThe White Sea in the East has deep waters and surging waves,\nClasping hands in oath to express loyalty,\nRus' will surely win the war.\nWe, your humble lovers of God,\nWill proclaim on Parnassus,\nYou flee while we emerge victorious."

EDG_RUS_mission_5_14_desc:0 "Vodka, the traditional Rus' liquor, is a cheap product that can be mass-produced. Expanding production of this strong spirit will not only generate significant revenue but also have unexpected utility in other areas."

EDG_RUS_mission_5_15_desc:0 "Previously, Russia has already reaped substantial benefits from vodka production. Now it is time to intensify efforts by establishing a state monopoly on alcohol supply, ensuring ample provision of cheap vodka. This will not only create new revenue streams but also control product quality and help manage our populace more effectively."

EDG_RUS_mission_5_22_desc:0 "Serfdom effectively increases national overall productivity—and ensures control over the populace, keeping the fate of the peasants in our hands. While the old system had its uses, it has now become a hindrance to our nation's entry into the industrial age. The peasants should be liberated from the hands of nobles and merchants."

EDG_RUS_mission_5_23_desc:0 "After driving the Tatars out of the Ural region, our explorers have mapped the vast, unused Siberian lands into Rus'' territory. However, our control over these areas remains weak. We must establish colonial outposts one by one, develop markets, and organize military districts, so they can be fully brought under Russian control, becoming the backbone of the Rus' endless empire."

EDG_RUS_mission_5_24_desc:0 "Our eastward expansion has achieved a glorious victory with the incorporation of the Manchurian coast. We should establish a city there—Vladivostok—not only as the center for our commercial and naval activities in the Pacific and East Asia, but also as a symbol of the grand achievements of the expeditionary forces under the Tsar's protection."
