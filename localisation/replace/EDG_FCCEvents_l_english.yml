EDG_FCCEvents.0.name:0 "The Burgundian League and the County of Franche-Comté"
EDG_FCCEvents.0.desc:0 "The Burgundian League is merely a collective term for five small counties in the Burgundy region. Due to the high degree of autonomy this region enjoys under the French king, it did not participate extensively in the previous Commonweal Alliance. Even when there was some dissatisfaction, it was quickly appeased. Among these, Franche-Comté is the largest county in the League and also serves as the eastern gateway to the territories ruled in the French king's name.\n\nIn terms of feudal structure, Franche-Comté owes allegiance to the French king; in legal terms, it also belongs to the Empire. This dual status grants [Root.Monarch.GetName] opportunities distinct from those of imperial princes and the French king's various fiefs. With powerful and astute political acumen and intuition, one could extract substantial benefits from the conflicts between the Empire and the French king.\n\nHowever, risk and opportunity coexist. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ability to manage the county's unique position will be the guiding light determining the unpredictable future of the county."

EDG_FCCEvents.1.name:0 "The Shadow"
EDG_FCCEvents.1.desc:0 "As a vassal, if one seeks to secure more benefits, the relationship with [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] is crucial.\n\nLeaning too heavily toward either side prevents maximizing gains; only by maintaining a delicate balance can one acquire more leverage. This has been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s experience in ruling this small county. But this time, there is a more important matter to discuss with [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName].\n\nInitially, members of the Burgundian League showed some interest in the Commonweal Alliance. However, knowing that breaking away from the French king would make them easy prey for the Carolingian dynasty above and the Empire, they maintained a delicate balance with the French king. Yet, interests always attract everyone. When unable to oppose the French king alone, they began to band together, with the nominal leadership falling upon the County of Franche-Comté, due to its unique political position enabling it to gain capital from the Empire to resist the French king.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s audience with [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] is precisely for this purpose. However, regarding the interests of the Burgundian League, [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems to have their own considerations. Their private conversation lasted longer than any previous discussion about the Burgundian League. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped out of the palace, the guards seemed to detect a faint, peculiar smile on the face of the duke of that small county—but it vanished almost instantly."

EDG_FCCEvents.2.name:0 "Dawn?"
EDG_FCCEvents.2.desc:0 "After [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s discussion with the King of France, the King's attitude toward the Burgundian League shifted abruptly from vague to extremely firm. Not only did he refuse the concessions proposed by the League, but he also revoked several privileges the League had previously enjoyed. This enraged the League members, who began seeking alliances with various powers to prepare for armed resistance against the King in pursuit of greater rights.\n\nThe focus of this meeting was how to assemble an army capable of rivaling the King's forces. Despite the heavy downpour, the League's meeting proceeded without delay. With the promised imperial support from Duke [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Franche-Comté and the economic backing of the Commonweal Alliance, the Burgundian League's strength had grown considerably. This gathering in Dijon aimed to discuss how to transform the pledged support into a force against the King.\n\nThe meeting progressed with great difficulty. Everyone sought more resources to strengthen their own positions while avoiding losses, leading to slow progress. [Root.Monarch.GetName] continuously mediated the conflicts among the parties, occasionally glancing through the window toward the castle's inner gate.\n\nA loud crash from the doorway interrupted the proceedings. Over a dozen heavily armed soldiers stormed into the room. The Duke of Dijon, closest to the door, attempted to draw his sword but was swiftly subdued. Everything happened too quickly. Before anyone could fully comprehend the situation, the soldiers advanced toward them, and their leader announced that, by the King's orders, they were there to arrest all rebellious dukes. Clearly, no one had anticipated the King's troops appearing so openly in their own territories to apprehend them. Reactions ranged from fear to resentment, but only [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked toward the door, unable to suppress a growing smile.\n\nAmidst the stunned expressions of the others, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached the doorway, turned to face the dukes, and finally allowed his smile to spread freely:"

EDG_FCCEvents.3.name:0 "The Bargain"
EDG_FCCEvents.3.desc:0 "After that day concluded, with [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s assistance, the King of France successfully subdued all forces of the Burgundian League. In accordance with their agreement, the Burgundy region was handed over to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for administration, and the feudal contract was altered to that of a direct fief. This move not only eradicated several potential rebel factions entrenched in the Burgundy region but also gained a powerful ally—at least for now.\n\nThe events unfolded somewhat too smoothly. Even months later, [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] continued to monitor the actions of the last remaining member of the Burgundian League. If he could betray the League, he could just as easily betray the King. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] formally took control of the Burgundy region, his first action was not to focus on castles or estates but to turn his attention to the wine estates near Dijon, acquiring them all through various means. This puzzling behavior made [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] [FRA.Monarch.GetName] suspicious—was this merely a smokescreen?\n\nHalf-convinced and half-doubting, [FRA.Monarch.GetName] decided to meet this cunning Count of Franche-Comté.\n\n'...So, what is it you truly wish to do now, or what do you plan to do?' [FRA.Monarch.GetName] cautiously inquired.\n\n'Go to the winery and get some wine.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] replied without hesitation.\n\n'Let me be more direct. You betrayed the Burgundian League and all those who supported you. What did you gain these lands and power for, in the end?'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] lowered his head in contemplation. The palace fell into an eerie silence, the air seemingly frozen. Finally, he spoke slowly:\n\n'To get better wine from better wineries.'"

EDG_FCCEvents.4.name:0 "Night Rain"
EDG_FCCEvents.4.desc:0 "The chill of late autumn had seeped through the thick stone walls of the Château de Dijon. Outside the window, the sky was a leaden gray, a continuous cold rain tapping against the stained glass, leaving winding trails of water that blurred the view of the damp courtyard and bare chestnut branches.\n\nIn the fireplace, flames danced restlessly, crackling as they licked at the massive oak logs. The air carried the scent of aged parchment, sealing wax, and a faint, almost imperceptible hint of damp mold. Scattered across the desk were reports from border fortresses, festival announcements from Bordeaux and other regions, and copies of carefully worded letters from the Holy Roman Emperor. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wearily reviewed these trivial matters, pondering which wine to taste.\n\nBut the silence was abruptly broken by hurried, deliberately muted footsteps—it was his personal guard captain, a burly man with a scarred face. He nearly jogged into the room, dropped to one knee, and held up a letter case draped with thick waterproof oilcloth, his breath still ragged. 'Your Majesty! A courier from Paris! Just entered the city gates!' His voice was hoarse from the long journey, laced with a barely perceptible tension.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] spun around sharply, his robe swirling behind him. The firelight from the hearth instantly illuminated his tense face. He strode to the desk without a word, simply extending his hand. The guard captain immediately presented the case. It was crafted from fine ebony, edged with brass, and heavy. Most striking was the large, not-yet-fully-dried deep red sealing wax at the seal—clearly imprinted with the fleur-de-lis of the French royal house.\n\nThe air in the study seemed to freeze. The sound of rain and the crackle of flames became unnervingly distinct. [Root.Monarch.GetName] picked up a small, delicate silver letter opener, its tip gleaming coldly in the firelight. He took a deep breath, his movements steady yet carrying an undeniable finality, and pried open the seal that symbolized royal authority."

Yet, the Duchy of Burgundy and its provinces, like the most steadfast pillars of the realm, shine brightly under Your Grace's wise governance. Such virtue and capability shall forever reside in our heart. For the common good of the kingdom and your duchy, we earnestly desire to meet with you.\n\nIt is hereby ordained that around the Feast of Saint Denis, in our Louvre Palace in Paris, and in the presence of the assembled nobles of the realm, we shall await Your Grace's personal attendance. To manifest our exceptional favor, we shall present to you certain unprecedented liberties and exemptions drawn up by our Privy Council. These will include reductions in tribute, adjustments to borders, confirmation of judicial rights, and even expansions of your military privileges. For all these, we are willing to pledge our royal seal and swear upon the relics of Saint Louis to grant them to you, so that the Duchy of Burgundy may forever bask under royal grace, enjoying supreme glory for all ages.\n\nTo dispel any doubts Your Grace may have about the journey, we, by the royal insignia attached to this letter, grant you a royal safe-conduct, permitting you to come to our presence with one hundred halberd-bearing knights. Our blood relative, Louis, Duke of Orléans, shall meet Your Grace at the city of Dijon bearing royal gifts, and all our castles along the route shall surrender their keys to you.\n\nTherefore, by the Most Sacred Heart of God and the bond of the oath of fealty you have sworn to us, we earnestly beseech you: trust in the sincerity of this letter and joyfully attend the meeting at the appointed time. By acting thus, you shall more abundantly win our favor, eradicate the roots of discord, and plant peace for eternity.\n\nWritten at our court in Paris, in the year of our Lord [GetYear]."

They considered it entirely unnecessary to have a department directly responsible to [Root.Monarch.GetName] reporting on the economic revenue and related affairs of the wine industry.\n\nAfter consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [Root.Monarch.GetName] concluded that the two should be merged into a new institution responsible for managing the royal economy while operating key grape-related industries.

EDG_FCCExpandEvents.2.desc:0 "The new institution has proven to be highly effective. It was ultimately named the Ministry of Economic Coordination, with the requirement that its officeholders must be nobles with involvement in the wine industry. This requirement, along with the ministry itself, has profoundly influenced changes within the domestic class structure.\n\nSince some positions in the Ministry of Economic Coordination involve managing wine industry operations, nobles began studying estate management and started participating in commercial activities on a large scale. They sought to achieve better performance while simultaneously advancing their own families' wine industry ventures. Consequently, much of the nobility gradually evolved into a hybrid class, half-noble and half-merchant.\n\nMeanwhile, the influence of the merchant class, represented by guilds and chambers of commerce, has been steadily declining. On one hand, nobles began forming organizations similar to merchant associations; on the other, some merchants directly chose to purchase titles to become nobles, also joining this hybrid class of half-noble, half-merchant. Thus, although a purely merchant class still holds some influence in certain cities, it can no longer sway national policy decisions."
