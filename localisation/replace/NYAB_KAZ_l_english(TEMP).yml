NYAB_BJR_1: "Islamization of Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_1_desc: "The Bolghars are like a small boat floating in a vast ocean - the slightest imbalance will capsize us. What creates this precarious situation? The countless infidels surrounding us. While Eastern Europe remains outside Allah's protection, how can we ever be secure? As Allah's chosen people, we must bring the Rus' to the true faith. Allahu Akbar!"
NYAB_BJR_2: "Mahdist Spirit"
NYAB_BJR_2_desc: "The Mahdist Spirit (or Messianic Zeal) emerged from our position between the nominally Muslim Rus' and outright pagans. This sense of being Allah's chosen people and inheritors of the Prophet's mission to spread the true faith worldwide has become our salvation.\nThis salvational fervor, combined with the resilience of Muslims in these northern lands, makes us fight bravely against all hardships."
NYAB_BJR_3: "Bolgharo-Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_3_desc: "With our sparse Bolghar population, we inevitably must employ Rus' officials to govern Rus' territories. We've integrated Sharia into the Rus' administrative system while preserving our conquering traditions. Appointing Rus' administrators will prove crucial in our journey to conquer and assimilate the Rus' people."
NYAB_BJR_4: "Saqaliba Vanguard"
NYAB_BJR_4_desc: "We've long relied on the cavalry skills from our nomadic past. But our enemies share these skills - they're more experienced and can counter our tactics. We resolve to innovate by deploying the Saqaliba as a fearless vanguard to break enemy lines with their death-defying courage."
NYAB_BJR_5: "Unification of Rus' Princes"
NYAB_BJR_5_desc: "The Rurikid and Bolghar princes have long submitted to us in exchange for local autonomy. But for our nation's rise, their pleas for mercy will fall on deaf ears - we must systematically remove them all."
NYAB_BJR_6: "Complete Centralization"
NYAB_BJR_6_desc: "Since ancient Bolghar times, we've suffered from feudal decentralization. Under Mongol rule, we began centralizing reforms. Only through complete centralization can we properly defend our realm."
NYAB_BJR_7: "Jihad From Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_7_desc: "With domestic consolidation complete, we can finally turn westward to fulfill our long-delayed duty against the infidels, ending centuries of passive defense and striking back against those who oppressed us."

NYAB_BOG_1: "Islamization of Rus'"
NYAB_BOG_1_desc: "The Bolghars are like a lone leaf boat adrift in a vast ocean - the slightest disturbance could capsize us. What created this isolation? The countless infidels surrounding us. While Eastern Europe remains beyond Allah's protection, how can we ever be secure? As Allah's chosen people, we must bring the Rus' to the true faith. Allahu Akbar!"
NYAB_BOG_2: "Mahdist Zeal"
NYAB_BOG_2_desc: "The Mahdist Spirit (or Messianic Fervor) emerged from our position between the nominally Muslim Rus' and outright pagans. This sense of divine election as inheritors of the Prophet's mission to spread the true faith has become our salvation.\nThis redemptive zeal, combined with the resilience of northern Muslims, makes us fight fearlessly against all adversity."
NYAB_BOG_3: "Bolgharo-Rus' Administration"
NYAB_BOG_3_desc: "With our sparse Bolghar population, we must employ Rus' officials to govern Rus' lands. We've integrated Sharia into the Rus' administrative framework while preserving our martial traditions. Appointing Rus' administrators proves crucial in our campaign to conquer and assimilate the Rus' people."
NYAB_BOG_4: "Yahya's Reforms"
NYAB_BOG_4_desc: "Historically, both old Bolgharia and the Rus' principalities relied on cavalry forces. Yet against Tatars, Poles, and Germans, our horsemen proved inferior - our knights would rout immediately when facing German or Polish heavy cavalry.\nThus Emperor Yahya instituted reforms - prioritizing infantry over cavalry."
NYAB_BOG_5: "King of Saqaliba"
NYAB_BOG_5_desc: "All Saqaliba must submit to the Bolghar Sultan, whether willingly or not, and serve in his armies. Countless Islamic scholars and travelers come to our lands, reverently addressing our Sultan as the 'King of Saqaliba'."
NYAB_BOG_6: "Bolghar Divan"
NYAB_BOG_6_desc: "The numerous Saqaliba population requires careful management. We established the Divan (council), allowing Saqaliba to elect regional representatives who then participate in governance at Zilyarov. Each major district's Saqaliba delegates are supervised by a Bolghar overseer to prevent collusion. However, the Saqaliba's mutual animosities likely prevent any grand conspiracies."
NYAB_BOG_7: "Global Jihad"
NYAB_BOG_7_desc: "The Islamic world has long been in decline - since the failed Rashidun invasion of Persia and the Franks' crushing of the Umayyads, our faith has visibly weakened. As Allah's chosen people and the Prophet's heirs, how can we stand idle while infidels rejoice? Warriors of Allah, join me in launching a Jihad for the entire world!"

While integrating Sharia into the Rus' administrative system, we maintain our conquering traditions. Appointing Rus' administrators proves crucial in our campaign to conquer and assimilate the Rus' people - though many reject our rule due to our barbaric methods."
NYAB_BOG_42:"Modernized Bolghar Cavalry Formations"
NYAB_BOG_42_desc:"Taking inspiration from the Rus' 'Streltsy', we've equipped our cavalry with modern firearms. In battle, the Saqaliba serve as vanguards to absorb initial enemy volleys, followed by disciplined Bolghar mounted arquebusiers charging to break enemy formations. With sufficient speed, our cavalry can shatter enemy morale before they reload."
NYAB_BOG_52: "King of Saqaliba"
NYAB_BOG_52_desc: "All Saqaliba must submit to the Bolghar Khan, willingly or not, and serve in his armies.

Consequently, numerous Islamic warriors now journey to Bolghar lands to serve the Khan."
NYAB_BOG_62:"Recruitment of Tribal Warriors"

NYAB_BOG_44_desc:"One's birth matters little now - if you have value to the Sultan, you may rise high. As the saying goes 'Do not confine talents to conventional standards', we've attracted numerous capable - or 'useful' - individuals into our military. Most are exiled foreign specialists, greatly benefiting our tactics."
NYAB_BOG_54:"'Land of Autocracy'"
NYAB_BOG_54_desc:"A term foreign scholars use mockingly for glorious Bolghar. They depict our realm as a hellish dystopia ruled by a terrifying tyrant, claiming our people live in misery. Perhaps? Let them come see for themselves what kind of nation Bolghar truly is..."
NYAB_BOG_64:"Dance of Power"
NYAB_BOG_64_desc:"The Bolghar monarch grips the blade of authority, observing the 'puppets' in his court moving at his whim. Behind those penetrating eyes lie countless desires. On power's stage, he dances alone in the end, while mere mortals can only follow his lead."

NYAB_BOG_rev_4:"Soul of Revolution"
NYAB_BOG_rev_4_desc:"Never forget the blood we shed, never forget the sorrows of the old era, never forget the soul of revolution. For the revolution is invincible. Even when mortally wounded, it will struggle to tear flesh from our enemies. Blood and life exist solely for the revolution."
NYAB_BOG_rev_5:"Unyielding Resolve"
NYAB_BOG_rev_5_desc:"The Revolutionary Guard defends our ideals, their noble souls indomitable against all worldly forces. We shall never retreat before the storms of fate. No matter how many times we're struck down, we'll rise again to charge forward."
NYAB_BOG_rev_6:"Revolutionary Committee"
NYAB_BOG_rev_6_desc:"After abolishing Bolghar's old administrative system, a new Committee has emerged. Its purpose is to safeguard revolutionary gains and establish a stable government serving the Bolghar people. In reality, its grip on Bolghar-Rus' territories exceeds even the previous regime's control."
NYAB_BOG_rev_7:"Raise High the Walls"
NYAB_BOG_rev_7_desc:"When we raise high our walls and build towers piercing the clouds, not even mighty Bolghar herself could overthrow us. Our broken nation and withered faith teach us that only by erecting walls to separate from the wild grasses can we preserve authority and stability forever."

NYAB_GOL_1: "Legitimate Jochid Ulus"
NYAB_GOL_1_desc: "Our Great Khan is also a member of the Borjigin clan's Jochid line. It is his duty to depose the incompetent Golden Horde Khan and proclaim himself as the new Khan of the Jochid Ulus. This is his responsibility both to his Mongol brethren and to Allah."
NYAB_GOL_2: "Mongol Administrative System"
NYAB_GOL_2_desc: "Over centuries, our ancestors refined the Mongol administrative system, unashamed to incorporate ideas and methods from conquered cultures. Our system is partly based on traditions dating back to Genghis Khan himself, and partly on the practices of Allah's servants - Muslim officials. If our reborn state is to prosper and expand, we must build a pragmatic imperial administration."
NYAB_GOL_3: "Mongol Traditions"
NYAB_GOL_3_desc: "While our empire may no longer be ruled from horseback, our army certainly is. For centuries we've maintained traditions that ensure few can match our riders. As we adopt new technologies and tactics, we must preserve the strong, organized martial traditions of the Mongol Empire."
NYAB_GOL_4: "Central Asian Trade Hub"
NYAB_GOL_4_desc: "Not all wealth comes from the lands we rule directly. Trade is the source of all riches, and the Jochid Ulus has always protected merchant caravans. By ensuring safe passage for all who transport goods through our realm, we maintain steady flows of furs, Chinese crafts, silks, spices, and other commodities our cities demand. Whether they choose to sell to us or not, their presence enriches our people."
NYAB_GOL_5: "Call to the Steppe Peoples"
NYAB_GOL_5_desc: "All peoples of the Great Steppe still remember the glory of our Mongol Empire. When the Great Khan raises his banner, they gather beneath his standard without hesitation, ready to march through fire for him."

NYAB_MGE_2: "Pax Mongolica"
NYAB_MGE_2_desc: "Over centuries, our ancestors refined the Mongol administrative system, unashamed to incorporate ideas from conquered cultures. Our system blends traditions dating back to Genghis Khan himself with Chinese bureaucratic methods. For our reborn state to prosper and expand, we must build a pragmatic imperial administration."
NYAB_MGE_3: "Chinese Bureaucracy"
NYAB_MGE_3_desc: "After conquering China, the Khan was deeply impressed by the Celestial Empire's administrative efficiency and immediately began adopting their systems. Chinese bureaucrats prove equally skilled in governance and military command, rivaling even Mongol commanders."
NYAB_MGE_4: "Global Commerce"
NYAB_MGE_4_desc: "Not all wealth comes from lands we directly rule. Trade generates prosperity, and the Mongol Empire has always protected merchant caravans. By safeguarding all who transport goods through our realm, we ensure steady flows of furs, Chinese manufactures, silks, spices, and other commodities our cities require. Their very presence enriches our people, whether they trade with us or not."
NYAB_MGE_5: "Appointment of Darughachi"
NYAB_MGE_5_desc: "Historically, Darughachi held both civil and military authority as regional governors, positions reserved only for Mongols or Semu people. Now, Han Chinese may serve as Darughachi if they prove loyal to the Khan. These governors report directly to the Khan, obeying no other authority."
NYAB_MGE_6: "Expansion of the Kheshig"
NYAB_MGE_6_desc: "In former times, the Khan's Kheshig guard comprised only pure-blooded Mongols. Those days are gone - our vast Mongol realm now draws elite warriors from every corner of the empire to serve the Khan, ready to march through fire at his command."
NYAB_MGE_7: "Genghis Khan Reborn"

NYAB_BJR_aimier_reform_desc:"Zilyarov, the Tatar transliteration of Moscow, is adopted by the Bolghars to signify their position in Rus'. The Bolghars spread their advanced agricultural techniques throughout Rus' while establishing political systems suited for the new era, incorporating Islamic features like the Iqta system. Tribal elders still wield significant power in government, with the state resembling a feudal tribal confederation."

NYAB_BJR_aimier_reform2:"Zilyarov Emirate"
NYAB_BJR_aimier_reform2_desc:"Zilyarov, the Tatar transliteration of Moscow, signifies the Bolghar presence in Rus'. While spreading advanced agriculture and adapting governance to the times (including Islamic Iqta systems), tribal influence has waned significantly. The Saqaliba (or Boyars) now dominate government positions. Though nearly fully feudalized, tensions between tribes and Boyars intensify daily."

NYAB_BJR_sudan_reform:"Bolghar Sultanate"
NYAB_BJR_sudan_reform_desc:"Guided by Allah, these former steppe nomads settled the Eastern European plains. Adopting and adapting Rus' institutions, they established the Bolghar Sultanate in the Saqaliba's promised land, leaving nomadic backwardness behind.

In this time, we Bolghars have tasted bitter suffering - first becoming vassals of the Khaganate, forced to pay exorbitant tribute and send hostages to Atil. Even distant Rus and Ugric merchants had to export their furs to the Khazars.\n\nUntil the Bolghars sought aid from the Caliph, and Allah's messengers brought us faith and protection. Thus we avoided being carved up by the Khaganate. Later, when the Khazar Khanate was partitioned, the Bolghars briefly became masters of these steppes and a hub of trade. But our respite was short-lived - Cumans and Mongols came in waves. As Eastern Europe's only Islamic state, we Bolghars cowered near the fortress of Kazan, unable to sleep soundly.\n\nNow, our time has come. The Golden Horde crumbles while the Rus states remain divided. In Allah's name, we shall launch jihad against the infidels!"

He was originally a student of Hasan al-Basri (642-728), a hadith scholar and second-generation disciple of the Seal of the Prophets: Muhammad. The Mu'tazila's religious philosophy inherited the free will doctrine of early Islam's Qadariyya school, incorporating Greek rationalism while blending Neoplatonic emanation theory, Aristotelian logic, and Pythagorean soul theory with Islamic theology. They applied rational interpretation to the Quran and discussed issues of hadith and jurisprudence, forming a religious-philosophical system with rationalist tendencies. Thus, the Mu'tazila transformed Islam's simple faith into profound philosophy.\n\nUnfortunately, this philosophical school was suppressed by the Ash'arites and now stands nearly extinct.

Influenced by Quranic injunctions and hadiths such as 'The ink of scholars is more sacred than the blood of martyrs,' the Abbasids emphasized the value of knowledge, transforming the Muslim world into a center of science, philosophy, medicine, and education - with the Abbasids themselves becoming fountains of wisdom. They established the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where Muslim and non-Muslim scholars gathered to translate the world's knowledge into Arabic in what became known as the Translation Movement. Numerous classical works that would later be lost in their original languages were preserved in Arabic, then subsequently translated into Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, and Latin. The Muslim world during its Golden Age became a cultural melting pot that collected, synthesized, and elevated knowledge from ancient Mesopotamian, Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, North African, Greek, and Byzantine civilizations. The Fatimids of Egypt and Umayyads of al-Andalus became major centers of learning, with Cairo and Cordoba emerging as Baghdad's rivals.\n\nThen came the Mongol onslaught that mercilessly crushed Baghdad under hoof, humiliating the Abbasid Caliphate and abruptly cutting short Islam's Golden Age.

Yet ultimately, this represents our society's natural evolution - those once accustomed to wide-eyed herding on the steppes, living with unsettled hearts, seem to have tired of such existence. They find themselves drawn unwittingly to feudalization's tide, developing aspirations for power and territory. However, this change doesn't come overnight. Some tribal elders stubbornly cling to traditional ways - dwelling in tents, taking pleasure in shepherding, driving off those who cultivate land while seizing their fields for grazing pastures.\n\nTensions escalate between the tribes and newly elevated nobility, whether they be Emirs or Boyars.

If this is fate's decree, then we shall raise our banners against cruel destiny!\n\nWhen one lit the flame, thousands took up arms. The Saqaliba pressed against the cliff's edge, swallowing mist with the north wind's bitter draught. How much suffering? How much humiliation? Never again shall the Saqaliba endure oppression.

The unrelenting storm's curtain isolates the city from the world, concealing all wickedness and suffering in darkness. The raging Dnieper surges with waves, carrying countless innocent souls to the underworld.\n\nA man kneels in the rain, head bowed before imperial executioners. Rainwater pools around his feet, entangling his legs, trying to drag him into the abyss. Gunshots crack through the air, startling flocks of ravens.

Far from Bolghar political centers, the city has become fertile ground for heresies and radical ideas.\n\nThis is where Ivan was born and raised. After his parents were killed by Bolghars, young Ivan survived by hiding in a cellar - and swore eternal vengeance. But as a common Saqaliba, he was powerless. Yet Kiev teemed with secret organizations, and he found kindred spirits. In these shadows, a new ideology took root like a spark: The 'Saqaliba' are the last embers of the Rus' nation, the true masters of Rus' lands and destiny.\n\nThis rebellious thought became a beacon of hope for southern Rus' Saqaliba. Secretly, the 'New Rus'' organization grew, aided by Bolghar enemies who recognized its potential.\n\nBut Kiev now lies under Bolghar surveillance - their spies form an oppressive web that suffocates dissent.

According to the so-called 'Friend of the Rus' People', today the Governor of Chiryalov would travel this road to Istkam. As the Bolghar nerve center, Chiryalov connected north and south - assassinating its governor would greatly aid the coming uprising, potentially causing enough bureaucratic chaos to delay their suppression efforts. Rumor said this governor descended from local Rus' nobility, yet he collaborated with the Bolghars to oppress his own people.\n\nThe ornate carriage approached - inside sat his quarry.

His comrades had sacrificed themselves covering his escape. Now Ivan crashed through the forest blindly, emerging onto a remote road. As he hesitated about which way to flee, a voice commanded: 'Get in.' A carriage pulled up beside him.\n\nYahya studied the man - revolutionary armband, disheveled clothes, white-knuckled grip on his rifle. Without doubt, this was either an underground operative or at least a radical sympathizer.\n\nAfter confirming no pursuers, Ivan finally relaxed. 'Thanks, brother,' he began, then froze mid-handshake as he recognized the Bolghar official's uniform. Ivan raised his weapon sharply.

NYAB_KAZ_132_d: "As the Governor's mansion in Chiryalov melts in flames, one recalls the great fire that once devastated this city. The harbinger of doom came from the east, reducing it to ash and ruin. That Rus' city wailed in agony beneath Bolghar demons' inferno - a hellfire burning day and night, its black smoke blotting out the sun, weaving a shroud over all Rus'.\n\nUpon Rus' bones and the ashes of their cities rose Chiryalov - gleaming Bolghar towers and golden palaces built upon scorched earth and sin. Now new flames dance through these streets: the Rus' people's fire, their vengeance, climbing the Bolghars' spines. Crimson flames whirl between imperial arches, returning this ancient city to Rus' embrace."
NYAB_KAZ_132a: "Moscow - your true name is Moscow."

NYAB_KAZ_133_t: "The Indomitable City"
NYAB_KAZ_133_d: "Fatiha, as the Bolghars call her. This unassuming town embodies Rus' defiance. Centuries ago, she was first to face the Mongol hordes, first to suffer their massacre. Yet beneath their blades, she never yielded - becoming the backbone of Rus' resistance.\n\nWhen the Bolghars returned, this city again chose defiance, fighting the invaders relentlessly. No suffering could break her, no blade make her retreat. Like the Rus' people themselves - never submitting, never retreating, never compromising. Centuries of enslavement and assimilation haven't shaken the Rus' spirit. We will weather all storms to reach glory's shore."
NYAB_KAZ_133a: "Ryazan - soul of Rus' indomitability."

NYAB_KAZ_134_t: "Babylonian Captivity"
NYAB_KAZ_134_d: "Nidalsaray - the Bolghar Empire's heart, a capital built upon countless suffering, a city both sinful and absurd, tragic and sorrowful. All Rus' wealth plundered here, all Rus' artisans enslaved to build it. Its glittering architecture and bustling markets stand as scars upon the Rus' people.\n\nNow this gilded capital falls to those very 'Saqaliba' the Bolghars once despised. This wicked Babylon that imprisoned Rus' souls. By seizing the Bolghar seat of power, we'll dismantle their empire piece by piece. Nidalsaray - no, Nizhny Novgorod - shall become the Bolghar Empire's grave, where its collapse begins."
NYAB_KAZ_134a: "We are Rus' people, not stepping stones to your paradise!"

NYAB_KAZ_135_t: "Upon the Volga"
NYAB_KAZ_135_d: "Troops march along rutted dirt roads as barge haulers silently pull their ropes. The Volga flows as it always has - today's waters as heavy with history as yesterday's. Only now, no Bolghar oppressors remain in so-called 'Bolgharstan'. New Rus' banners fly over this city nestled in the Urals.\n\nBolgharstan - or rather Kazan again - this bastion of Bolghar power, this nest of iniquity, now lies in our hands. Once they invaded our homeland, occupied our cities, enslaved our people. Now the tide has turned. We'll shatter Bolghar rule completely and reclaim what was always ours."
NYAB_KAZ_135a: "From Kazan to the Urals, no Bolghar dominion remains."

NYAB_KAZ_136_t: "Judgment on the Ice"
NYAB_KAZ_136_d: "Novgorod - or 'Shar-Bolghar' as its collaborationist government calls it - is ruled by the so-called Merchant Veche, though in truth they're but profit-seeking traitors. They helped foreigners enslave their own people, sold Rus' interests to enemies, and delivered Novgorod to Tatar marauders.\n\nOutside Novgorod's walls, on wind-scoured tundra, these merchant-traitors march one by one to the gallows. They sold their nation to Bolghars and their souls to demons. Today brings their righteous judgment. Centuries ago, Rus' hero Nevsky saved our people from heathen blades on these frozen lakes - yet these vile merchants sold our nation to slavers. For fleeting survival they betrayed Novgorod to Bolghars. Now comes retribution."
NYAB_KAZ_136a: "Fit the nooses!"

NYAB_KAZ_137_t: "Shar-Bolghar's Final Night"
NYAB_KAZ_137_d: "Shar-Bolghar - the most prosperous commercial hub in all Bolghar-Rus. Here, loyalty and righteousness vanish like morning mist. For profit-driven merchants, only gold holds eternal value. Thus this city became Bolghar's most devoted subject, yet may transform into its fiercest opponent.\n\nAfter years of Bolghar-Saqaliba conflict, Shar-Bolghar's merchants calculate new odds. The empire struggles like a cornered beast - perhaps time to join Rus' gamble and claim this city's own victory. One grand wager, one decisive choice will determine its fate."

Novgorod's Baltic-focused merchants again seized their chance, declaring independence - surprising both warring factions. These unprincipled profiteers are universally despised, yet now both sides must carefully consider how to handle this nascent merchant state.\n\nWith all Eastern Europe embroiled in war, neither Rus' nor Bolghar can easily divert attention. Attacking Shar-Bolghar would overextend battle lines, while allowing its growth risks creating a powerful new enemy on the White Sea's edge."

NYAB_KAZ_139_d: "Istkam - once a Rus' heartland, our most populous region. This ancient city resisted Mongol horsemen, sheltered Rus' under Golden Horde rule, and survived Bolghar oppression. Despite cultural invasion, its people stubbornly used its true name: Tver.\n\nWhen we liberated the city, citizens welcomed us rapturously. Bolghars were driven out like rats, Tatar buildings burned, the Rus' city reborn. In Rus' name, our armies will purge remaining Bolghars from Rus' soil. We'll reclaim our ancestral lands and return home.\n\nPent-up rage turned against collaborating ulama. Mosque after mosque was dismantled. Minarets groaned, tilted earthward, then collapsed in dust clouds over the ruins. The crimson dawn rose as sunlight filtered through broken rubble onto Tver's sacred ground."

Novgorod's Veche Hall bears scars of oppression, Tver's fields gave their last grain, Moscow's gubernatorial ruins hold memories, Nizhny Novgorod's architecture shines with Rus' craftsmanship. The snow melts, winter retreats.\n\nAfter Bolghar tyranny's storm, gentle spring returns. Wildflowers bloom amid ruins. From these embers, Rus' torch rekindles."

The story concludes with Tsar Peter establishing a transcontinental Rus' superpower rivaling European empires.\n\nThis instant bestseller particularly resonates with young Rus', sparking movements proclaiming Rus' divine destiny to lead all Slavs toward unification.

They dream of carving their own destiny in those snowy wastes, free from interference.\n\nYet they don't comprehend Siberia's true nature. Beyond Bolghar-Rus lies a world of unknown perils. Endless winters bring deadly blizzards that freeze even hope itself. Brief summers swarm with insects and disease. Predators stalk dense taiga, while treacherous bogs and raging rivers bar passage.\n\nStill, the Saqaliba romanticize this harshness as freedom's crucible.

Yet our scholars' research reveals astonishing connections between Magyars and our own people. Ancient texts and artifacts suggest we may share bloodlines - long-lost brothers finally rediscovered.\n\nThis revelation redefines our relations. To honor this buried kinship, [Root.Monarch.GetName] issued a historic decree allowing Magyars to voluntarily embrace Islam and join the Bolghar family. This demonstrates both imperial magnanimity and profound respect for our brother nation.\n\nFor the Magyars, this means more than new identity - it offers the belonging they've long sought, a chance to write new chapters in Bolghar's tolerant realm."
