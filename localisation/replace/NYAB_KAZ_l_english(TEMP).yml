02BunringSteppe_bookmark:"§MABE§!-The Burning Steppe"
02BunringSteppe_bookmark_name_desc:"The sparks of turmoil and change lick at the steppe's roots, yearning for a conflagration. The great realm forged by @GOL§YJochi Khan§! and §YSain Khan§! teeters on the brink, while beneath the shadow of this behemoth, countless hidden daggers lie in wait.\nIn the south, @CRI§MCrimea§! has forsaken the Eternal Blue Sky, bowing instead to the fragile icons of cowards further south. The @KAZ§GBolghars§! cling steadfastly to their faith in Allah, never returning to Tengri even in submission. The @NOG§ONogai§! murzas look to add more infamy to their notorious names amidst this turmoil, and, the @GRHGrey Horde might well harbor the same ambitions.\nInternal conflicts intensify daily, while external contradictions grow equally uncontrollable. The long-suppressed @UKR§YRus§! people await the moment the steppe burns - they'll tear apart both glory and shame with their own hands."

NYAB_BJR_idea:"Zilyarov Ideas"
NYAB_BJR_idea_start:"Zilyarov Traditions"
NYAB_BJR_idea_bonus:"Zilyarov Ambition"
NYAB_BJR_1: "Islamization of Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_1_desc: "The Bolghars are like a small boat floating in a vast ocean - the slightest imbalance will capsize us. What creates this precarious situation? The countless infidels surrounding us. While Eastern Europe remains outside Allah's protection, how can we ever be secure? As Allah's chosen people, we must bring the Rus' to the true faith. Allahu Akbar!"
NYAB_BJR_2: "Mahdist Spirit"
NYAB_BJR_2_desc: "The Mahdist Spirit (or Messianic Zeal) emerged from our position between the nominally Muslim Rus' and outright pagans. This sense of being Allah's chosen people and inheritors of the Prophet's mission to spread the true faith worldwide has become our salvation.\nThis salvational fervor, combined with the resilience of Muslims in these northern lands, makes us fight bravely against all hardships."
NYAB_BJR_3: "Bolgharo-Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_3_desc: "With our sparse Bolghar population, we inevitably must employ Rus' officials to govern Rus' territories. We've integrated Sharia into the Rus' administrative system while preserving our conquering traditions. Appointing Rus' administrators will prove crucial in our journey to conquer and assimilate the Rus' people."
NYAB_BJR_4: "Saqaliba Vanguard"
NYAB_BJR_4_desc: "We've long relied on the cavalry skills from our nomadic past. But our enemies share these skills - they're more experienced and can counter our tactics. We resolve to innovate by deploying the Saqaliba as a fearless vanguard to break enemy lines with their death-defying courage."
NYAB_BJR_5: "Unification of Rus' Princes"
NYAB_BJR_5_desc: "The Rurikid and Bolghar princes have long submitted to us in exchange for local autonomy. But for our nation's rise, their pleas for mercy will fall on deaf ears - we must systematically remove them all."
NYAB_BJR_6: "Complete Centralization"
NYAB_BJR_6_desc: "Since ancient Bolghar times, we've suffered from feudal decentralization. Under Mongol rule, we began centralizing reforms. Only through complete centralization can we properly defend our realm."
NYAB_BJR_7: "Jihad From Rus'"
NYAB_BJR_7_desc: "With domestic consolidation complete, we can finally turn westward to fulfill our long-delayed duty against the infidels, ending centuries of passive defense and striking back against those who oppressed us."

NYAB_BOG_idea:"Bolghar Sultanate Ideas"
NYAB_BOG_idea_start:"Bolghar Sultanate Traditions"
NYAB_BOG_idea_bonus:"Bolghar SultanateAmbitions"
NYAB_BOG_1: "Islamization of Rus'"
NYAB_BOG_1_desc: "The Bolghars are like a lone leaf boat adrift in a vast ocean - the slightest disturbance could capsize us. What created this isolation? The countless infidels surrounding us. While Eastern Europe remains beyond Allah's protection, how can we ever be secure? As Allah's chosen people, we must bring the Rus' to the true faith. Allahu Akbar!"
NYAB_BOG_2: "Mahdist Zeal"
NYAB_BOG_2_desc: "The Mahdist Spirit (or Messianic Fervor) emerged from our position between the nominally Muslim Rus' and outright pagans. This sense of divine election as inheritors of the Prophet's mission to spread the true faith has become our salvation.\nThis redemptive zeal, combined with the resilience of northern Muslims, makes us fight fearlessly against all adversity."
NYAB_BOG_3: "Bolgharo-Rus' Administration"
NYAB_BOG_3_desc: "With our sparse Bolghar population, we must employ Rus' officials to govern Rus' lands. We've integrated Sharia into the Rus' administrative framework while preserving our martial traditions. Appointing Rus' administrators proves crucial in our campaign to conquer and assimilate the Rus' people."
NYAB_BOG_4: "Yahya's Reforms"
NYAB_BOG_4_desc: "Historically, both old Bolgharia and the Rus' principalities relied on cavalry forces. Yet against Tatars, Poles, and Germans, our horsemen proved inferior - our knights would rout immediately when facing German or Polish heavy cavalry.\nThus Emperor Yahya instituted reforms - prioritizing infantry over cavalry."
NYAB_BOG_5: "King of Saqaliba"
NYAB_BOG_5_desc: "All Saqaliba must submit to the Bolghar Sultan, whether willingly or not, and serve in his armies. Countless Islamic scholars and travelers come to our lands, reverently addressing our Sultan as the 'King of Saqaliba'."
NYAB_BOG_6: "Bolghar Divan"
NYAB_BOG_6_desc: "The numerous Saqaliba population requires careful management. We established the Divan (council), allowing Saqaliba to elect regional representatives who then participate in governance at Zilyarov. Each major district's Saqaliba delegates are supervised by a Bolghar overseer to prevent collusion. However, the Saqaliba's mutual animosities likely prevent any grand conspiracies."
NYAB_BOG_7: "Global Jihad"
NYAB_BOG_7_desc: "The Islamic world has long been in decline - since the failed Rashidun invasion of Persia and the Franks' crushing of the Umayyads, our faith has visibly weakened. As Allah's chosen people and the Prophet's heirs, how can we stand idle while infidels rejoice? Warriors of Allah, join me in launching a Jihad for the entire world!"


NYAB_GOL_idea:"Jochid Ulus Ideas"
NYAB_GOL_idea_start:"Jochid Ulus Traditions"
NYAB_GOL_idea_bonus:"Jochid Ulus Ambitions"
NYAB_GOL_1: "Legitimate Jochid Ulus"
NYAB_GOL_1_desc: "Our Great Khan is also a member of the Borjigin clan's Jochid line. It is his duty to depose the incompetent Golden Horde Khan and proclaim himself as the new Khan of the Jochid Ulus. This is his responsibility both to his Mongol brethren and to Allah."
NYAB_GOL_2: "Mongol Administrative System"
NYAB_GOL_2_desc: "Over centuries, our ancestors refined the Mongol administrative system, unashamed to incorporate ideas and methods from conquered cultures. Our system is partly based on traditions dating back to Genghis Khan himself, and partly on the practices of Allah's servants - Muslim officials. If our reborn state is to prosper and expand, we must build a pragmatic imperial administration."
NYAB_GOL_3: "Mongol Traditions"
NYAB_GOL_3_desc: "While our empire may no longer be ruled from horseback, our army certainly is. For centuries we've maintained traditions that ensure few can match our riders. As we adopt new technologies and tactics, we must preserve the strong, organized martial traditions of the Mongol Empire."
NYAB_GOL_4: "Central Asian Trade Hub"
NYAB_GOL_4_desc: "Not all wealth comes from the lands we rule directly. Trade is the source of all riches, and the Jochid Ulus has always protected merchant caravans. By ensuring safe passage for all who transport goods through our realm, we maintain steady flows of furs, Chinese crafts, silks, spices, and other commodities our cities demand. Whether they choose to sell to us or not, their presence enriches our people."
NYAB_GOL_5: "Call to the Steppe Peoples"
NYAB_GOL_5_desc: "All peoples of the Great Steppe still remember the glory of our Mongol Empire. When the Great Khan raises his banner, they gather beneath his standard without hesitation, ready to march through fire for him."
NYAB_GOL_6: "Khanate Logistics"
NYAB_GOL_6_desc: "Men remember the Great Khan's military might, but forget his exceptional logistics. We must emulate his methods if we are to conquer vast territories."
NYAB_GOL_7: "Descendants of Genghis Khan"
NYAB_GOL_7_desc: "As rightful descendants of Genghis Khan, our Khans are destined to conquer the world."

NYAB_MGE_idea:"Mongol Empire Ideas"
NYAB_MGE_idea_start:"Mongol Empire Traditions"
NYAB_MGE_idea_bonus:"Mongol Empire Ambitions"
NYAB_MGE_1: "Rebirth of the Mongol Empire"
NYAB_MGE_1_desc: "The Mongol Empire once conquered half the known world. Now, under our Great Khan's leadership, the Empire is reborn. We shall make the world tremble once more!"
NYAB_MGE_2: "Pax Mongolica"
NYAB_MGE_2_desc: "Over centuries, our ancestors refined the Mongol administrative system, unashamed to incorporate ideas from conquered cultures. Our system blends traditions dating back to Genghis Khan himself with Chinese bureaucratic methods. For our reborn state to prosper and expand, we must build a pragmatic imperial administration."
NYAB_MGE_3: "Chinese Bureaucracy"
NYAB_MGE_3_desc: "After conquering China, the Khan was deeply impressed by the Celestial Empire's administrative efficiency and immediately began adopting their systems. Chinese bureaucrats prove equally skilled in governance and military command, rivaling even Mongol commanders."
NYAB_MGE_4: "Global Commerce"
NYAB_MGE_4_desc: "Not all wealth comes from lands we directly rule. Trade generates prosperity, and the Mongol Empire has always protected merchant caravans. By safeguarding all who transport goods through our realm, we ensure steady flows of furs, Chinese manufactures, silks, spices, and other commodities our cities require. Their very presence enriches our people, whether they trade with us or not."
NYAB_MGE_5: "Appointment of Darughachi"
NYAB_MGE_5_desc: "Historically, Darughachi held both civil and military authority as regional governors, positions reserved only for Mongols or Semu people. Now, Han Chinese may serve as Darughachi if they prove loyal to the Khan. These governors report directly to the Khan, obeying no other authority."
NYAB_MGE_6: "Expansion of the Kheshig"
NYAB_MGE_6_desc: "In former times, the Khan's Kheshig guard comprised only pure-blooded Mongols. Those days are gone - our vast Mongol realm now draws elite warriors from every corner of the empire to serve the Khan, ready to march through fire at his command."
NYAB_MGE_7: "Genghis Khan Reborn"
NYAB_MGE_7_desc: "As rightful descendants of Genghis Khan, our Khans are destined to conquer all under heaven."

NYAB_BJR_aimier_reform:"Zilyarov Emirate"
NYAB_BJR_aimier_reform_desc:"Zilyarov, the Tatar transliteration of Moscow, is adopted by the Bolghars to signify their position in Rus'. The Bolghars spread their advanced agricultural techniques throughout Rus' while establishing political systems suited for the new era, incorporating Islamic features like the Iqta system. Tribal elders still wield significant power in government, with the state resembling a feudal tribal confederation."



NYAB_BJR_sakariba_reform:"Saqaliba Conscription"
NYAB_BJR_sakariba_reform_desc:"All Saqaliba must serve, regardless of faith. Only high-ranking nobles may avoid conscription by paying substantial exemption fees."



NYAB_BJR_ruskingdom_reform:"Appointment of Boyars"
NYAB_BJR_ruskingdom_reform_desc:"Boyars, the Slavic nobility of Eastern Europe, prove essential for governing our vast territories. We grant them privileges to administer regions, even permitting their native faiths - provided they pay additional taxes and safeguard our sovereign interests."

NYAB_BJR_care_nomadic_reform:"Pacify the Tribes"
NYAB_BJR_care_nomadic_reform_desc:"Our tribes have fought alongside us through life and death for years to build this nation. How could we wrong them now? Let us expel these Rus' barbarians from their lands and return the territories to our dear tribal chiefs, allowing them to continue shining brightly!"

NYAB_BJR_firearmy_reform:"Adopt the Streltsy"
NYAB_BJR_firearmy_reform_desc:"The Saqaliba have developed a novel organization called the Streltsy. When armed with modern firearms by the government, though expensive to maintain, they often prove decisive on the battlefield."

NYAB_BJR_buzuarmy_reform:"Reform Tribal Cavalry Tactics"
NYAB_BJR_buzuarmy_reform_desc:"Times change - our once-unstoppable cavalry has lost its advantage against enemy counter-tactics. We must adapt by studying Mongol tactics, combining them with fearless Saqaliba vanguards to break enemy lines, elevating our military to new heights."

NYAB_BJR_order_reform:"Invite Sufi Orders"
NYAB_BJR_order_reform_desc:"The mystical Sufi Orders walk the path of Allah - we should invite them to practice their spiritual ways in our lands."

NYAB_BJR_rusgov_adm_reform:"Bolghar-Saqaliba Administration"
NYAB_BJR_rusgov_adm_reform_desc:"After centuries of integration, Bolghars have gradually adopted more centralized administrative structures. While Saqaliba now fill many government positions, they remain supervised by Bolghars - or Tatars where Bolghars are unavailable."

NYAB_BJR_genaishi_reform:"Bolghar Divan System"
NYAB_BJR_genaishi_reform_desc:"'Divan' meaning council or assembly. Our expanding Bolghar territories can no longer be governed single-handedly as in the past. With Saqaliba frequently complaining of neglect and clashing with Bolghar nobles, we should establish an assembly where Saqaliba elect representatives to negotiate matters with the nobility in the capital."


NYAB_BJR_mahedi_reform:"Reaffirm Mahdist Zeal"
NYAB_BJR_mahedi_reform_desc:"The Mahdist Spirit (or Messianic Fervor) emerged from our position between nominal Muslim Rus' and outright pagans - this sense of being Allah's chosen people tasked with spreading the true faith worldwide has become our salvational ideology."

NYAB_BJR_war_vs_heathen_reform:"Global Jihad"
NYAB_BJR_war_vs_heathen_reform_desc:"As Eastern Europe's besieged Muslim state, we will end centuries of defensive warfare by launching jihad outward! As Allah's elect, we shall carry the true faith to all corners of the world!"

NYAB_BJR_fengjian_adm_reform_ttt:"Implemented §YBolghar Khanate§! Reforms"
NYAB_BJR_horde_adm_reform:"Maintain Autonomous Territories"
NYAB_BJR_horde_adm_reform_desc:"Given the khanate's limited capacity to govern vast lands directly, delegating authority to local administrators remains the optimal solution."

NYAB_BJR_absolute_adm_reform:"Collaborative Governance"
NYAB_BJR_absolute_adm_reform_desc:"Even rulers cannot manage such burdens alone. By cooperating with domestic estates - delegating responsibilities while preserving royal authority - we achieve both efficiency and control."

NYAB_GOL_ulus_reform:"Jochid Ulus"
NYAB_GOL_ulus_reform_desc:"Originally founded by Batu Khan, son of Jochi, this ulus holds the most legitimate claim among Eastern European khanates as territory personally granted by Genghis Khan. Now adopting European feudal innovations, our khanate will reach new heights!"

NYAB_GOL_dada_noble_reform:"Bolghar Nobility"

NYAB_GOL_use_persian_reform:"Employ Persian Bureaucrats"

NYAB_GOL_improve_daluhuachi_reform:"Strengthen the Darughachi"

NYAB_GOL_reform_hulitai_reform:"Reform the Kurultai"

NYAB_KAZ_freedom_title:"Defy the Great Khan"
NYAB_KAZ_freedom_desc:"The Mongol Empire brought us destruction, yet its glory was undeniable. But this so-called 'Golden Horde'? Cowards! We've bided our time in Kazan too long! Whether to conquer Eastern Europe or restore Mongol glory, we've no reason to remain under their rule!"

NYAB_KAZ_break_GLH_rule_title:"Depose the Weak Khan"

NYAB_KAZ_march_into_salai_desc:"Sarai - meaning 'palace' - this jewel built with wealth from Persia to Cathay, praised by Islamic travelers as the greatest city, now lies in our hands. The cowardly Golden Khan has fled to parts unknown. Compared to our mighty Khan, he was never worthy to gaze upon this city!"

NYAB_KAZ_subject_CRI_title:"Subjugate Crimea"
NYAB_KAZ_subject_CRI_desc:"In this contest, the Crimeans embraced Christianity - sealing their doom! For the Bolghars fight with Allah's blessing!"

NYAB_KAZ_subject_NOG_title:"Tame the Nogai Horde"

NYAB_KAZ_russia_war_title:"Intervene in Rus' Wars"
NYAB_KAZ_russia_war_desc:"The Rus' continue their petty squabbles - how tiresome. Even Mongol-Church cooperation couldn't curb their warlords' ambitions. We must act before they unite!"

NYAB_KAZ_1_t: "Future of the Bolghars"
NYAB_KAZ_1_d: "Centuries have passed since Great Bulgaria was shattered by the Khazars and the Bolghar people were divided. In this time, we Bolghars have tasted bitter suffering - first becoming vassals of the Khaganate, forced to pay exorbitant tribute and send hostages to Atil. Even distant Rus and Ugric merchants had to export their furs to the Khazars.\n\nUntil the Bolghars sought aid from the Caliph, and Allah's messengers brought us faith and protection. Thus we avoided being carved up by the Khaganate. Later, when the Khazar Khanate was partitioned, the Bolghars briefly became masters of these steppes and a hub of trade. But our respite was short-lived - Cumans and Mongols came in waves. As Eastern Europe's only Islamic state, we Bolghars cowered near the fortress of Kazan, unable to sleep soundly.\n\nNow, our time has come. The Golden Horde crumbles while the Rus states remain divided. In Allah's name, we shall launch jihad against the infidels!"

NYAB_KAZ_1a: "I shall become Sultan of the Saqaliba!"
NYAB_KAZ_1b: "As descendant of Genghis Khan, I claim the Ulus of Jochi!"
NYAB_KAZ_1a_tt: "The Saqaliba - those who call themselves @RUS Rus - now stand deeply divided, presenting our perfect opportunity. Ancient @BOG Bolghar rulers were called '§YKings of Saqaliba§!', and now we must drive our authority like an iron nail into their souls. Let us conquer these slaves and make §GAllah's light§! shine upon the Saqaliba!\n"
NYAB_KAZ_1b_tt: "The boundless steppe has always been our ancestors' hunting ground. Now we have crushed the so-called Khan in Sarai. Without doubt, this marks our beginning to grasp the steppe in our fist. We shall sweep across the grasslands, crush all rivals, proclaim our lineage from Genghis and Jochi Khan, and make the steppe bow to our rule. Rebuilding the glory of @GOL§YJochi Ulus§! is our sacred duty!\n"

NYAB_KAZ_2_t: "Convene the Kurultai"
NYAB_KAZ_2_d: "The old steppe order burns in restless flames as [Root.Monarch.GetName] establishes the new. All tribes dare not disobey Khan [Root.Monarch.GetName], coming to Sarai to pay homage. Seizing this moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName] declares himself the true Khan of Jochi Ulus, destined to restore the Mongol Empire's glory - making neighboring nations tremble in fear once more! Let them remember the terror of Mongol domination!"
NYAB_KAZ_2a: "I! Am the new Khan!"

NYAB_KAZ_3_t: "The Destruction of Kiev"
NYAB_KAZ_3_d: "We should have done this centuries ago. But Khan Batu was merciful, unable to bear seeing the Rus suffer, so he granted them respite. Yet the Rus betrayed this trust - while paying lip service to the Great Khan, they committed atrocities in his name, bullying the weak and disgracing our authority.\n\nAs the steppes burned, they swiftly declared independence, seeking to throw off our rule. But we men of the saddle take pride in our bloodlust! We shall clamp our shackles upon them once more!"
NYAB_KAZ_3a: "Crush their rebellious spirit!"

NYAB_KAZ_4_t: "Return Once More!"
NYAB_KAZ_4_d: "In 1241, Khan Batu's Mongol armies crushed the Holy Roman Empire's coalition. The Western Campaign halted only due to news of the Great Khan's death. Now we've reached the furthest extent of that ancient conquest, defeating these so-called 'Roman Empire' forces again. They're utterly worthless!"
NYAB_KAZ_4a: "We departed once - now we return!"

NYAB_KAZ_5_t: "Mongol Reunification"
NYAB_KAZ_5_d: "After campaigning across ten thousand li without respite, we've finally returned to the Mongolian steppe - the homeland of our dreams. Even the fiercest warriors, men who've lived their whole lives in the saddle, find their eyes moistening. Yet the steppe tribes view our arrival with suspicion, doubting we're true Mongols. This has caused uproar in our ranks. Some argue we must follow the Chinese custom of 'fallen leaves returning to roots,' while others say perhaps we should let the homeland remain a legend - our present situation is good enough."
NYAB_KAZ_5a: "Ultimately, the Mongolian steppe is our true home."
NYAB_KAZ_5a_tt: "\nUnify all §YTatar§! culture group as §YTatar§! culture.\n"

NYAB_KAZ_5b_tt: "\nUnify §YOirat, Khalkha, Khorchin,§! and §YBuryat§! cultures as §YMongol§! culture.\n"

NYAB_KAZ_6_t: "Contending for the Mongol Empire's Legacy"
NYAB_KAZ_6_d: "When [Root.GetName]'s armies stormed Dadu, the enemy had already fled. This city stands as one of the Mongol Empire's greatest legacies. From here, we could again march south to reconquer the Han. But lessons from the past have made many question whether to adopt Han traditions. Yet the undeniable truth remains - the Mandate of Heaven holds irresistible allure for any Khan, offering rule over the world's most populous realm. Now the final decision rests with the Khan, as all tribes stand ready to follow [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lead."
NYAB_KAZ_6a: "The Khan is the Son of Heaven!"
NYAB_KAZ_6a_tt: "We have chosen the §MSinicization§! path. This will affect future mission requirements and rewards, which you can preview in the mission tree. §RThis choice cannot be changed§!.\n"

NYAB_KAZ_6b_tt: "We have chosen the §OTraditional§! path. This will affect future mission requirements and rewards, which you can preview in the mission tree. §RThis choice cannot be changed§!.\n"

NYAB_KAZ_7_t: "Reestablish the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs"
NYAB_KAZ_7_d: "Following the Yuan dynasty's administrative system, Dadu once housed this special bureau governing Tibetan regions. We could revive this institution or rule these lands directly."
NYAB_KAZ_7a: "Establish the Bureau."
NYAB_KAZ_7b: "Our direct rule suffices."

NYAB_KAZ_8_t: "Proclaim a New Era"
NYAB_KAZ_8_d: "Having seized the Mandate of Heaven, the Khan now formally becomes the Son of Heaven - heir to this ancient celestial dynasty. The Khan bears responsibility not only to Mongol brethren but to all under heaven. The time has come to proclaim a new era."
NYAB_KAZ_8a: "Great is the Qian Yuan! All things originate from Heaven, which governs all!" #[Yuan dynasty reference]
NYAB_KAZ_8b: "Great is the Qian Yuan... As the Great Ming completes the cycle, the six positions form in time, riding six dragons to command Heaven. We proclaim the Great Ming." #[Ming dynasty reference]
NYAB_KAZ_8c: "Borjigin means 'blue eyes.' Blue connects to cyan (qing), and cyan extracts purity (qing). Thus we proclaim the Great Qing." #[Qing dynasty reference]
NYAB_KAZ_8d: "We need not follow these traditions!"

NYAB_KAZ_9_t: "Rescue the Caliph"
NYAB_KAZ_9_d: "Since the Abbasid Caliph's defeat by the Mongols, he has remained in Egypt as the Nizzari dynasty's puppet. After capturing Cairo, we freed the Caliph from his gilded cage. Humbly, he begged us to grant him rule over Egypt in exchange for legitimizing our conquests."
NYAB_KAZ_9a: "In Allah's name, I grant you the privilege of collecting taxes for me."
NYAB_KAZ_9b: "Hah! You're nothing but a Mongol's dog!"

NYAB_KAZ_10_t: "Incorporate the Rajput Regiments"
NYAB_KAZ_10_d: "While Rajput warriors may not be the most skilled we've encountered, the Khan is ever-merciful and compassionate. Regarding their request to join our armies in exchange for privileges, the Khan naturally..."
NYAB_KAZ_10a: "Welcome them into our ranks!"
NYAB_KAZ_10b: "We have no need for these fellows!"

NYAB_KAZ_11_t: "The Fall of Novgorod"
NYAB_KAZ_11_d: "Novgorod has fallen. The nobles hastily drafted surrender documents, forcing their [NOV.Monarch.GetTitle] to capitulate. [Root.Monarch.GetName] rode triumphantly into this Slavic city - renowned as Eastern Europe's commercial jewel - to negotiate with local aristocrats."
NYAB_KAZ_11a: "Annex key cities, grant autonomy to the rest."
NYAB_KAZ_11b: "We demand full annexation, promising short-term autonomy and tax exemptions."
NYAB_KAZ_11b_tt: "\nCore provinces in §YNovgorod§! will receive:"

NYAB_KAZ_12_d: "\"For Bolghar independence and revival, we must abolish your privileges.\" As the Emir declared, this was necessary. The princes bowed their heads - accepting, or rather, compelled to accept. Now a single command from the Emir..."
NYAB_KAZ_12a: "Unify Bolghar-Rus'!"
