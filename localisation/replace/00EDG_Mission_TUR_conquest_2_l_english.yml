EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Wars between the post-Fatimid dynasties, the Marinids, the Almohads, and the Frankish Crusaders have brought poverty and chaos to the Maghreb region. The western frontier of Islam is naught but ashes, urgently in need of salvation by the Ottoman Empire."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_2_title:0 "Secure Tunisia"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The Frankish Crusaders of centuries past destroyed Ifriqiya and ravaged the holy city of Kairouan, a page of shame in the history of the Muslim world. We must expel the Tunisian Crusaders and restore the glory of this land."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_4_title:0 "Subdue Algiers"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_4_desc:0 "Algiers and the Barbary Coast have largely served as safe havens for Maghrebi Muslim pirates since the Middle Ages. As long as their targets are our Christian enemies, the actions of the Algerians and Barbary corsairs benefit us. However, compared to our old Frankish rivals, the efficiency of these Berber tribesmen, long accustomed to peace under post-Fatimid rule, is... lacking. Yet if the founding principles of their state were employed by us, the destruction they could cause would hold far greater significance."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_5_title:0 "Disintegrate Morocco"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_5_desc:0 "The success of the Reconquista has placed Morocco in an extremely perilous position, and the heretical Almohad Caliphate further seeks to deviate from mainstream Islam. As devout Muslims, it is our duty to take control of this land, freeing it from the clutches of the Christian kingdoms and Berber brotherhoods."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_8_title:0 "Land at Palermo"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_8_desc:0 "Sicily lies southwest of the Apennine Peninsula. In Greek, its ancient name 'Trinacria' means 'three-pointed,' resembling the stumbling block on the boot of Italy extending into the Mediterranean. It is the largest island in the Mediterranean. Vast, fertile, with a warm climate and beautiful scenery, it abounds in citrus, lemons, and olive trees. Due to its favorable natural environment for agriculture and forestry, it has historically been called the 'Golden Basin.' After the Byzantines, taking advantage of Norman internal strife, conquered Sicily and established their rule, the island came under Orthodox Christian governance. But soon, we shall conquer this land bestowed by Allah upon the Muslims."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_9_title:0 "The Counter Reconquista" # The Anti-Reconquista
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_1_9_desc:0 "In 711, the Umayyad Caliphate invaded Iberia, destroying the Visigothic Kingdom by 714, and thus al-Andalus was incorporated into the Muslim world. However, in 756, the fugitive Umayyad prince Abd al-Rahman I established a separate state in Córdoba, founding the Emirate of Córdoba (later the Caliphate of Córdoba). Since then, al-Andalus has been split from a unified Caliphate for nearly 800 years.\n\nReligious strife persists across Iberia to this day. Let us intervene decisively to end the Reconquista and the Counter-Reconquista, personally uniting Al-Andalus and restoring the Caliphate to its former, glorious borders."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_2_title:0 "Conquer Tabriz"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Iranians are accustomed to being ruled by various empires, first the Greeks, then the Rightly Guided Caliphate, followed by the Seljuks, Khwarezm, and the Ilkhanate. The most recent was Timur, whose sinister power nearly trampled the hills of Anatolia. Even if their power has dimmed over the last century, this ancient land may still give birth to a new empire; a Persian lion that might attempt to challenge us. We must strike first and conquer our eastern frontier once and for all."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_3_title:0 "Rome and Persia"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_3_desc:0 "The fall of the Safavids extinguished the last flicker of light for the revival of an Iranian empire. The Persians are no longer sufficient to pose a threat to Rome, and the unification of the Muslim faith is within sight. However, the territories beyond the Zagros Mountains remain difficult to govern. We may need to establish another new province to assist the empire in administering Persia."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_5_title:0 "End the Shaybanids"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_5_desc:0 "The Uzbek invasion sent Persia, already teetering on the edge after Timur's conquests, over the cliff. Today, the descendants of Khaerkhan still influence the order of eastern Iran. As the new King of Kings, we must completely expel the Shaybanid tribe and bring the jewel of Persia—Khorasan—under our rule as well."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_7_title:0 "Invade Europe"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_7_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is, to true Romans, nothing but a disgraceful false dynasty. To call their system dysfunctional is already to flatter them. We shall once again destroy a false dynasty that covets the true Roman legal heritage. The Holy Roman Empire—the empire in name only—shall perish today!"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_8_title:0 "Invade Venice"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_8_desc:0 "The cunning Venetians have long troubled us. Previously, we lacked sufficient opportunity to punish them. Now, we shall hang the Doge of Venice, appoint a new administrator, transform the former Doge's Palace into the Pasha's Palace, and achieve a high degree of control over Venice."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_9_title:0 "Alatíníyǎ"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_2_9_desc:0 "The tragedy of the Byzantine Empire does not mean that there is no longer a true Roman Empire in this world. The Ottoman Empire is its rightful successor, chosen by Allah. Therefore, ruling the heart of the old Roman Empire is our divinely ordained mandate—to rule the great city of Rome!"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_1_title:0 "The New Ottoman Era"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_1_desc:0 "From Osman I's declaration of independence to Orhan's establishment of the state, from Mehmed 'the Conqueror's' rebuilding of the empire to Selim 'the Grim's' swallowing of Egypt whole, the Ottoman dynasty's momentum of expansion has been unparalleled. The empire has flourished under the rule of nine sagacious sovereigns and has now entered its zenith, poised to launch conquests toward even more distant frontiers. This is 'the New Ottoman Era.'"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_2_title:0 "At the Gates of Baghdad"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_2_desc:0 "When the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entered Baghdad, she had already shed the smoke of the day's battle. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] strolled through this historic city, a myriad of emotions welled up within him.\n\nBaghdad, as the heart of the Caliphate, has witnessed the glory and decline of countless conquerors. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] held deep respect for the great conquerors who had left their mark on this land. He held a solemn memorial ceremony, reminiscing about the heroes who had shone brightly in the long river of history. During the ceremony, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] envisioned how the Persian Shah Xerxes the Great conquered many corners of the world with his boundless wealth and powerful armies, and how the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan established the splendor of the Seljuk Empire in Baghdad.\n\nThe night grew late, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] encountered these giants of history in his dreams. Shah Xerxes the Great was clad in splendid battle robes, holding a scepter inlaid with jewels, while Sultan Alp Arslan rode a warhorse, armored and majestic. The two emperors showed the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] their paths of conquest in the dream, sharing their wisdom and power.\n\nAs the two conquerors cried out, 'You shall rule the entire world,' the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] abruptly awoke.\n\nWhen the first light of dawn pierced the clouds, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] startled awake, sitting up from the feather bed, finding it hard to calm himself for a moment. He knew he must not only inherit the legacy of his predecessors but also inscribe new chapters in his own era. He would continue to expand the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, pushing its glory to new heights."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_4_desc:0 "Hormuz controls the strategic throat of the Persian Gulf, overseeing the vast trade network between the Middle East and overseas, and connecting the supply lines between Persia and Arabia, holding immense strategic value. By controlling Hormuz, our nation can not only secure a significant position in commerce and ensure economic prosperity but also sever the maritime communication between the Safavid Empire and its European allies, imposing an economic blockade on Persia."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_8_desc:0 "The House of Habsburg has long obstructed our ambitions in Europe. Now, our glorious armies stand before the city gates, awaiting only the signal to begin the siege of the Habsburgs' seat of power—Vienna, the Gate to Europe."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_9_title:0 "Annihilate the Habsburgs"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_3_9_desc:0 "The House of Habsburg has reached its end. Did their ancestor Rudolf I, when he was crowned with the false imperial diadem 300 years ago, ever foresee this day? Did he foresee how his descendants would grovel before the Ottoman [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], trembling with fear to serve as court jesters for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], receiving that meager and humiliating income?"

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_2_title:0 "The Origin of Sahada" # The Former Capital of Sahada
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_2_desc:0 "Sahada rose from a small state to rule Egypt, swallow Arabia whole, and then collapse in a thunderous fall, all within seventy or eighty years. Even as detestable heretics, their swift rise and fall is a matter for sighing. Now, standing before the former capital of the Sahada dynasty, we should pay our respects to this once-mighty regime, learn from its governance, and ensure the Ottoman Empire's lasting prosperity."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_3_title:0 "Al-Hasa and Oman"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_3_desc:0 "For centuries, many tribes and minor states around the Persian Gulf have fought over mere inches of land. The people of Al-Hasa, who shelter remnants of the Qarmatians, and the remnants of the Kharijites in Oman are prime examples. The Ottoman Padishah is the sole Caliph of the Islamic world and should punish heresy, unifying eastern Arabia."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_5_title:0 "The Crimean Mandate"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_5_desc:0 "The Crimean Khanate lies across the Black Sea. Once-feared nomadic warriors have now succumbed to the test of time. The Rus' and Greeks have defeated the Khan, taking his followers and lands. This is indeed a dark hour for the Crimean Khans, but it is also a perfect opportunity for our nation to expand its influence northward—let us reclaim the northern frontier of Islam and discipline the Orthodox Christians."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_7_title:0 "Invade India"
EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_7_desc:0 "We have done it! We have finally reached India. We stand on the threshold of a path of conquest in the East surpassing even that of Alexander the Great. However, to focus solely on conquest would be folly. India is a wealthy subcontinent, and we should devote some attention to directing these riches towards our heartlands in the West. If we wish to claim a share of India's commercial wealth, we must assert control over and lay claim to many of its core regions."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_8_desc:0 "The great ports of Gujarat are not only among the world's busiest trade centers but also the embarkation points for tens of thousands of Indian Muslims journeying to the Holy Cities of Arabia. Conquering Gujarat is an imperial mission to ensure our Indian subjects can undertake the most important journey of their lives—the Hajj—just like our other citizens. At the same time, the valiant and martial Rajput princes here can serve as 'fuel' for the empire's war machine."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_4_9_desc:0 "The Marathas are one of the most martial peoples in India. Unlike the zealously orthodox Hindu Rajputs, a considerable number of Marathas have already converted to Islam and joined the Ottoman Janissaries, entrusted with important responsibilities by His Majesty the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. These high-ranking Janissaries of Maratha origin now propose to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that their compatriots be formally integrated into our administrative system, which will allow us to rule India more effectively."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_5_3_desc:0 "The Georgian lands have witnessed dozens of major campaigns throughout history. The centuries-long contention between Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire here proves it is a natural frontier suited for great powers. Now, the Iranians are once again courting Georgian princes, just as they did a millennium ago. As the de facto heirs of the Byzantine Empire, we must put a stop to their machinations."

EDG_Mission_TUR_conquest_2_mission_5_5_desc:0 "After the ancient Turkic Khaganates, many forces attempted to dominate the steppes, none more successful than the Mongols. But today, the descendants of the Golden Horde cling to life in Sarai, anxiously defending against the armies of the Rus. We cannot allow these cowards to share the name 'Tengri's Favored' with their ancestors—it is undoubtedly an insult to the Turkic peoples!

When necessary, we shall choose to burn and plunder—everything of theirs belongs to us!"
