The wealthy Holland ultimately changed hands, and we, utterly defeated, could only bide our time in the impoverished Overijssel. Now the Wittelsbachs are fragmented, and the usurper stands isolated and unsupported. Let us correct the error of 1341 and reaffirm the inheritance rights of the House of Gerulfingen."

EDG_H04_mission_2_9_desc:0 "The Euchites emerged around 370 AD. Their core doctrine reflects a unique hedonistic philosophy, with adherents keen on orgies and even acts that somewhat transgress moral norms. The Euchites persisted for centuries. Due to the spread of the Black Death, the failure of the Albigensian Crusade, and the ensuing great upheaval in the Catholic world, Euchitism, sharing many similarities with Catharism, spread rapidly in Germania. Many from the lower classes suffering immense social pressure and the upper classes indulging in hedonism were drawn to this doctrine advocating human liberation. Many lords also believed that tacitly allowing the increase of Euchite followers could bolster the population in their territories. Meanwhile, the Papacy and other bishops, facing the challenge of Cathar and Waldensian diffusion, set aside dealing with the Euchites, a sect less inclined to advocate overthrowing oppression or breaking from the Papacy. Thus, Euchitism developed fully in the shadows with little obstruction. Now, as our territory expands, we must carefully consider how to handle the Euchite issue within our realm."
