EDG_flavorEGY_reform.1.t:0 "Visitors"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.1.d:0 "Since the Grand Malik demanded the weakening of Mamluk influence, many Mamluks within the country have been unsettled. While the Royal Mamluks holding power still see bustling activity at their doors, and Cairo remains bathed in sunlight and illuminated by lamps, vested interests cannot shake off the memory of the peacock cooked that night and the Grand Malik's endless speech.\n\nWhat is even more unsettling is that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] continues to show immense enthusiasm for this political reform. For several consecutive days, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has spent considerable time in discussions with private advisors about which groups could be introduced into our government as part of the political reforms. They often converse late into the night, with candles in the room burning until dawn. It is as though by bringing in groups historically excluded from politics into our government, we could become stronger.\n\nSoon, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issued two decrees—one establishing several military districts called "Nomes" across the nation, with their military commanders being Greek officers directly appointed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]; the other decree refined various regulations prohibiting the persecution of Copts and expanded opportunities for Copts to engage in governance.\n\nOn another day, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned two delegations—one led by a robust Greek mercenary officer, the other by an eloquent Coptic bishop. Many Mamluk officers were puzzled by the arrival of these two groups until [Root.Monarch.GetName] announced the new decrees."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.1.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to expand the Greek Corps."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.1.b:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will graciously grant Copts more rights."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.1.c:0 "The Mamluk advisors will strive to maintain the status quo."
 
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.2.t:0 "A Vacant Seat Awaits"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.2.d:0 "The Diwan Council has always been the center of power in our state. Every seat in the Diwan represents immense authority, and many Royal Mamluks covet these positions intensely. On this day, the Diwan convened once more, but as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] slowly rose, capturing the attention of all council members, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] solemnly announced that there would be a new member joining the Diwan."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.2.a:0 "There is no better choice than a Greek officer."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.2.b:0 "A senior Coptic minister rightfully deserves a seat in the council."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.2.c:0 "The seat naturally belongs to a Royal Mamluk."

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.3.t:0 "The Nome Issue"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.3.d:0 "Since the establishment of the 'Nome' military districts, local military authority is no longer solely in the hands of regional [Root.GetAdjective] governors. As Nome commanders are mostly Greek officers directly appointed by the central government, they represent the will of the central authority, especially that of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, this has also brought many problems. Nome commanders often struggle to counterbalance regional [Root.GetAdjective] authorities on major issues, making the system of checks and balances less effective. Some Greek officers in the Nomes have proposed expanding the Greek corps within the Nomes, claiming this would strengthen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s voice in local affairs and introduce more high-quality military resources."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.3.a:0 "Let it be done."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.3.b:0 "Perhaps we should seek the opinion of the Copts..."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.3.c:0 "They should submit to the local [Root.GetAdjective] authorities."
 
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.4.t:0 "The Copts' Request"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.4.d:0 "Although legislation protecting Coptic rights continues to be issued, theoretically strengthening their safeguards, there are always cunning local officials who know how to 'study and apply the law,' even enacting new local regulations to legally persecute, exploit, and oppress Copts across the land. These are not recent issues but longstanding malignant tumors within the state, difficult to excise. Moreover, the recent expansion of protections for Copts has provoked hostility from other groups, intensifying and widening the scope of these malpractices. Some wealthy Coptic merchants and clergy have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to establish a nationwide Coptic Council, bringing together Copts with political and economic power to ensure their rights are not violated."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.4.a:0 "The Greeks will not like this."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.4.b:0 "This is only right."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.4.c:0 "But this is a topic that must not be touched."

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.5.t:0 "Debate"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.5.d:0 "As Greeks and Copts gain increasing political influence, conflicts between them have inevitably arisen. One morning, while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was inspecting the city, they witnessed a Greek officer and a Coptic bishop arguing over which people was superior. Their heated exchange drew a crowd of onlookers, and the dispute showed no sign of abating until they noticed the arrival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They humbly bowed and begged [Root.Monarch.GetName] for forgiveness. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] clearly also wished to offer some perspective on the matter."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.5.a:0 "The Greeks are naturally superior."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.5.b:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] favors the Copts more."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.5.c:0 "You are both merely servants of the [Root.GetName]!"

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.6.t:0 "Illustrated Books and Hymns"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.6.d:0 "Master Zayd from the Hejaz is not a fervent Muslim. He appreciates Greek rhetoric and is well-versed in Persian poetry. More importantly, he is an exceptional artist, skilled in creating exquisite illustrated books and composing elegant, polished verses with refined rhetoric. Recently, some [Root.GetAdjective] officers brought Master Zayd to the court of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], recommending him to create works for the ruler. Master Zayd proposed that he is willing to serve any group, even the Orthodox Greeks, as long as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] tells him where his talents should be directed."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.6.a:0 "Reward the excellent Nome Greek officers."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.6.b:0 "Grant them to the diligent Coptic bureaucrats."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.6.c:0 "These shall belong solely to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.7.t:0 "Directorate of Finance"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.7.d:0 "The Copts have proposed to [Root.Monarch.GetName] the establishment of a central-led Directorate of Finance to meet the needs of our land and fiscal reforms. After enduring so much internal turmoil, creating a more mature fiscal and taxation system is indeed an urgent necessity. We must appoint the right individuals for this task."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.7.a:0 "The Greeks are quite skilled in such matters."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.7.b:0 "Appoint a Coptic bureaucrat."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.7.c:0 "We have our own candidates."

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.8.t:0 "A New Administrative Focus"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.8.d:0 "Handling government organizational affairs has never been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s forte. Clearly, relying solely on [Root.Monarch.GetName] is insufficient to fully manage these intricate matters. The mark of an excellent leader in compensating for such weaknesses is to delegate to others. And our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is doing precisely that—moreover, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has many choices.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to infuse some Greek and Coptic elements into the government's operational mechanisms, even explicitly stating that the administrative focus may shift—according to the desires of the appointed individuals."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.8.a:0 "I hear the Greeks are planning to attract more merchants."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.8.b:0 "The Coptic proposal for land and fiscal reform is more enticing."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.8.c:0 "Maximizing revenue is the very purpose of government."

EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.t:0 "Vacancies in Local Government"
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.desc:0 "In [Root.GetName], not all local bureaucrats understand the true implications of their corrupt actions. In the past, many Emirs and Mamluks, tempted by money, treated the people as expendable and engaged in self-serving schemes with other powerful figures. In [Root.GetName], integrity has almost completely vanished, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] yearns to change this reality. Recently, some spies attempted to undermine our administrative institutions through bribery and extortion. They expected assistance from corrupt officials but were instead reported alongside those officials. After beheading and publicly displaying these traitors, [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that numerous vacancies have once again appeared within the local government."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.a:0 "We shall let the Greeks join this game."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.b:0 "The Copts are more trustworthy."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.c:0 "The Mamluks are the right and left arms of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
EDG_flavorEGY_reform.9.d:0 "We must rely on the Emirs."
