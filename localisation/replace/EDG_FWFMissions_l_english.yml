It's not just that European empires greedily plunder resources from across the world; princes and nobles also seize wealth and food from those who truly need it. They fill their coffers and satisfy their appetites at the cost of others' suffering. We cannot sit idly by as such a canker corrodes the people's soul. All goods will be allocated according to need, no more and no less. If everyone takes only what they need, the vice of gluttony will cease to exist."

EDG_FWF_mission_2_32_desc:0 "Though we are most reluctant to admit it, wrath is perhaps the most useful of the Seven Deadly Sins. It is an extremely powerful emotion, leaving ruins in its wake after it is unleashed. Sometimes, even after enduring immense suffering, people continue to turn to wrath, merely to fill an inner void, or perhaps just to have a purpose. Occasional anger is no problem and entirely understandable, but it cannot be allowed to destroy everything. We will not destroy wrath as we do other cancers; instead, we will filter out its impurities and control it for our own use. In times of peace, exercise restraint and composure; in times of war, open the floodgates and vent its fury."

Sloth makes people complacent, thinking everything should be left to others. Wrath only breeds crime and conflict; we must only suppress enemies who threaten the motherland. Envy is the source of discrimination and class prejudice. Finally, Pride leads people to overvalue their own contributions. The nation and its people suffer deeply from these seven sins; we must address them one by one."

This could be pride in their work, pride in success, or pride for a united and happy family. Celebrating one's own achievements and feeling proud of them is completely reasonable and understandable. However, we cannot allow the arrogant among them to rise to prominence, creating an atmosphere of personality cult around themselves. From politics to personal life, Pride breeds Envy, allowing injustice to take root. All can be proud of their own achievements; each will receive fair compensation. Let us nip the problems of Pride and Envy in the bud."

EDG_FWF_mission_4_30_desc:0 "Greed, quite similar to Gluttony, is a persistent illness of imperialist thought. On a national level, Greed is the leader's craving for power, territory, and the unwilling acclaim of the people. However, Greed at the regional level is even worse. Hoarding wealth leads to class stratification, which in turn gives rise to class discrimination and the gap between rich and poor. Greed drives people to seize what others need, and we cannot stand idly by. Property shall be distributed according to need, the landlord class eliminated, and everyone ensured the materials they require to earn their livelihood, preventing the accumulation of wealth in one place. Our greatest enemy may well be Greed, and we must redouble our efforts to eradicate it."
