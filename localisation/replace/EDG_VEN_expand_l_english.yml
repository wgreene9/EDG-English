EDG_flavorVEN_shirenhui_expand.1.desc:0 "Since the incompetence and excessive delegation of authority by Francesco Steno Dandolo, the power of the Council of Ten has continuously expanded, eventually seizing substantial authority in Venice. Realizing this, a life-and-death political struggle ensued between the Dandolo family and the Council of Ten. Unfortunately, due to the §Gweakness§! and §Gcompromising nature§! of the Venetian authorities and the Dandolo family (§Gcaused by choosing any compromising option in the Council of Ten disaster event chain§!), this counter-offensive against the Council of Ten failed. The Council of Ten still firmly controls a significant portion of the Venetian government, and has even progressed further, now wielding twice the actual power it held during the period of intense struggle (§GThis means you will suffer a permanent penalty twice as severe as the Council of Ten disaster modifier§!)."
