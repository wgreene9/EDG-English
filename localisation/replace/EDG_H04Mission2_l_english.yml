EDG_H04_mission_expand_5_40_desc:0 "The East African coast is dotted with wealthy trading cities. Merchants from Persia and India come here to buy gold and ivory, bringing their cloth and manufactured goods in return. Countless spices and other valuable trade items are exchanged and transshipped here, entering the Near East and even the Mediterranean world. Whether to bring these riches to the homeland of [Root.GetName] or to solidify the eastern sea route, making it another eastern station after [1177.GetName] to provide continuous supplies for our fleets, we must plan and develop this region."

Valuable dyes, exquisite silks, and rare spices continuously pass through Hormuz, eventually reaching the markets of Samarkand, Aleppo, and Alexandria, transforming into boundless wealth. We must control the Persian Gulf—this nexus connecting the nations of Central Asia—by monopolizing the trade of this region to grasp its economic lifeline, thereby controlling the Persian states and even influencing the Central Asian steppes."
