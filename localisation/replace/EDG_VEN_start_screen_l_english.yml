During the Middle Ages, it gradually developed into one of the major powers in the Mediterranean. Protracted trade disputes with the §YByzantine Empire§! culminated in the Fourth Crusade of 1204 and the sack of Constantinople. This dealt a severe blow to §YByzantium§! while vastly expanding Venice's §Y'Stato da Màr'§!—overseas territories like §YCrete§! and §YNegroponte§!.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade of 1204 also fundamentally altered the internal political structure of the §YRepublic of Venice§!, along with the fate of the §YHouse of Dandolo§!. Before the Fourth Crusade, Venice was a commercial republic. Due to its long involvement in Mediterranean trade, the great merchant families within the city had almost monopolized the state's wealth. By electing the §YDoge of Venice§! from among the most powerful merchant families, the merchants, guilds, and plutocrats controlled the Venetian Republic. However, after the Fourth Crusade, everything changed. The §YDoge§! who led the Fourth Crusade, Enrico Dandolo, was a dedicated and virtuous leader under whose command the Venetians achieved their most remarkable victory in the most perilous times. His descendants, likewise talented, long held Venetian power, gradually transforming the title of §Y'Doge of Venice'§! into a hereditary ducal position. The §YHouse of Dandolo§! abolished the restriction preventing the Doge from marrying foreigners and steadily infiltrated every corner of the state. Ultimately, a single family grasped all power, turning Venice into a de facto monarchy.\n\nThe great victory of the Fourth Crusade also struck another traditional rival of Venice: the other commercial republic at the opposite end of the Apennine Peninsula, §YGenoa§!. After the occupation of Constantinople, Genoa's trade opportunities in the East severely diminished. For decades, minor conflicts and disputes between Genoa and Venice continued, culminating in the §YWar of Saint Sabas§! from 1256 to 1258, where Venice and its allies ultimately emerged victorious. In the following century from 1253 to 1381, four major wars erupted between Venice and Genoa. Venice finally defeated Genoa decisively in the §YWar of Chioggia§!, seizing trade hegemony over the entire Mediterranean and leaping to become the greatest holder of wealth in the region.\n\n§YRecent History§!\n\nSince the ascension of the current monarch, §GFrancesco Steno Dandolo§!, the §YVenetian Monarchy§! has been in continuous decline. Francesco Dandolo, the current head of the House of Dandolo and nominal ruler of the Venetians, would never have become Doge of Venice were it not for the Red Death. However, the tide of plague swept across the world, making the orderly succession to the Doge's throne an almost hopeless task—who knew who was alive and who was dead? In the end, Francesco became the Doge. The past decade has been fraught with disasters for Venice: its territory has shrunk, its overseas influence has waned, and even domestically, many anti-monarchist uprisings have erupted. Venice leveraged prestige and wealth to attract foreign powers and establish good relations with numerous nations. But despite all efforts, Venice still has powerful enemies to confront. In the past, §YGenoa§!, spanning the Italian peninsula, coveted Venetian control over Mediterranean trade, envisioning nothing more than seeing this vast maritime empire crumble and disintegrate. After the §YWar of Chioggia§! in 1381, Genoa was no longer qualified to be Venice's rival, but that did not mean Venice could rest easy. The §YDuchy of Lombardy§!, separated from Venice by mountains, rose rapidly after Genoa's decline. Unlike Genoa, Lombardy directly threatened Venice's security on the Apennine Peninsula itself and had long been Venice's rival in the Italian power struggle. However, since the legendary figure §YDuke Filippo of Lombardy§! took power, Venice has suffered defeats in both diplomatic negotiations and military conflicts, losing direct control over the important cities of §YBergamo§! and §YBrescia§!. In recent years, it even lost control over §YVerona§!, a city in the heart of Venetian territory. The merchants of Verona, allied with anti-monarchists and incited by Duke Filippo of Lombardy, declared independence and established the §YRepublic of Verona§!, which has now become a de facto vassal of Lombardy. The only noteworthy achievement might be the Dandolo family's dispatch of troops in 1440 to control the central Italian city of §YRavenna§!, which had attempted to break away from §YPapal State§! rule, and the subsequent establishment of Venetian rule there.\n\nUpon his accession, Francesco once harbored grand ambitions, eager to achieve great things. However, a series of military and diplomatic setbacks severely shattered his faith and will. He then immersed himself in elusive religious pursuits, traveling with mendicant friars. Other prominent families, long covetous of power, forced him to relinquish his authority. Thus, in 1443, Francesco had to announce his plan to spend the rest of his life in a monastic order, and the incompetent doge yielded his power to others.\n\nContemporary Venetian scholars commented on him thus: "He abandoned the handling of state affairs, never leaving the company of mendicant friars, monks, and the righteous, content with a life of less is more. When told that this would not do—that the state needed a doge capable of managing affairs—he handed over power to other families, which satisfied him greatly. His wife, relatives, and close advisors had no choice but to agree."\n\nWhat worries the Dandolo family even more is that §GFrancesco Steno Dandolo§!, already in his fifties, has no male heirs. This casts a dreadful shadow over the prospects of the Dandolo family and the entire §YVenetian Monarchy§!. If the Dandolo family's succession crisis is not properly resolved, the entire Venetian Monarchy will face irreversible catastrophe.\n\nThe situation for §YVenice§! is now precarious. The legendary §YLombard§! Duke, though advanced in years, remains ambitious and vigorous. The fate of Venice's traditional old rival, §YGenoa§!, was completely rewritten in 1437 when the ambitious mercenary captain Carlo di Savoia seized power in Genoa and stepped onto the historical stage, eager to prove his mettle and highly likely to launch a new trade war against Venice. Unfortunately, after seizing Ravenna, Venice's relations with the §YPapal State§! deteriorated sharply, and the Papacy could use its influence against Venice at any moment. The current situation is perilous. Faced with such internal troubles and external threats, can Venice overcome the crisis and be reborn? Can the Dandolo family lead Venice to create another miracle, as in 1204, achieving the most glorious victory once again in the most difficult of times?"
