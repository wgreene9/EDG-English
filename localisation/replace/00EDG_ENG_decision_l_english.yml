Now, he has betrayed the glory of the Plantagenets, groveling and surrendering to the French. We can contact those guards who remain loyal to the Plantagenet crown and, with the coordination of our navy, strike from within and without to seize the beachhead in one fell swoop."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Ever since Hugues Capet seized the French throne from the declining Carolingian dynasty of West Francia, Hugues Capet and his descendants attributed the fundamental reason for the Carolingian collapse to their failure to firmly root their family's power in the kingdom's soil. Consequently, the Capetian family enthusiastically spread its branches throughout the nation, establishing cadet branches in various regions to prevent another powerful vassal from wresting the throne away from the Capetians. However, this French practice is now bearing bitter fruit. As relationships between the main Capetian line and its cadet branches have grown strained with the dilution of blood ties, and these branches control regional power, the French king is confined to the small Île-de-France. The cadet branches have even formed a 'Public Weal' alliance to force the king into submission. We can now cooperate with these Public Weal alliances, encouraging them to openly oppose the French monarchy, which has consistently sought centralization."

At that time, our England answered the call of Louis VII of Lotharingia's allies, landing in Normandy soon after. Compounded by Arles' invasion from the south, this became known historically as the 'War of the Four Kingdoms.' However, the outcome of that war was the Dauphin Hugues' successful coronation as King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, with Jeanne d'Arc guarding his side and repelling the attacks from Lotharingians, English, and Arlesians until the war's end in 1438. Now, facing renewed conflict with France, we can apply to once again extend an invitation to our traditional ally, Lotharingia, to jointly wage war against France."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_3_decision_1_desc:0 "For a long time, the Dukes of Normandy have governed the Plantagenet holdings in Normandy from the fortress at Caen. However, in the wake of fraternal strife, insightful individuals within the Plantagenet court have come to realize that the Caen fortress may no longer be a suitable administrative center for a Norman territory loyal to the Crown. Mont-Saint-Michel, to the west of the Caen fortress, appears to be a more fitting location for a new center of governance. Therefore, England has decided to move the administrative seat of the Norman territory from the traditional Caen to the newly constructed Cotentin fortress on Mont-Saint-Michel, while the Caen fortress, a symbol of the old era, will be dismantled."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_1_decision_1_desc:0 "For a long time, the noble factions within England have been divided into two distinct groups. Although William the Conqueror led numerous Norman military groups to complete the conquest across the Channel, followed by a land distribution famously known as the 'Domesday Book,' over time, the Norman military groups that arrived on the island quickly assimilated into local customs, becoming Anglo nobility. Those who remained on the continent, however, preserved their original traditions. During the War of the Four Kingdoms between England and France, many Anglo nobles, fearing death and seeking to avoid military service, preferred to pay large sums to hire wandering mercenary bands to fight in their stead. This mercenary style of warfare gradually became a tradition among the Anglo nobility. In contrast, the Norman nobility emphasized the formation and expansion of a standing Royal Army, believing that landholders should provide military strength and that only a professional, standing army of nobles was trustworthy. Now, the King of England has brought both factions together to establish a Noble Military Council for consultation."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_2_decision_1_title:0 "@ENG Rebuild Chester Fortress"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Chester Castle is a crucial military structure within the Duchy of Lancaster. Although built upon flat farmland, its ingenious design and majestic fortifications have made it one of the foremost natural strongholds in northern England. For a significant period in the past, this castle served as a key stronghold for the Duke of Lancaster—an important leader of the anti-royalist faction within the Earls' Alliance—in his resistance against the Crown. Multiple assaults by the Royal Army on this castle ended in failure. After Edward III, 'the Wise,' executed Thomas, Duke of Lancaster, for treason and personally assumed the Duchy of Lancaster, the castle was partially dismantled. Now, facing threats from the rising Celtic powers in the north, insightful individuals have proposed that it is time to consider rebuilding this fortress."

However, it has now fallen into disrepair and offers no effective defensive capabilities. Given the increasingly strained relations between our Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, some insightful individuals at our court have proposed the necessity of rebuilding this formidable stronghold located at a key point on Hadrian's Wall. Yet, some advisors adamantly oppose this, arguing that relying on natural fortifications is ultimately meaningless, as they can be breached one day, and we must instead depend on offensive tactical doctrines."

In the past, Hadrian's Wall once provided excellent protection, leading many insightful individuals to recognize the importance of strengthening border defenses. Now, voices within our court propose that it is time to select strategic locations within the country to construct fortresses or military bases, in order to restore our traditional defensive line."

However, as the period of Welsh independence has been relatively short, we still have the opportunity to restore our rule there in a timely manner. Many insightful individuals at court point out that the fundamental reason for Wales's repeated rebellions and disloyalty to London lies in our failure to accept and embrace the Welsh people, and our lack of investment in the region. Therefore, we propose an act to implement the Welsh Ordinance, designating Wales as a special administrative region within our nation for focused development and governance."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_5_decision_2_title:0 "@ENG Crown the Heir as Prince of Wales"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Crowning the heir as Prince of Wales has long been a tradition of the Plantagenet dynasty, possibly tracing back to the time of Richard I, 'the Lionheart.' Before his accession, Richard the Lionheart was dispatched to the Welsh region to suppress rebellions and subsequently spent considerable time governing from Wales, establishing a precedent. The Plantagenet dynasty's act of crowning a child as Prince of Wales essentially signals that this child is the King's chosen successor, the Crown Prince. Additionally, early participation in the administrative affairs of Wales serves as excellent training for future ruling capabilities."
