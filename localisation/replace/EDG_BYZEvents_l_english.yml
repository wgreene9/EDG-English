EDG_BYZEvents.0.desc:0 "In 1259, Michael VIII Palaiologos, with the aid of the Republic of Genoa, seized the throne of the Empire of Nicaea, becoming co-emperor with John IV Laskaris. On July 25, 1261, he overthrew the Latin Empire, captured Constantinople, and restored the Byzantine Empire, ending the interregnum that had persisted since the Fourth Crusade. That same year, Michael deposed John IV and was crowned Byzantine Emperor, though members of the Laskaris family continued to serve the Basileus within the empire.\n\nIn 1411, military aristocrats led by Isaakios of the Angelos family staged a rebellion. Although the rebels were defeated by Manuel II Palaiologos, Isaakios led his forces across the sea westward to the Kingdom of Sicily, which was embroiled in civil war. He conquered the strife-torn kingdom and established an Orthodox Greek regime there.\n\nDuring the reign of John VIII Palaiologos, a son named Andronikos was born. Andronikos was born in the year of John VIII's accession, 1425. It is said that on the day of his birth, the Aegean Sea was unprecedentedly calm, and fishermen claimed to have heard someone calling Andronikos's name along the shore. Andronikos was a gifted prince who demonstrated remarkable talents from a young age. Fluent in multiple languages, exceptionally graceful and talented, he was also kind-hearted, modest, and courteous. He repelled Turkish incursions multiple times and earned high prestige within the Byzantine Empire's dwindling military. After becoming the first in line to the throne, John VIII once feared his heir would impatiently seize power. However, Andronikos patiently waited until John VIII's death in 1443 before being crowned Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, becoming Andronikos V.\n\nAt the time of Andronikos V's accession, Nikephoros of the Doukas family wielded significant power within the empire. Aware he might be attacked by the emperor and doubting his ability to prevail militarily, Nikephoros privately redeployed imperial forces loyal to him. Leading a mercenary force and allying with the Gothic ruler of Theodoro, he invaded the Republic of Genoa's territories along the Black Sea coast. Genoa, plagued by internal and external troubles, was unable to organize an effective resistance and thus lost its colonies near the Black Sea.\n\nIt seemed the Byzantine Empire was poised for resurgence under Andronikos V, capable of defeating the weary Serbian Empire and the fragile Edirne regime. Greeks abroad and many citizens of Constantinople spoke eagerly of this prospect. Since Andronikos V had no heirs and had been exceptionally close since childhood with Theodoros of the Laskaris family—having shared education and commanded troops together against the Turks and King Isaakios IV of Sicily, becoming comrades and confidants who built a deep friendship and solid trust—Andronikos V, in early 1444, entrusted the defense of Morea to Theodoros and appointed him as its Despot. However, after his appointment and stationing in Morea, Theodoros of the Laskaris dynasty ultimately betrayed Andronikos V. Securing support from the Doge of Venice and the Sicilian ruler Isaakios IV, he raised an army, declared independence, proclaimed himself Basileus as Theodoros III, and openly opposed Andronikos V. Upon learning of the betrayal, Andronikos V was heartbroken but powerless to reverse the situation.\n\nThus, all [Root.Monarch.GetName] now possesses is a ravaged, broken city and its dying empire."

EDG_BYZEvents.4.desc:0 "The recent history of the [Root.GetName] Empire can be summed up in one word: betrayal.\n\nDuring Andronikos's initial rise, the people of Constantinople placed their hopes for the empire's revival on the [Root.Monarch.Title], and [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself was ambitious, ready to restore the empire's past glory and rescue it from the brink of decay. Yet, in just two years, this vision was nearly shattered by an unforeseen rebellion.\n\nFor [Root.Monarch.Title] [Root.Monarch.GetName], if the 1411 rebellion led by Isaakios of the Angelos family was merely a minor episode, and the 1443 defection of the Doukas family was just a reshuffling of military and political power within the empire, then the 1444 betrayal by Theodoros was a meticulously planned operation within the empire, a complete and utter colossal deception.\n\nWhen the news of Theodoros declaring himself [Root.Monarch.Title] reached [Root.Monarch.GetName], he was utterly heartbroken. Although Constantinople is not far from Morea, threats from Bulgaria and Rumelia prevented [Root.Monarch.GetName] from lingering in the anger, sorrow, and confusion brought by the betrayal of a confidant—the empire was not yet dead. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew he faced only two outcomes: lead [Root.GetName] to revival, or be buried alongside the empire in history, serving merely as a stepping stone for others.\n\nTheodoros's rebellion completely disrupted [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s previous plans. Having completely lost territories in the Aegean region, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had to seek new opportunities. The ongoing Serbian-Bulgarian war right on his doorstep presented one such opportunity, possibly the last one.\n\nAlthough recent setbacks have led outsiders to harbor almost no expectations for [Root.GetName], this also provides [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a perfect, albeit highly risky, opportunity: a surprise attack on Bulgaria. With Bulgaria's military focus almost entirely on the war against Serbia, its southern defenses are extremely weak. Planning a surprise war to recapture [1764.GetName] is not difficult.

It wasn't until 1439, when a military coup erupted in the Republic of Genoa, leaving it unable to attend to its overseas assets, that the then Basileus John VIII seized the opportunity. He swiftly revoked almost all commercial privileges and trade posts held by the Genoese within the empire and began using these surplus funds to repair the damage to the city walls caused by Murad II's siege of [151.GetName] in June 1422.\n\nThis project was not fully completed by the time of John VIII's death.

EDG_BYZEvents.19.desc:0 "In the 8th century BCE, two core regions formed in western and eastern Georgia: Colchis and Iberia. Colchis, known in Greek legend as the 'Land of the Golden Fleece' (the Argonautica), reflecting its wealth, developed into an early alliance of trade city-states. By the 6th century BCE, with the rise of Greek colonization, the area gradually became Hellenized, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Colchis. Meanwhile, the Iberian region served as an autonomous province under the Achaemenid Empire, later seizing the opportunity to declare independence as a kingdom when Alexander defeated Persia.\n\nSubsequently, from the 3rd to the 1st centuries BCE, the Seleucid Empire, the Kingdom of Pontus, Armenia, Parthia, and Rome vied for control of the Caucasus. Ultimately, following Pompey the Great's defeat of King Mithridates VI of Pontus, Colchis was incorporated as a Roman province, while Iberia and Albania (modern-day Azerbaijan) were established as client buffer states to contain the Iranian powers to the east.\n\nFrom the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the declining Roman Empire gradually relinquished authority in the Caucasus. Georgia oscillated between Roman and Iranian allegiances. In the 6th century, the Eastern Empire and Sassanid Persia clashed in the Lazic War over the Southern Caucasus, with Georgians siding with the Sassanids. In 625, Heraclius launched a counteroffensive, briefly restoring control over Georgia and Armenia, but by then the weakened Roman power could not sustain its hold. With the Arab Caliphate's conquest of the Sassanid dynasty and its occupation of the Caucasus, Roman rule over the region came to an end.\n\nIn the following centuries, Georgia managed to gain independence and established a unified Georgian monarchy by the late 10th century, resuming ties with the Eastern Empire. However, this period of stability was short-lived. From the 13th to the mid-15th century, Georgia endured successive invasions by Turks, Mongols, Tatars, and Turkmens, sharing the Eastern Empire's plight as a Christian 'enclave' by the Black Sea. The recent Bagrationi succession crisis further plunged the region into fraternal strife and fragmentation, leaving it vulnerable to Muslim domination.\n\nFortunately, subsequent events are well known—the empire aided the Bagrationi family in quelling internal strife, restoring control over Georgia and the Caucasus, and now plans to establish a permanent military Theme here. This will serve to defend against steppe raiders and the ancient Persian foe, securing the eastern wall of the Mediterranean.

EDG_BYZEvents.20.desc:0 "In ancient times, Crimea was known as 'Chersonesus Taurica,' a name derived from the Tauri people, descendants of the Indo-European nomadic Cimmerians. Many Greek colonists settled in the Taurica region, with the most prominent settlement being Chersonesos, located in what is today the outskirts of Sevastopol, Crimea's most vital port.\n\nChersonesos and the surrounding coastal areas long served as key outposts for Greek colonization. Even after the periods of Alexander's empire and Hellenization, the region remained under the control of the Hellenized Bosporan Kingdom.\n\nIn 114 BCE, the Bosporan Kingdom accepted the overlordship of the more powerful Pontic King Mithridates VI, another Hellenized kingdom along the Black Sea coast, to avoid raids by Scythian tribes. About half a century later, the Roman general Pompey defeated Mithridates, and for nearly five subsequent centuries, the area remained under Roman suzerainty. Beginning in the 1st century BCE, Rome established rule over the Crimean peninsula, initially focusing on eastern Crimea (the Bosporan Kingdom) and the western Greek colonial city of Chersonesos, while the northern part of the peninsula remained under Scythian influence. In 16 BCE, the Bosporan Kingdom became a Roman client state. Under imperial rule, the Taurican interior was nominally controlled, with Roman activity largely confined to the coasts.\n\nRome's primary colony was Charax, a fortress likely constructed around 60-65 AD, while the main base for the Roman navy was at Chersonesos. Upon their arrival in Taurica, the Romans established a fortress and a temple to Jupiter Dolichenus on the shores of Balaklava Bay, later known as the Sanctuary of Limen.\n\nHowever, the Taurica region was briefly occupied by the Goths in 250 AD. The last Bosporan King under Roman suzerainty in Taurica was Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis VI, who died in 342 AD. Rhescuporis likely minted coins until around 341 AD, indicating some degree of political control over the remnants of the kingdom at that point. In 375 or 376 AD, with the invasion of the Huns, the last vestiges of the Bosporan Kingdom were finally swept away.\n\nIn the following centuries, imperial control over the region diminished and waned in interest. One consequence of the Fourth Crusade was the secession of Theodoro from the empire, nominally ruled by the Komnenos dynasty, and the arrival of the Afsharids led to Theodoro's renewed independence.\n\nSubsequent events are well known—the empire has regained control of the Crimean region and now plans to establish a permanent military Theme here to secure the gateway to Black Sea trade. Under our rule, this land is destined to grow ever more prosperous and strong."

Yet, in their cups, they forgot the perilous world beyond. They were wrong, and gravely so.\n\nThe Afshars, driven out by the Ottoman Empire, finally set their sights on the end of their journey: Trebizond. They swiftly besieged the outwardly formidable yet hollow city. Sustained assaults shattered the hopes of the Greeks within. Dark clouds gathered in the north, foretelling a storm at sea. But the Komnenian emperor and his nobles had long since packed their gold, silver, and valuables, abandoning the city and its people aboard warships. With the emperor's flight, the defenders' will broke, and they surrendered the city to the Afshars.\n\nMany noble ships found harbor in Imereti, Theodoro, or Constantinople. Yet numerous vessels, including that of the panic-stricken Komnenian emperor laden with treasures amassed by generations of emperors, vanished from historical record.\n\nPerhaps Poseidon, god of the sea, dragged the faithless monarch into the rolling waves of the Black Sea.

EDG_BYZEvents.23.name:0 "The Pentarchy and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople"
EDG_BYZEvents.23.desc:0 "The Pentarchy is a term in Christian history, originating from the ideal of unifying the entire territory of the Roman Empire under a single Christendom by the leaders of the early Church. These regions were divided into five bishoprics, each administered by a Patriarch. These five churches were located in Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.\n\nThe concept of unifying universal and sole governance within the hands of Christendom was closely linked to the structure of Roman imperial rule. However, due to regional political realities and ecclesiastical power dynamics, the division into five patriarchates emerged. These five sees held greater authority than other bishoprics because of their political and ecclesiastical importance; they were all situated in significant cities and regions of the empire and were major centers of the Church. Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch played crucial roles in the early development of the Church. Constantinople became the imperial capital in the 4th century, the 'New Rome,' and after the Sixth Ecumenical Council, held equal status with the Holy See of Rome. Jerusalem, of great importance in the Apostolic era, thus received a ceremonial ranking.\n\nWhen Emperor Constantine established Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD, the bishop of this city naturally became the second-ranking figure within Christendom, subordinate only to the bishop of the 'Old' Rome, the Pope. Shortly after the capital's relocation, the bishop was elevated to Archbishop.\n\nFor many centuries, the Popes opposed the Bishop of Constantinople attaining such a status, as it would alter the established hierarchy of Christendom. However, at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, it was decreed: 'The Bishop of Constantinople shall have the prerogative of honor after the Bishop of Rome, because Constantinople is New Rome.'\n\nPope Damasus I and Pope Gregory I refused to recognize this decree—an unusual act that was questioned and condemned, as ecumenical councils were supposed to be binding on the entire Christian world. Despite such sharp opposition, the status of the Bishop of Constantinople grew increasingly prominent under the patronage of the Byzantine Emperors.\n\nThe Council of Chalcedon in 451 formally established the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople (encompassing Asia Minor and Thrace) and affirmed Constantinople's position in the Church as second only to Rome. Pope Leo I refused to accept this canon, denouncing it as illegal and invalid because the decision was made in the absence of papal legates.\n\nSince the beginning of the Middle Ages, the affairs of the Patriarch were largely controlled by the Basileus, often manipulated for imperial purposes. As the empire's strength was insufficient to support the Patriarch fully exercising his religious functions, successive Basileis made a series of compromises with the Catholic Church to secure more support, leading to the suppression of Orthodox religious functions during this period. With the revocation of the Church Union policy and a shift from compromise to confrontation, the authority of the Orthodox Church, supported once again by the Basileus, began actively engaging in various religious matters."

EDG_BYZEvents.24.desc:0 "The Patriarch of Antioch, fully titled the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, denotes the episcopal see centered in Antioch, overseeing the Christian flock across all Eastern nations. Its actual jurisdiction historically encompassed most of the Asian territories of the Roman Empire. It is one of the four most ancient Orthodox Churches, and its leader holds the title of Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. By historical honor, the Patriarch of Antioch ranks third among the leaders of the fifteen autocephalous Orthodox Churches, following the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria.\n\nThe See of Antioch is one of the oldest Christian dioceses. According to tradition, the cathedral in Antioch was founded by the Apostle Peter. As recorded in the New Testament's Acts of the Apostles, it was in the church of Antioch that Peter first used the term 'Christian' to refer to the followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Bishop of Antioch was elevated to the rank of Patriarch, and his jurisdiction became known as the Patriarchate of Antioch. Prior to the Arab conquests, the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Antioch included Syria, Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia.\n\n[2313.GetName] was once the largest city of the Roman Empire in Syria, serving as the capital of the province of Syria and later of the Diocese of the East. It was one of the most vital centers for the propagation of early Christianity and stood as the most important academic base for Eastern Christianity. After the massacre of the city by Baibars on May 18, 1268, [2313.GetName] never fully recovered. With the empire's reconquest of this crucial religious territory, the foremost task is to rebuild its Patriarchate and restore its functions."

EDG_BYZEvents.25.desc:0 "The Patriarch of Jerusalem, fully titled the Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and All Palestine, is the leader of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, one of the fifteen autocephalous Orthodox Churches. By historical honor, the Patriarch of Jerusalem ranks fourth among all Orthodox leaders, following the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch.\n\nPrior to 451, Jerusalem was merely a bishopric. It was elevated to the status of a Patriarchate at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. According to tradition, James, the brother of Jesus Christ, was the first bishop of Jerusalem (62 AD).\n\nAfter the Arab conquest, Muslim rulers recognized Jerusalem's status as a Christian see and acknowledged its Patriarch (after the East-West Schism, conventionally translated as Patriarch) as its leader. In 1099, the Crusaders who captured Jerusalem exiled the Orthodox Patriarch and installed a Latin Patriarch in an attempt to Latinize (or Catholicize) the Jerusalemite see. Until 1187, the Patriarch of Jerusalem resided in exile in Constantinople.\n\nNow that the empire has reclaimed this holy city, it is time for the Patriarchate to resume its former religious functions."

EDG_BYZEvents.26.desc:0 "The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the five ancient Patriarchates of Christianity, ranking after the Patriarchs of the West and Constantinople, and before the Patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem.\n\nThe Church of Alexandria is an autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church, originally one of the major centers of ancient Christianity. Tradition holds that Saint Mark founded the episcopal see there. Its Patriarch originally governed the Eastern Orthodox churches in eastern Africa. During the 5th-century Christological controversies concerning the divine and human natures of Christ, the majority of its adherents rejected the Christological doctrine defined by the Council of Chalcedon, splitting from the Orthodox Church to become Miaphysites; as their liturgy uses Coptic, they are also known as the Coptic Church. Only those who accepted the Chalcedonian Creed remained part of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, with followers mainly residing in Africa. After the 7th century, some adherents converted to Islam, and with the empire's diminishing influence in the region, the number of Orthodox Christians gradually declined.\n\nWith the empire's restoration of rule over this city, the influence of the Orthodox Church is poised to regain its prominence in the future."

EDG_BYZEvents.27.desc:0 "Long before the Roman Empire moved its capital to Constantinople in 330 AD, Christianity had been established as the state religion. As early as the 1st century in the classical era, the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) was established in the city of Rome. Due to its location at the heart of the empire, the Roman bishop's status had always been higher than that of bishops elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the Pentarchy system established by Justinian, the Patriarchate of Rome's jurisdiction was not limited to Italy but also included the Greek peninsula. The other four patriarchates were: Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.\n\nThe five patriarchates contended for primacy within Christianity, with the rivalry between Rome and Constantinople—the empire's old and new capitals—being particularly intense. After the Sixth Ecumenical Council, the status of the Patriarch of Constantinople was affirmed as equal to that of the Roman Patriarch, sowing the seeds of the growing rift between Eastern and Western churches. As the Lombards steadily encroached upon Italy, Byzantium maintained ties with the Roman Church through the Exarchate of Ravenna, but the rift between them grew increasingly evident. With the outbreak of the 'Iconoclast Controversy' in the East, the conflict between the Papacy and the Byzantine Emperor became an open fact.\n\nAs Lombard infiltration deepened, Rome and its surrounding territories (then the Duchy of Rome, loyal to the Byzantine Empire) gradually became separated from other imperial lands. By 751, the Lombards had largely eradicated Byzantine power in the Italian peninsula. Pope Stephen II was forced to seek help from the Frankish ruler Pippin the Short of the Carolingian dynasty, crowning him 'Patrician of the Romans.' The latter led his army into Italy in 754.\n\nSoon after, Frankish forces defeated the Lombard Kingdom, and Pippin compelled the Lombards to surrender Ravenna, which they had seized only three years earlier, to the Pope. In 756, with the capture of the Lombard king, the Franks transferred most of central and northern Italy to the Roman Pope, establishing the Papal States as a theocratic entity. From then on, the empire could no longer freely intervene in Roman Church affairs, and its standing within Christianity was significantly weakened.\n\nThereafter, imperial influence over the Papacy steadily declined, while Western European powers, particularly the Franks, exerted a more profound impact on Rome. During Charlemagne's reign, Pope Leo III crowned him 'Emperor of the Romans' on Christmas Day, 800, establishing the Frankish Empire as the legal successor to the Western Roman Empire and the protector of Christianity, further diminishing imperial authority.\n\nAfter the Great Schism of 1054, it became clear that peaceful means could not resolve the division. Only by regaining control of the Roman Papacy could this schism be conclusively ended. And now is the most opportune moment."
