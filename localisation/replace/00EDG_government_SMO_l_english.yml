EDG_Peasant_regime_Political_system_1_desc:0 "The Military-Administrative Committee was established during the Republic's most perilous hour. To mobilize all domestic forces to the greatest extent, the committee was granted immense authority."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Political_system_2_desc:0 "The full name of the Assembly is the Republic's Congress of Peasants and Artisans. Initially, in theory, only peasants and artisans could hold seats, but it later allowed representatives from other social classes. The Assembly is the highest national organ, possessing all powers defined by law."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Political_system_3_desc:0 "The Consultative Council denies the distinctions between peasants, artisans, merchants, clergy, and bureaucrats. It holds that all people within society should be able to join the center of political power and that all issues can be resolved through consultation and voting rather than violent struggle and dictatorship."
EDG_Peasant_regime_economic_system_1_desc:0 "The village communes in the Rus' region have long maintained a tradition of autonomy. Within each commune, the self-sufficient yeoman farmers are independent of each other."
EDG_Peasant_regime_economic_system_2_desc:0 "Within the collective farms, households labor together. Income is distributed according to the quantity of labor contributed after necessary deductions. Member households may retain small tools, a certain number of livestock and poultry, manage allotted homestead plots, and engage in household sideline production as supplemental income."
EDG_Peasant_regime_economic_system_3_desc:0 "The Treasury Ministry excels at expanding state tax revenues and organizing government departments for economic management."
EDG_Peasant_regime_economic_system_4_desc:0 "The General Revenue Office is dedicated to promoting advanced production technologies and economic planning, improving domestic infrastructure construction, and developing production."
EDG_Peasant_regime_economic_system_5_desc:0 "The Economic Council is dominated by innovative financial talents and merchants capable of expanding domestic and international trade and other financial activities."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Military_organizations_1_desc:0 "We primarily rely on the state's coercive apparatus to conscript armies, which carries certain feudal characteristics."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Military_organizations_2_desc:0 "Our army is composed of patriotic and courageous citizens. The military denies hierarchies; officers and common soldiers are entirely equal. All soldiers can equally and reasonably obtain spoils from military operations."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Military_organizations_3_desc:0 "An army formed by civilians is not reliable; only a professional army can protect the homeland."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Military_organizations_4_desc:0 "Maxim is a national hero of the Republic of Roxia. He led the Republic's warriors valiantly in wars of liberation and was once bestowed the title of Marshal. Maxim also implemented a series of military reforms that eradicated corruption within the army, established the principle of equal distribution, and greatly enhanced the Republic's military zeal and strength."

EDG_Peasant_regime_Religious_principles_1_desc:0 "The religious principles we uphold contain strong traditionalism, requiring people to be content with their lot and abide by the rules."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Religious_principles_2_desc:0 "Theologian Daniel believed that we should strengthen state management of the church, actively proselytize, and expand the influence of the state religion."
EDG_Peasant_regime_Religious_principles_3_desc:0 "Our religion teaches us to expand our liberation war and free all oppressed compatriots."
EDG_Peasant_regime_National_virtue_1_desc:0 "Tradition is an iron law. Respecting tradition is a virtue that every citizen must practice. Hierarchies and injustices in life are universal and reasonable."
EDG_Peasant_regime_National_virtue_2_desc:0 "Hierarchy and injustice must be negated. The interests of the collective are above all else, which requires the sacrifice of certain individual interests."
EDG_Peasant_regime_National_virtue_3_desc:0 "True equality is the ideal we revere. Even the state and the collective must respect the individual and uphold equality. Paternalism and traditional authority are mere empty talk in the face of equality."
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_1_desc:0 "Our tradition proves that it is correct to ensure the supreme ruler of the state holds absolute power. Without the coercive power of the state apparatus, the individual cannot stand."
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_2_desc:0 "Power requires certain checks. Unrestrained power can easily lead to tyranny and oppression."
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_3_desc:0 "Public authority needs a well-established balance of powers to prevent the emergence of absolute power and eliminate tyranny and oppression."
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_4_desc:0 "We have a government structure established following democratic and egalitarian principles. A clean and transparent government brings higher administrative efficiency."

EDG_Peasant_regime_National_virtue_4:0 "Authoritarianism"
EDG_Peasant_regime_National_virtue_4_desc:0 "Only the most exceptional leader is qualified to issue commands. We must surrender all power to our leader, who must be an autocrat capable of steering national politics—this is the power granted to him by God."
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_5:0 "Absolutism"
EDG_Peasant_regime_public_rights_5_desc:0 "Our state operates on absolutism. The People's Assembly is merely a rubber stamp; yeomen and artisans retain only nominal political rights. Yet anyone can see they are no different from debt slaves."

EDG_ROS_Citizen_Government_2:0 "Roxian Autocratic Government"
EDG_ROS_Citizen_Government_2_desc:0 "After experiencing a great catastrophe, we have finally realized that only autocratic rule can save Roxia. Today, the People's Assembly is merely a rubber stamp. Yeomen and artisans retain only nominal political rights, but anyone can see they are no different from debt slaves."
