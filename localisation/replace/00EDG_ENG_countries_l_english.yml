sick_and_hurt_land_desc:0 "The establishment of the Royal Army Sick and Hurt Board began with a royal military council, where the personal account of a disabled veteran brought the king and the entire noble military council to focus on the issue of army casualties and injuries. The organization's responsibility is to safeguard the welfare of serving soldiers, introducing a series of reforms aimed at improving the army's medical and healthcare system. This may be the world's earliest systematic institution dedicated to the care and rescue of injured and disabled soldiers."

EDG_string_start_ENG:0 "§YHistorical Background§!\n\nEngland in Entrance to the Desolate Ground embarked on a markedly different path following the death of the notorious 'Lackland' John. Evidently, the damage inflicted by John upon England did not cease with his ascent to heaven. The Magna Carta became a talisman for English nobles, and victory in the First Barons' War further cemented these privileges. Among the territories lost by 'Lackland' John, none was more famous than the island of Ireland. After the death of Richard 'the Lionheart,' his nephew Arthur inherited the title of Lord of Ireland. However, Arthur was murdered by John in 1203, and the local magnates, discontent with John's rule, eventually rose in rebellion in 1204, causing the Plantagenets to lose control of Ireland entirely.\n\n§YEngland during the Reign of Henry III, 'Defender of Normandy'§!\n\nIn 1216 AD, King John died amidst shock and rebellion, and his son Henry III was crowned. However, the intervening French Dauphin Louis, allied with rebellious barons, defeated the royal army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings, where conflict had unfolded a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding local noble power. In the early years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a pawn manipulated by the earls, who enjoyed far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts. Some even secretly conspired to support the king's cousin, Eleanor of Brittany, for the throne. Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, reached a superficial reconciliation with the king, but underlying tensions persisted, erupting completely in 1258.\n\nA year earlier, in 1257, Henry III led the royal guard to victory at Rouen, defeating France and reclaiming control of Normandy. Henry III then demanded expansion of the royal standing army, requiring additional funding and higher feudal taxes. That spring, when Henry III sought parliamentary grants to enlarge the army, English nobles led by the Earl of Norfolk, Earl of Gloucester, and Earl of Leicester demanded broader devolution of power in exchange for the funds. The conflict between king and earls exploded, triggering the Third Barons' War.\n\nThe Third Barons' War ended with the Earl of Leicester's victory at the Battle of Lewes and his subsequent march into London. Like his father, Henry III was defeated by angry lords. The Earls of Leicester and Norfolk were both elevated to dukes. Meanwhile, the Scottish noble Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, seized lands around his father's barony in Northumberland, declaring, 'In Scotland, I am Earl of Angus; in England, Earl of Northumberland.' Defeated in the baronial war, Henry III had limited reach over Northumberland and tacitly accepted its semi-independent status. In 1272, Henry III, 'Defender of Normandy,' died at Westminster, and his eldest son, the valiant Edward I, 'Hammer of the Welsh,' took up the king's scepter.\n\n§YEngland during the Reign of Edward I, 'Hammer of the Welsh'§!\n\nWhile England underwent dramatic upheavals, with struggles between king and earls unceasing, the northern Scottish situation was subtly changing. Despite a failed claim to the throne, Edward I was not content to stand idly by. In the summer of 1292, Edward I invaded Scotland. The Scots allied with France, forcing Edward I into a two-front war. Though England achieved tactical victories, the advance stalled. Increasing taxes on wool and wine made the king increasingly unpopular. The war ended with England's withdrawal.\n\nAlthough Edward I's conquest of Scotland failed, the Principality of Wales, once part of the Celtic camp and long historically allied with Scotland, suffered devastating blows during Edward I's northern campaigns. Edward I repeatedly defeated Welsh main forces in the Welsh mountains, even uprooting several guerrilla groups formed by Welsh hillmen. His unpredictable, swift, and fierce command art amazed and terrified the Welsh, earning him the epithet 'Hammer of the Welsh'.\n\nIn 1307, Edward I, leader of the Ninth Crusade and brilliant military commander, 'Hammer of the Welsh,' died, and Edward II succeeded.\n\n§YEngland during the Reign of Edward II, 'the Ineffectual'§!\n\nEdward II's reign could hardly be described as mediocre. Ever-expanding noble power increasingly confined royal authority to southeastern England, effectively making him the Earl of London. His favorite, the Earl of Cornwall, was exiled twice under pressure from nobles led by the king's relative, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Defeat in the Northumberland Border War and the Great Famine of 1315-1317 dealt heavy blows to the troubled kingdom. After the king's final attempt to break free from unruly nobles inevitably failed, and his last favorite, the Earl of Winchester, was defeated and executed, Edward II's reign ended.\n\n§YEngland during the Reign of Edward III, 'the Astute'§!\n\nAfter Edward II's death, his son Edward III, 'the Astute,' inherited the heavy crown, but England's true rulers were Queen Dowager Isabella of France (the main force behind her husband's deposition) and her lover Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, along with their Council of Earls.\n\nEdward III was far more capable than his ineffectual father, but his situation was even more precarious. Fortunately, Edward III encountered favorable circumstances. The Great Famine not only severely struck England but also dealt a crippling blow to the proud earls, whose manorial economies suffered far greater losses than the crown. Moreover, the Council of Earls was not monolithic. Edward III expertly concealed his personal sentiments, even cooperating with Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, to rapidly revitalize royal authority, despite the moral compromise.\n\nPatiently waiting, opportunity soon arrived. The king's relative, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, as former regent and key figure in Edward II's deposition, failed to monopolize power within the Council of Earls, instead being checked by Roger, Earl of March. The two soon turned against each other. Edward III exploited their conflict, ultimately using Thomas's open rebellion as a pretext to reclaim the Lancaster earldom. Though compromise prevented direct royal annexation, Edward III persuaded the Council of Earls to allow him to personally assume the title of Earl of Lancaster.\n\n§YRecent History§!\n\nAs time passed, the throne eventually reached the current king, Richard VI. Richard cannot be called a highly talented monarch, but he is at least a competent steward. Before his accession, his father Richard V had just lost control over the Welsh region, which had achieved de facto independence and established a Welsh principality.\n\nMeanwhile, Lollardy was spreading fervently across English soil. In the early 14th century, English theologian John Wycliffe launched fierce attacks against the Roman Catholic Church, and his followers were scornfully termed 'Lollards,' or heretics. The first Lollards centered on Wycliffe's colleagues at Oxford University, led by Nicholas of Hereford. In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury pressured some Oxford Lollards to recant, but the movement continued to expand. A Lollard uprising in 1414 was quickly defeated by the English king, Richard V, father of Richard VI, and brutally suppressed. However, due to the overall decline and turmoil within the Catholic world, this uprising did not mark the end of Lollardy's open political influence. Increasing numbers of commoners and preachers began openly or secretly embracing Lollardy, gradually slipping beyond English rulers' control.\n\nBy 1444, large numbers in southern England had converted to Lollardy, and the East Anglia region had established its own Lollard church, breaking away from Roman ecclesiastical control. The ruler of East Anglia also embraced Lollard doctrine, establishing a Lollard Council subordinate to the duke to manage local Lollard believers and provide support for the ruler.\n\nSimilarly striking heavy blows to England were the independence of the Duke of York and the loss of control over several commercial free cities in the Mercia region. Under these blows, Richard V soon passed away, leaving the mess to the young, barely twenty-year-old Richard VI.\n\nFortunately, Richard VI quickly familiarized himself with governance and dispatched his brother, widely regarded as clever and sharp-minded, John of Plantagenet, to Normandy to manage the English king's estates in northern France, a role he has held to this day. Before 1444, John was Richard's heir and remained loyal, managing the Norman territories efficiently and serving his brother diligently in two Anglo-French Wars (namely, the Second Albigensian Crusade and the Four Kingdoms' War). However, in 1444, Richard fathered a daughter, Margaret, and designated her as his heir, causing John to miss the English throne, breeding resentment. Whether conspiracies will unfold remains unknown."
