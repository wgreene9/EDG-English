EDG_flavor_HZB_mission.0.title:0 "The Hazaraspid Clan"
EDG_flavor_HZB_mission.0.desc:0 "The Hazaraspid dynasty was established by Kurds and once ruled the Lorestan region as the Ilkhanate's governor of Lorestan. The Hazaraspid rulers adopted the title 'Thousand Horses' and gradually expanded their power during the Ilkhanate period. When the great khans forgot their tradition of galloping on horseback and became intoxicated with the comforts of Soltaniyeh, only those who held the reins could remain unscathed in the empire's total collapse of 1335. Several successors warmed the throne of the Ilkhanate's khan only briefly before passing it on. Of course, compared to the Chobanids of the Tayichi'ud tribe controlling the northwest and the Jalayirids holding the fertile lands, the Hazaraspids, nestled in the mountains, clearly had little power to contend with them.\n\nHowever, the Hazaraspids' keen sense of smell discovered a means to enhance their own legitimacy. After the Golden Horde's army breached the city of Tabriz, the so-called Ilkhanate monarch, the obscure Noshiwan, disappeared amidst the flames of war. The Hazaraspids secretly welcomed the deposed former great khan, Sati Beg Khanum, to ascend the throne once more. Regarding the necessity of installing a female monarch, these Kurds engaged in intense internal debate, but to boost legitimacy, a group of Kurds disguised as merchants ultimately chose to smuggle this daughter of Öljaitü out of the city hidden within a rolled Persian carpet. Sati Beg entered into her fourth matrimonial alliance following marriages to Amir Choban, Arpa Ke'un, and Sulayman Khan. As various claimants either met untimely deaths or succumbed to illness, by 1330, Khanum Sati Beg became the sole legitimate heir, and various factions reluctantly acknowledged the legitimacy of this puppet female khan. In 1345, Khan Sati Beg passed away, and her son Surgan and his descendants inherited the puppet khanate to this day. As for Lorestan, the cradle of the Hazaraspid clan's rise, after the Hazaraspid ruler was elevated to the rank of Pillar of State, it was bestowed upon their trusted confidants—a family utterly subservient to the Hazaraspid rulers—turning Lorestan into a highly autonomous yet loyally obedient fiefdom under central authority.\n\nAlthough the Hazaraspid rulers effectively control the highest power of the Ilkhanate under the title 'Pillar of State,' they are not the nominal legitimate rulers of the Ilkhanate. The legitimacy of successive 'Pillars of State' has been constantly questioned, and waves of opposition against the Hazaraspid clan leaders have never ceased. We must strive to consolidate our rule."
