EDG_VEN_mission_1_1_title:0 "Imperial Foreign Policy"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Venice is the sole North Italian nation isolated outside the Holy Roman Empire, surrounded on all sides by Imperial territory. Since Duke Filippo of Lombardy was granted the title of Viceroy of Italy by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, our position in Northern Italy has become increasingly difficult. We must carefully consider our relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor and make the correct choice between cooperating with or opposing him."
EDG_VEN_mission_1_2_title:0 "Control the Passes"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The Bishopric of Trent holds a critically important geographical position, situated precisely at the Alpine passes, guarding the vital routes from southern Germany into the Venetian heartland. Furthermore, a significant number of Venetians have long resided and lived in this area, and local culture and customs have become Venetianized. We have both the need and the justification to bring the Bishopric of Trent under our control."
EDG_VEN_mission_1_3_title:0 "Into Mountains and Forests" # Advance into Mountains and Forests
EDG_VEN_mission_1_3_desc:0 "With the Bishopric of Trent under our control, we can now cross the Alpine passes and further expand our influence deeper into the Holy Roman Empire. Before us lie the formidable mountains once belonging to the County of Tyrol—the Tyrolean Alps—and the forested lands inhabited by Slovenians."
EDG_VEN_mission_1_4_title:0 "Protect Slovenia"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_4_desc:0 "Slovenians are traditionally considered a South Slavic people and have long been denied fair and just treatment within the Holy Roman Empire. The Duchy of Carinthia, which once ruled these Slovenian-inhabited lands, also subjected them to oppressive rule. Now that this region is under our control, we Venetians, with our broad-mindedness and inclusivity, aspire to become the protectors of the Slovenians, offering them a peaceful and prosperous homeland."
EDG_VEN_mission_1_5_title:0 "Cross the Adige River"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_5_desc:0 "The Adige River, the second largest river in Northern Italy after the Po, has long served as the natural boundary separating us from the traditional Duchy of Austria. In the past, we always watched the enemies across the Adige with fear and vigilance, for they were far stronger than us. Now, it is time to reverse this situation. Let us cross the Adige River and bring the Austrians under the dominion of our great Venice!"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_6_title:0 "Subjugate Austria"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_6_desc:0 "The bloody Venetian-Austrian War has finally concluded. After arduous and fierce battles, the Venetians have ultimately achieved victory. Our most esteemed Venetian Prince proudly led his troops into Vienna, the former seat of Austrian power and spiritual symbol. However, as the saying goes, conquering is easy but governing is hard. Now, an even more challenging problem lies before us: we must manage the Austrians effectively."
 
EDG_VEN_mission_2_2_title:0 "Control Ragusa"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Ragusa is a crucial port on the Dalmatian coast, arguably the most important trading city on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Most merchant ships sailing the Adriatic call here for trade, making it vital for Venetian trade routes. However, Ragusan merchants are notoriously proud; past Venetian merchant communities struggled to make them submit. Now is the time to resolve this issue."
EDG_VEN_mission_2_3_title:0 "Dalmatian Corridor"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_3_desc:0 "The Dalmatian Corridor refers to the long, narrow coastal strip on the western side of the Balkan Peninsula, named after the former Roman province of Dalmatia, the birthplace of Roman Emperor Diocletian. During the Fourth Crusade, Enrico Dandolo guided the crusaders to capture Zara, a major city in Dalmatia, establishing initial control over the corridor. Now we must continue to secure this passage, connecting our homeland to our vast overseas territories."
EDG_VEN_mission_2_4_title:0 "Guardians of Tyrol"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Beyond the Bishopric of Trent, across the Alps, lie the territories once belonging to the County of Tyrol in the Holy Roman Empire—the modern Tyrolean Alps. The County of Tyrol is now but dust. The County of Württemberg and the Duchy of Carinthia divided its former lands, which are now conquered by Venice. We will fully utilize the Tyrolean Alps' geographical advantages to establish firm rule over this region."
EDG_VEN_mission_2_5_title:0 "Frankokratia"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_5_desc:0 "Constantinople, the former capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, hailed as the 'City of the World's Desire' and 'Queen of Cities,' now falls under Venetian control. For a long time, Venetians have also named this city Frankokratia, meaning 'the City under Frankish Rule.' This name originates from the Latin state established here by the Franks after the Fourth Crusade. The term 'Franks' derives from the Orthodox Greeks' name for the Western French and Italians from territories once part of the Frankish Empire—a political entity that controlled most regions after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. This name can also be understood as 'the City under Venetian Rule.'"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_6_title:0 "City of the World's Desire"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_6_desc:0 "During the Eastern Roman Empire's rule, Constantinople, the imperial capital—today's Frankokratia—was renowned as the 'City of the World's Desire,' signifying its magnificent scale and grandeur. Now that Venetians have taken over this city, we must continue to expand and invest in it, ensuring the 'City of the World's Desire' loses none of its luster."
 
EDG_VEN_mission_3_1_title:0 "Balkan Foreign Policy"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_1_desc:0 "While Venice was in gradual decline, the once-great Serbia, which had defeated the rising Ottoman dynasty, was also fading. Bulgarians raised the banner of rebellion against Serbian tyranny, and the Balkan powder keg was thrown into turmoil once more. Venice must carefully choose its stance, intervene in the Balkan situation at the opportune moment, and reap benefits from the Serbo-Bulgarian war to secure maximum gains for itself."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_2_title:0 "A Political Marriage"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The Venetian Monarchy faces its most perilous moment in over two centuries—a succession crisis, as Francesco Steno Dandolo has no male heirs. Fortunately, however, the main line of the House of Dandolo still has a female descendant. The late son of a former Venetian Doge left behind an orphaned daughter who has already demonstrated extraordinary talent and is held in high hopes within the Dandolo family. Many family elders have planned to place this young woman on the throne of the Venetian Monarchy. The only thing lacking is a powerful husband to serve as her support and guarantee of strength, silencing any opposition. At this moment, a suitable candidate for marriage has come into the view of the Dandolo elders: a young Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, who is of appropriate age and, on the brink of national collapse, is desperately seeking foreign protectors.\n\n§GNote: This will be one of your methods to resolve the Dandolo family's succession crisis.§!"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_3_title:0 "Reclaim the Aegean"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_3_desc:0 "The Aegean Sea, the romantic Aegean, was once an inseparable part of both the Venetian Monarchy and the Byzantine Empire. After the victory of the Fourth Crusade, Venetians gained control over the western part of Greece, Corfu, the Ionian Islands, a series of bases and islands in the Aegean Sea, and the strategically vital Gallipoli peninsula and the Dardanelles. However, with Venice's decline, many of these territories were permanently lost. Now is the time to reclaim these beautiful pearls."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_4_title:0 "The Liberation of Greece"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_4_desc:0 "Over the past fifty or sixty years, no words can fully describe the suffering endured by the Greeks. Greeks west of the Aegean were partly under the oppressive rule of the Serbian Empire, with only the Despotates of Arta and Morea maintaining independence. Greeks east of the Aegean faced an even more tragic struggle for survival against the Turks. Now is the time to end all of this. The Venetian Monarchy can solemnly declare: Greece is liberated! The Greeks have welcomed their most noble savior and protector—Venice!"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_5_title:0 "Annex Cyprus"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_5_desc:0 "The island of Cyprus, isolated in the Eastern Mediterranean, has always been a brilliant pearl of the region. It was once Byzantine territory, experiencing various vicissitudes—raided by Arabs, occupied by the English, ruled by the Knights Templar, transferred to the French and the King of Jerusalem, and finally becoming the independent Kingdom of Cyprus. Now, Venice brings the history of this laughable one-province kingdom to an end, but Venice will continue to write Cyprus's glorious future."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_6_title:0 "Triangular Trade" # Venetian Triangular Trade
EDG_VEN_mission_3_6_desc:0 "After gaining control over the three major Eastern Mediterranean trading hubs—Constantinople, Aleppo, and Alexandria—Venice created a unique triangular trade characteristic of Venice. Alexandria is a rare source of spices, Aleppo is a rare source of silk—both are precious commodities scarce throughout Europe. Conversely, the Middle East and North Africa greatly desire Venetian glass. The exchange of these three products has led to unprecedented prosperity in Venetian trade."
 
EDG_VEN_mission_4_2_title:0 "Cooperate with Skanderbeg"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_2_desc:0 "We must admit that the small mountainous nation of Albania has given birth to an exceptionally brilliant leader, Skanderbeg. He possesses not only outstanding military prowess but also a genius for diplomacy, adept at balancing between multiple powers. Perhaps we too can deepen our cooperation with Skanderbeg, making this 'Eagle of the Mountains' work for us."
EDG_VEN_mission_4_3_title:0 "Autonomy for the Alessians" # Grant Autonomy to the Lezhë People
EDG_VEN_mission_4_3_desc:0 "We have offered Skanderbeg terms too favorable to refuse. We will grant the people of Lezhë significant autonomy, allowing them to join our Venetian Monarchy as an autonomous vassal state under the leadership of the Dandolo family."
EDG_VEN_mission_4_4_title:0 "Friends Forever"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_4_desc:0 "The people of Lezhë have proven their loyalty and reliability through their actions. Even the typically calculating Venetians cannot help but be impressed by the Lezhë people's commitment to contracts and their admirable will. As Albania develops under Venetian rule, mutual recognition between the two peoples continues to grow. The Eagle of the Mountains will be our friend forever. Albanians from the mountains will form various mercenary companies and join our armies."
EDG_VEN_mission_4_5_title:0 "South Slavic Puppet"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_5_desc:0 "When we previously intervened in the Balkan situation, we may have chosen a South Slavic ally. Perhaps we made the right choice, or perhaps we made the wrong one—history offers no 'what-ifs,' and we cannot know. Now, our dominance in the Balkan Peninsula and the entire Near East is growing unparalleled. One thing is certain: we do not need a South Slavic ally standing as our equal. What we need is a South Slavic puppet, completely subservient to us, managing the Balkans on our behalf!"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_6_title:0 "Subjugate the South Slavs"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_6_desc:0 "The unruly South Slavs have fallen, kneeling at our feet to accept our rule. The pungent smell of gunpowder from the Balkan powder keg has been extinguished by Venetian hands. We must consider how to govern the South Slavs. They have never lacked a spirit of resistance. Embracing them may win their acceptance, while forced cultural transformation might break their will."

EDG_VEN_mission_5_1_title:0 "Italian Foreign Policy"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_1_desc:0 "Regardless of the vastness of our overseas territories, our homeland remains in Italy, where we must inevitably confront the intricate Italian situation. Over the past thirty years, our greatest enemy has been the rising Duchy of Lombardy, or rather, the Viceroy of Italy. The aggressive Filippo forcefully seized the cities of Bergamo and Brescia from us and instigated the independence of Verona, a constant source of pain for us. How we handle relations with Lombardy and other Italian states is now a pressing issue before us."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_2_title:0 "Seize the Opportunity"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_2_desc:0 "Unprecedented good news has reached Venice. The legendary figure who has weighed heavily on Venice for over thirty years, Duke of Lombardy and Viceroy of Italy, Filippo, has passed away, leaving behind an underage heir. Lombardy is plunged into unprecedented chaos. Undoubtedly, now is the best time to claim the title of Duke of Lombardy.\n\n§GNote: This will be one of your methods to resolve the Dandolo family's succession crisis.§!"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_3_title:0 "Continue the Conquest" # Continue the Italian Conquest
EDG_VEN_mission_5_3_desc:0 "When our most esteemed Venetian monarch rode a tall steed into Milan, no one anticipated that the situation in Northern Italy would conclude in such a manner. The Duchy of Lombardy, the former ruler of Northern Italy, has become history. The rising Venice has replaced its former position, becoming the new hegemon of Northern Italy. In the past, Venice focused on overseas expansion because it was powerless in the Italian region. Now, it is time to begin the conquest of Italy, unifying this chaotic land under a single voice."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_4_title:0 "Century-Long Rivalry Ends" # The Century-Long Rivalry Concludes
EDG_VEN_mission_5_4_desc:0 "At the other end of the Apennine Peninsula, on the shores of the Ligurian Sea, Genoa has been Venice's major trade competitor in the Mediterranean for the past two to three hundred years. Although both the War of Saint Sabas and the War of Chioggia ended in Venetian victories, dealing heavy blows to Genoese trade expansion, they never completely ended Genoa. Now, as Venetian troops march into the city of Genoa, we can finally solemnly declare that the century-long rivalry has been brought to a perfect conclusion."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_5_title:0 "Enter Palazzo dei Fiori" # Enter the Palazzo dei Fiori
EDG_VEN_mission_5_5_desc:0 "The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore was transformed into the Palazzo dei Fiori during the Florentine despotic rule, becoming the de facto center of power in Florence. One generation after another of Central Italian leaders issued commands from here, playing a pivotal role in Italian affairs. Now that Venice has taken control of this magnificent cathedral, Florence's history comes to an end."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_6_title:0 "Venice First, Pope Second"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_6_desc:0 "The conflict between Venice and the Papal States has a long history, dating back to Venice's republican era. For this reason, Venice even proclaimed the slogan 'Venice First, Pope Second,' attempting to completely exclude Papal interference in Venetian domestic affairs. However, implementing this slogan has always been difficult. Now, with our control over Rome and the Pope's hurried flight, we have finally made this slogan a reality."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_7_title:0 "The Title of King of Italy" # Claim the Title of King of Italy
EDG_VEN_mission_5_7_desc:0 "Northern Italy is now entirely in Venetian hands. Venice, Milan, Genoa, Florence, Rome—every renowned Italian name, every former power center in the Northern Italian power struggle, is now a part of Venetian rule. There is no doubt: we have a legitimate and legal reason to formally claim the title of King of Italy and ascend this coveted throne."

EDG_VEN_mission_1_7_title:0 "Resolve the Crisis" # Resolve the Succession Crisis
EDG_VEN_mission_1_7_desc:0 "The issue of Francesco Steno Dandolo having no male heirs has long been a severe concern for the Dandolo family and the entire Venetian Monarchy. Domestically, many anti-monarchists are already stirring. They have adopted the flag of the former Venetian Republic, the blue field with the golden lion, as their symbol. We must resolve this unfavorable situation quickly, or Venice will plunge into serious division.\n\n§RWarning: Strive to avoid the Dandolo succession crisis and the subsequent War of the Red and Blue Lions disaster at all costs, as the consequences are extremely severe!§!"

EDG_VEN_mission_1_8_title:0 "Purge the Ziani Family" # Thoroughly Purge the Ziani Family
EDG_VEN_mission_1_8_desc:0 "The Ziani family, a significant family of great influence since the Venetian Republic, has been actively scheming within Venice ever since the Dandolo family deviated from Venetian tradition by not intermarrying within the Council of Ten, which represents the interests of Venice's great plutocratic nobles. Their attempts to overthrow Dandolo rule now appear utterly laughable. It is time to strike with a heavy hand, swatting away this buzzing fly and purging the Ziani family completely. How can Venice be governed properly with pests like the Ziani family around!"

EDG_VEN_mission_1_9_title:0 "Restrict the Council of Ten" # Restrict the Power of the Council of Ten
EDG_VEN_mission_1_9_desc:0 "The Council of Ten, an institution existing since the Venetian Republic, was initially an annually elected administrative body responsible for police and defense matters. Its jurisdiction included morality, public order, rebels, and foreign enemies. However, it gradually evolved into representing the ten most powerful plutocratic nobles within Venice. The Dandolo family's heavy reliance on the Council of Ten in the past has already had serious consequences. The Council's power must be restricted immediately."

EDG_VEN_mission_1_10_title:0 "Venice's New Era"
EDG_VEN_mission_1_10_desc:0 "The Dandolo succession crisis, the Ziani family conspiracy, the Council of Ten seizing power—through it all, Venice has weathered countless storms and faced various challenges and hardships. Fortunately, the Dandolo family and the Venetian Monarchy have had the last laugh. A new era for Venice has arrived!"

EDG_VEN_mission_2_7_title:0 "New Piles"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_7_desc:0 "Venice's origins lie in a small fishing village, and the wooden piles used for mooring boats are its spiritual symbol. Today, those original piles have aged. We need to expand and create new piles to enlarge our city."
EDG_VEN_mission_2_8_title:0 "Expand the Carnival Scale"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_8_desc:0 "Venice has a long tradition of holding carnivals, and the fame of the Venetian Carnival has long been renowned throughout Europe. Piazza San Marco, La Fenice Opera House—these famous landmarks have all witnessed the grand Venetian Carnival. We need to expand these great structures used for the carnival celebrations to enlarge the scale of our carnival."
EDG_VEN_mission_2_9_title:0 "Venetian Metropolis"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_9_desc:0 "The city of Venice is far more than just a small island city, nor merely the tiny fishing village it once was. It shall be a great metropolis, a metropolis shining over the entire Adriatic Sea, a metropolis shining over all of Italy, and even a metropolis shining over all of Europe—the Venetian Metropolis!"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_10_title:0 "The Heart of Venice"
EDG_VEN_mission_2_10_desc:0 "The city of Venice, the capital of the Venetian Monarchy, the great heart of Venice. Generation after generation of brilliant Dandolo rulers have strategized and commanded from within Venice, leading the Venetian Monarchy from one victory to the next. We must solidify Venice's crucial position as the great heart of the Venetian Monarchy. No other city can replace the status of Venice."

EDG_VEN_mission_3_7_title:0 "Monopolize the Adriatic Sea"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_7_desc:0 "The Adriatic Sea is the narrow body of water between the Apennine and Balkan Peninsulas, serving as the fundamental base for Venice's vast trade network. A multitude of merchant ships traverse these waters, the vast majority of which are inextricably linked to Venice. Venice must monopolize trade in the Adriatic Sea to lay claim to greater trade hegemony."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_8_title:0 "Monopolize the Ligurian" # Monopolize the Ligurian Sea
EDG_VEN_mission_3_8_desc:0 "Opposite the Adriatic Sea lies the Ligurian Sea, situated on the other side of the Apennine Peninsula, together encircling it. Venetian merchants' ambitions cannot be satisfied with merely monopolizing the trade routes on the eastern side of the Apennine Peninsula; the trade on the western side should also be firmly held in Venetian hands."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_9_title:0 "Monopolize Italy's Wealth"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_9_desc:0 "Italy's richness makes it a coveted prize for expanding nations. In our hands, this richness will accelerate our rise as a European power. By introducing modern economic practices and investing in our urban development, we can transform our nation into a power capable of dominating the world. Political leadership will inevitably follow economic hegemony."
EDG_VEN_mission_3_10_title:0 "The Future of Trade"
EDG_VEN_mission_3_10_desc:0 "The value and wealth generated by trade are immeasurable. Any visionary economist can conclude without hesitation that trade is the mainstream of future world economic development, and a nation's primary fiscal revenue will inevitably depend on trade. This is the future of trade. Having accumulated strength over a long period and benefiting from a long-standing trade tradition, the Venetian Monarchy is bound to lead the way in this new era."

EDG_VEN_mission_4_7_title:0 "More Condottieri"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_7_desc:0 "Venice never spares expense, nor lacks military funding. In the Italian region, many renowned condottieri have risen to fame. Among them are numerous wandering nobles, forced to lead their retinues as mercenaries after losing their lands, as well as children of merchants or artisans who become mercenaries for dreams and wealth. We can recruit them all for our own use."
EDG_VEN_mission_4_8_title:0 "Contractor's Gift" # The Contractor's Gift
EDG_VEN_mission_4_8_desc:0 "Venice's emphasis on national defense and military power has gradually evolved into a reputation for generosity towards mercenaries, spreading throughout Italy. As the contractor for mercenary companies, Venice offers gifts too expensive for them to refuse. This unparalleled generosity naturally brings returns; the mercenary companies become fearless, joining the Venetian ranks one after another."
EDG_VEN_mission_4_9_title:0 "Condottieri Lords" # Italian Condottieri Lords
EDG_VEN_mission_4_9_desc:0 "Italian problems should be resolved in Italy. Rashly introducing powers from outside Italy into the struggle only leads to dependency, debt, and loss of sovereignty—it's like inviting a wolf into the house. We must rely on ourselves. We are the Condottieri Lords of Italy!"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_10_title:0 "Arm Ourselves with Gold"
EDG_VEN_mission_4_10_desc:0 "Whether it's all the treaties we sign, all the agreements we reach, or all the promises we make to our people—to fulfill these, the military power of our Venetian Monarchy must be strong. If anyone harbors the slightest doubt about our commitments, our diplomatic and military actions could all end in failure."

EDG_VEN_mission_5_8_title:0 "The Galley Arsenal"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_8_desc:0 "The long history of the Venetian Galley Arsenal goes without saying. As early as the 12th century, Venice was consciously expanding the Galley Arsenal, stockpiling various naval armaments, and training sailors, establishing a fine military tradition. This ensured the formidable combat strength of Venetian galleys in the Mediterranean. The brilliant victories at the Battle of Saint Sabas and the Battle of Chioggia are the best proof."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_9_title:0 "Eagles of the Sea"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_9_desc:0 "If we can maintain our naval superiority, it will pave the way for conquering all of Italy and even the Mediterranean region. We must continue to expand our navy to ensure this becomes reality. We are the Eagles of the Sea; the shadow beneath our wings will envelop the entire Mediterranean."
EDG_VEN_mission_5_10_title:0 "Combined Naval Tactics"
EDG_VEN_mission_5_10_desc:0 "Everything requires innovation. What era is it now, and we're still talking about traditional naval tactics? Generations of Venetian naval education have cultivated a group of naval reformers rich in theoretical knowledge. They creatively proposed combined naval tactics, with excellent examples being the Venetian galleass and the East Indiaman."
