LUU_1: "No Distinction Between Hua and Yi"
LUU_1_desc: "If the Central Realm has already fallen, must it necessarily be its own people who govern it well? The Sage said: 'When the Yi adopt the ways of the Central Realm, they become part of it.' If there are those who excel, they may be accepted, they may be followed—what matters whether they are of the Central Realm or of the Yi? Today, those who can employ scholars and practice the Way of the Central Realm are its rightful rulers."
LUU_2: "Three Bonds and Five Constants"
LUU_2_desc: "Only the Son of Heaven receives the Mandate from Heaven, and Heaven entrusts that Mandate to the Son of Heaven. The Way of Heaven favors Yang over Yin. The principles of ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife all derive from the Dao of Yin and Yang: the ruler is Yang, the subject Yin; the father is Yang, the son Yin; the husband is Yang, the wife Yin."
LUU_3: "Civilizing the Barbarians"
LUU_3_desc: "People possess the Three Bonds and Five Constants, and by illuminating the Eight Virtues—filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame—they become Hua. Barbarians lack propriety, but by venerating Confucius and honoring the literati, the continuity of the Dao can be preserved, and they too may enter Xia (civilization)."
LUU_4: "Kong Family Scholarship"
LUU_4_desc: "Using the residence as a temple, preserving ritual music, robes, and vessels; generation after generation inheriting family learning, serving as both teachers and peers to one another."
LUU_5: "Muster Local Militias"
LUU_5_desc: "The poor of western Shandong are generally skilled in combat. These simple locals, defending their homes and land, when mustered and promised slight reductions in rent and tribute, become fearless warriors—the sharpest weapon in guarding the teachings of the Mingjiao."
LUU_6: "Tribute and Corvée Service"
LUU_6_desc: "As guardians of the holy site and sacred lineage, to ensure the eternal stability of the Dao and protect the sages' temples, the Duke Yansheng's estate demands extra tribute and unpaid corvée labor from peasants to cover expenses, improve the management of the Six Great Halls, and recruit temple stewards."
LUU_7: "Sagely Learning Governs Peace"
LUU_7_desc: "Heaven cannot have two suns; scholars cannot have two kings; a household cannot have two masters; there cannot be two supreme authorities. This teaches the people the distinction between ruler and subject. Human relations—ruler and subject, father and son, noble and base—are orderly and cannot be inverted, just as a cap cannot be worn as shoes."
