They have consistently enjoyed amicable cooperation with the Caliphate of Córdoba and its successors. Consequently, some ministers have proposed to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that these Mozarabs, who also do not follow the Roman Rite, could be integrated into the empire's Coptic class, allowing them to assist the Malik in reconstructing the administrative system of Al-Andalus."

Preceding conquerors of India, centered on the ruling class, divided society into numerous endogamous groups based on occupation—the castes.

Just as Benghazi teetered on the brink of collapse, news of a great victory arrived from [361.GetName]: the seaborne Crusader force had been completely annihilated. Upon hearing this, the Templars fled westward in panic, lifting the siege of Cyrenaica. Times have changed; we are not the declining Ayyubid Dynasty, and the Crusaders of the Maghreb are no longer as fierce and skilled in battle as they once were.

For centuries thereafter, his descendants established the Caliphate of Córdoba, which became the jewel of Islam in the West, a colossal entity before which European Christians prostrated. However, this golden age did not last. The incompetent and unvirtuous Umayyads ultimately proved unfit for their great responsibility. In the wake of their dramatic collapse, the Crusader kings audaciously declared independence and launched their so-called Reconquista against the south, dimming the glory of Islam. Now, Sahada has firmly established itself on the peninsula, surpassing the Umayyad rulers, completing a re-reconquest, and becoming the commander of the faithful in Al-Andalus.

EDG_FYM_mission_3_11_desc:0 "The Apostle Peter, a disciple of the Prophet Isa, distorted Isa's teachings and founded the so-called Christian Church upon lies, spreading false faith across the lands of Europe for over a millennium. Today, the city of Rome—the former heart of the Roman Empire and the Christian world, the seat of the Apostle Peter's legacy—has fallen into our hands. This is the decisive victory of the Muslim faithful over the idolaters. Let us humiliate the Apostle Peter and let the world hear the true faith."

EDG_FYM_mission_3_14_desc:0 "We have long referred to Iran as 'Bilad Faris'—the 'Greater Fars.' This land is both the ancestral home of Persian empires like the Achaemenids and the domain where mounted conquerors such as the Ilkhanate left their mark.

EDG_FYM_mission_3_16_desc:0 "The vastness and fertility of the Deccan Plateau have secretly astonished us, and the skilled Maratha warriors there have earned our quiet admiration. Many of these brave Indians have already become our slaves, with some even rising to become high-ranking Mamluk officials. These slave officers and civil officials of Maratha origin have proposed that their people be formally integrated into the imperial administrative system, serving as the empire's agents on the Deccan Plateau."

Based on Ismaili doctrine, deeply influenced by Neo-Platonism, Christianity, and Buddhist thought, they are highly integrated with the Druze. Having absorbed much from the Renaissance and Western European religious reform movements, they have now spread throughout the Near East.

However, this glorious era ended in 1258 when the Mongols sacked Baghdad and terminated the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nFor centuries, the Islamic world has been fragmented, allowing external forces to exploit our weaknesses. Division inevitably leads to failure. As the de facto successor to the Caliphate, our armies must unite the Islamic world and rekindle the torch of Islamic civilization's progress."

EDG_FYM_mission_3_29_desc:0 "The Mamluks, the Bedouin tribes, and the Yemeni Emirs are all crucial components of Sahada's military power structure. By nature, each stratum attempts to weaken the authority of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in order to enhance its own power. However, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will not remain passive; instead, he will quietly exploit the conflicts among them, provoking internal strife and competition between the different strata, thereby gaining better control over the military."

Some ministers have proposed to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that, since the 'slave' resources used to manage the provinces are becoming increasingly strained, why not designate certain provinces specifically for slave-breeding? Undoubtedly, this proposal would elevate the feudal system of the Sahada Empire to new heights."

EDG_FYM_mission_3_31_title:0 "Born for War"

EDG_FYM_mission_4_2_desc:0 "The beautiful Levant once nearly slipped from our grasp, but the three northern vassals, upon recognizing the determination and resolve of the Sahada Dynasty, chose to fully submit to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and relinquish their autonomy.

EDG_FYM_mission_4_20_desc:0 "The delicate symbiotic relationship between the Sahada Empire and the Coptic Church has long been a subject of wonder, seen as a remarkably successful and mutually beneficial cooperation. However, all things cast shadows. When faith once again rises above profit in people's hearts, the source of calamity emerges. Thus, the occurrence of the grandiose 'Messiah' event in the first half of the 16th century seems hardly surprising."

EDG_FYM_mission_4_22_title:0 "The Karimi Merchants"
EDG_FYM_mission_4_22_desc:0 "The Karimi merchants originally emerged as a group of Indian traders; their name 'Karimi' may derive from the Tamil word karyam (meaning 'commercial affairs'). Around the late 12th century, they rose to become a significant trade consortium by purchasing naval escort services to defend against pirates in the Red Sea and the Strait of Mandeb. By the time of the Sahada Dynasty, this group had evolved into a transregional merchant alliance predominantly composed of native Egyptians, though membership was not exclusive to them. In our efforts to expand trade and increase profits from overseas investments, the Karimi merchants, responsible for transporting spices and other goods, are our powerful allies."

EDG_FYM_mission_4_24_desc:0 "Although we once rescued the Fatimid Caliph from peril, personally served as his guardian, and truly brought Shia faith to its zenith, the absence of the Prophet's bloodline has persistently cast doubt upon our rule. Ultimately, under a confluence of various factors, many Shia believers rallied behind the so-called 'Successor of Ali' and began to rebel against Sahada's authority. In that case, we can only tell the rebels: Only the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Allah are eternal."

EDG_FYM_mission_4_28_desc:0 "To balance the Mamluks, the Yemeni Emirs, and the Bedouin tribes, the Sahada Dynasty has long imported mercenaries of Greek origin from both sides of the Aegean Sea. These immigrants, who have established autonomous communities of varying sizes in Egypt known as 'Emilia' (Nomoi), are also called 'Nomoi.' They maintain a high degree of personal dependence on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], resulting in unwavering loyalty to the Sahada Dynasty, and have thus become a tool for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to counterbalance the domestic military elite."

EDG_FYM_mission_4_29_title:0 "The Loyalty of the Asadat"
EDG_FYM_mission_4_29_desc:0 "The Mamluks primarily draw their manpower from white slaves of the northern Black Sea and Caucasian regions. These pagan slaves were either offered as tribute to the Sultan by eastern provinces or purchased directly by the Sultan. Indoctrinated with Islamic teachings and loyalty to their master from childhood, they were enrolled in specialized military training after the age of fourteen. The commander of the Royal Mamluks is called the 'Atabeg,' while the Mamluk warriors are known as the 'Asadat' (originally meaning the Egyptian god of fertility and war), referring to the former as father. We must control these elite warriors with absolute authority to avoid a tragedy akin to that of the Ayyubid Dynasty."

They are well-trained, well-equipped, and highly proficient with firearms, constituting an indispensable part of the military strength of Iranian warlords and even serving as the origin of the present Mamluk system.

Seizing this place, occupying the entire land between the two rivers, proclaims to the world that the great Sahada Malik is the 'Ilm' (lit. knowledge, authority) above the Caliph, the living saint of the Islamic world.

EDG_FYM_mission_5_12_desc:0 "The Zagros Mountains, running northwest-southeast, form the natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Mesopotamian Plain, long hindering direct control from either side. Consequently, the Abbasid Caliphate, with its core of rule in the plains of the Two Rivers, struggled to govern Persia effectively, ultimately leading to Iran's independent course and the empire's decline. But we are the true Sword of Allah, the guardian of the Abbasid Caliph, destined to surpass the achievements of previous dynasties and ensure the land of Iranshahr submits to imperial rule for generations to come."
