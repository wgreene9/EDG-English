EDG_Shangbang_republic:0 "Shangbang Governance" # Merchant Guild Governance
EDG_Shangbang_republic_desc:0 "Merchants naturally connect through local and kinship ties, supporting one another and working in harmony, thereby becoming both price-takers and price-setters who can influence market prices. Concurrently, merchant guilds avoid internal cutthroat competition and bolster external competitiveness, while also leveraging collective strength for better protection within the feudal system. During the late Yuan dynasty, amid warlord conflicts and fragmentation, under political maneuvering, the power in some cities was controlled by merchant guilds. Regimes that emerged under this specific economic and social context are referred to as merchant guild-governed polities."
     
EDG_CN_Squire_family:0 "Local Magnate Clan"
EDG_CN_Squire_family_desc:0 "We tentatively term the power structure of a regime led by the most powerful local landlord family with long-term control as a 'local magnate clan.' In such regimes, vast lands are treated as the magnate's private property. The magnate resides in their enormous estate, controls extensive territories, and exploits and governs the local peasantry."

EDG_CN_Xungui_family:0 "Military Aristocrat Clan"
EDG_CN_Xungui_family_desc:0 "We tentatively term the power structure of a regime led by the most powerful local military aristocrat family with long-term control as a 'military aristocrat clan.' Military aristocrats utilized their prestige, networks, wealth, and armed forces to achieve high levels of control over local power."

EDG_CN_Squire_supervises:0 "Gentry-Overseen Governance"
EDG_CN_Squire_supervises_desc:0 "The gentry class is a distinctive stratum in Chinese feudal society, primarily composed of individuals influential in rural communities: those who passed imperial examinations but never held office or failed the exams, local small to medium landlords with some education, minor officials retired or convalescing long-term in their hometowns, and clan elders. They resemble officials yet differ from them; they are akin to commoners yet stand above them. Although some may have held limited authority, and a very few might have advanced to government posts, overall, they consistently occupied the position of the 'pure critics' within feudal society and the 'out-of-power faction' of the ruling group. The various social statuses they acquired were typical manifestations of the feudal ruling structure's operation within rural social organizations. The gentry class served as the bridge between feudal rulers and the lower peasantry. Once this bridge loosened or disintegrated, social and political order would descend into chaos; in our polity, this is even more pronounced. The gentry bloc fundamentally controls the regime's power, with the figureheads being agents put forward by the gentry group."

EDG_CN_Xungui_Politics:0 "Military Aristocrat Politics"
EDG_CN_Xungui_Politics_desc:0 "We tentatively term the power structure of a polity jointly ruled by multiple local military aristocrat families as 'military aristocrat politics.' Among these families, none can achieve absolute control over the locality, so they collude to oppress other social classes."

EDG_CN_Mongolian_aristocracy:0 "Mongol Aristocratic Rule"
EDG_CN_Mongolian_aristocracy_desc:0 "In this polity, supreme power is held by Mongol nobles who have not been sinicized. The Mongols retain the characteristics of their original military forces, and their cooperation with Han Chinese landlord-bureaucrats is ineffective."

EDG_CN_bureaucrat_dictatorship:0 "Bureaucratic Dictatorship"
EDG_CN_bureaucrat_dictatorship_desc:0 "The administrative chief is a bureaucrat appointed by the imperial court. Our authority derives from the court, yet we still possess significant autonomy."

EDG_chinese_warlord:0 "Contending Warlords"
EDG_chinese_warlord_desc:0 "China is in a period where powerful local magnates rise and fragmentation prevails. The imperial court is powerless to control the regions; this situation must be changed. We will become a formidable contender to unify China."
