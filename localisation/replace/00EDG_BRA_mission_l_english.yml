EDG_BRA_mission_1_1_title:0 "The Deal with the Teutonic Order"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Pressed by lack of funds and political instability, our ancestors pragmatically pawned the lands of Neumark to the Teutonic Order. However, immigrants from Brandenburg have previously claimed ownership of this region, and the local burghers assert that the Order entirely neglects them. The Teutonic Order is prepared to mortgage Neumark to the King of Poland, yet the burgher class of Neumark opposes this resolution. Provided the Order receives adequate compensation, we have good reason to believe the Grand Master would accept our proposal to repurchase the province."

EDG_BRA_mission_1_2_title:0 "The Nordmark Gambit"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_2_desc:0 "The Elector of Nordmark holds a pivotal position in the north. Nordmark has long been hostile towards Saxony and has repeatedly coveted Brandenburg territories in the past, making it an undeniable presence for the nascent Margraviate of Brandenburg. With the passing of Sigismund and the arrival of the Habsburg dynasty, we possess an opportunity others scarcely have time to consider amidst this chaos: to eliminate Nordmark, to ally with the Duke of Saxony in crushing Nordmark, or perhaps to forge a lasting friendship and focus fully eastward?"

EDG_BRA_mission_1_4_title:0 "The Copper Crown of Poland"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_4_desc:0 "The Polish lands have long been mired in endless strife; war and disorder have brought ruin here. Now, we have brought Poland into our fold. The Hohenzollerns will not betray the Polish people's hopes for stability. Poland shall be revitalized under Hohenzollern rule."

EDG_BRA_mission_1_5_title:0 "End the Hanseatic League"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_5_desc:0 "With the fall of Saxony, our conflict with the Emperor intensifies. We must consolidate all forces to enhance our strength as much as possible, reaching a position where we can rival the Emperor. The Hanseatic League has amassed immense wealth in Northern Germany and monopolizes most trade. Ending the Hanseatic League's existence will facilitate our gathering of strength for the coming challenges."

EDG_BRA_mission_1_6_title:0 "No Right to Interfere"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_6_desc:0 "With the Grand Marshal's downfall, our influence in Northern Germany has become pivotal. Through persistent advocacy, we assert that our conquests are far from illegitimate. Our eloquence leaves even the Emperor's envoy abashed; his decree of unlawful territory is mere empty words, utterly meaningless to the Hohenzollerns!"

EDG_BRA_mission_1_8_title:0 "The Fear of the Danish Confederation"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_8_desc:0 "Denmark has long been part of the Holy Roman Empire. Though geographically Nordic, in the eyes of the German princes, it is an inseparable part of the German lands. With the Hohenzollerns' rapid rise, the Danish Confederation's era of peaceful days has vanished. Its rulers feel a deep dread for the impending fate. It is time to sever the Danish Confederation from the Holy Roman Empire and make it a part of Germany."

EDG_BRA_mission_1_9_title:0 "The Shattered Danish Dream"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_9_desc:0 "Denmark has become sacred and indivisible territory in our vision; it should be part of the German lands. Denmark alone will only submit to Hohenzollern authority. Should anyone obstruct this, the Hohenzollerns will shatter that barrier with the resolve to unify the German region!"

EDG_BRA_mission_1_10_title:0 "The Lion's Lament"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_10_desc:0 "The Nordic region has been inhabited by North Germanic peoples since ancient times. We who inherit the glory of Germania must bring this proud lion to its knees, integrating it into the greater Germanian family. Under the rule brought by the House of Hohenzollern, they shall no longer be independent, no longer 'Nordics,' but Germans."

EDG_BRA_mission_1_11_title:0 "The Nightmare of the Slavs"
EDG_BRA_mission_1_11_desc:0 "The Rus, Poles, Lithuanians, and others—how laughable. Centuries ago, they were all Germans, yet they fought each other to assert their distinctiveness. We who inherit the glory of Germania must bring a nightmare upon these self-proclaimed 'Slavs,' these East Germans, compelling them to abandon their separatism and merge into the greater Germanian family, basking in the rule brought by the House of Hohenzollern."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_1_title:0 "No Longer a Pawn"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_1_desc:0 "Upon Sigismund's death, we broke free from the personal union with Bohemia, gaining independent sovereignty. Yet, the risk of becoming a manipulated subject again remains. We must immediately prepare; with sufficient military strength and outstanding diplomacy, we may secure a temporary truce with those holding claims to the duchy, buying us a breathing space."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_2_title:0 "Like an Autumn Wind Sweeping Leaves"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Pomerania, Pomerania! You possess the broadest coasts of Northern Germany, drawing wealth from the Baltic Sea. If Brandenburg is to truly rise, we must take this region swiftly, like an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_3_title:0 "Attend to Both East and West"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_3_desc:0 "Under Hohenzollern rule, Brandenburg is revitalized, already a pivotal border state in Northern Germany. Following the Hohenzollern will, we cannot linger in momentary triumph but must elevate our vision to match our current standing. The King and Chancellor debated whether to expand eastward for vast territories or challenge Saxony's position westward. Ultimately, they reached an agreement: we shall have it all."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_4_title:0 "The North Needs No Grand Marshal"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_4_desc:0 "The House of Welf, its fame long-lasting within the Empire, its achievements passed down through the ages—until the Duke of Saxony's downfall, he was the undeniable northwestern pillar of the Empire. Yet, his erroneous vacillations left him unsatisfying to the Emperor, the Pope, and the pietists alike. In the end, the House of Welf was betrayed by the 'heretics' he had generously accepted, and was utterly defeated on the battlefield by the Hohenzollern armies. Now, we stand equal to the former Grand Marshal. We shall proclaim to the German lands: the North needs no Welf Grand Marshal."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_5_title:0 "Blood Rain at the Sydney River"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_5_desc:0 "With the fall of Saxony, our conflict with the Emperor intensifies. We must consolidate all forces to enhance our strength as much as possible, reaching a position where we can rival the Emperor. The lands across the Sydney River are among the few fertile territories in Northern Germany. Take them, bring them under Hohenzollern rule."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_6_title:0 "The Lowlands, Grasped in My Palm"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_6_desc:0 "The Low Countries have since ancient times been the richest lands in the German region. The wealth they generate is coveted by all of Europe—Britain, France, the Holy Roman Empire—all have contended for them. Now, the Low Countries lie before us like a naked beauty, awaiting the favor and rule of the House of Hohenzollern."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_7_title:0 "Leave the Holy Roman Empire"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_7_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is but a puppet under papal coronation. The Emperor and the Pope, in the name of the Holy Roman Empire, exploit the fragmented principalities of Northern Germany, constantly extracting nourishment to fuel their greedy, barbaric growth, leaving Northern Germany in ruins. The Holy Roman Empire has never safeguarded our interests nor resolved the actual disputes among the princes. Now, we and the Emperor have cast off pretense and torn the mask. With the birth of Protestantism, we have found the ideological armament needed to leave the Holy Roman Empire. Now, we shall refuse further service to the Holy Roman Empire crowned by the Pope and publicly proclaim to the entire continent: We leave the Holy Roman Empire! We are free, independent!"

EDG_BRA_mission_2_8_title:0 "Bare the Sword to the Emperor"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_8_desc:0 "The ancient Holy Roman Empire, having existed in Europe for many years, was a loose confederation of the German nation and a political stage where princes and nobles of the German states continuously vied for German leadership. For centuries, many Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire nominally ruled all of Germany, possessing independent sovereignty, yet were subject to constraints from foreign powers, especially France. The Holy Roman Empire should be swept into the dustbin of history. Germany should be more cohesive, united together. Under the leadership of the House of Hohenzollern, Prussia actively engages in war preparations, determined to use military force to resolve the issue of Prussian hegemony in Germany."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_9_title:0 "The Peace of Prague"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_9_desc:0 "As the war continued, the Holy Roman Emperor could no longer reverse the situation; defeat was inevitable. Prussia and Austria negotiated peace in Prague, signing the famous Treaty of Prague. The treaty stipulated that the Emperor would dissolve the Holy Roman Empire and cede all territories in North Germany and South Germany (excluding Swiss and Austrian culture provinces) to Prussia. This treaty laid the groundwork for German unification."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_10_title:0 "Three Cheers for Germany"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_10_desc:0 "With the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Danish-Prussian War, the time for German unification is at hand. Over the long years, we have continuously tempered and solidified our national identity. Once, each principality was hostile to the others, each person thinking first of their own state rather than being German. Now, through military means, we have strengthened German national cohesion and united together. There is no more opportune moment to establish the German Empire. Three cheers for the German Empire!"

EDG_BRA_mission_2_11_title:0 "§MTimed Mission:§! Deception"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_11_desc:0 "We have been secretly spreading an ambiguous rumor: that we shelter all heretics whose beliefs differ from the Roman Church. In truth, we only shelter the Hussites. However, members of the Euchite sect in Saxony might believe this rumor. With Saxony's reconciliation with the Emperor, Euchite adherents in Saxony no longer feel safe. Perhaps we can send them a false signal, offering shelter under the pretense of protecting heretics in exchange for their support, aiding us in gaining a more legitimate opportunity to challenge Saxony."

EDG_BRA_mission_2_12_title:0 "The End of the Euchites"
EDG_BRA_mission_2_12_desc:0 "Saxony has fallen. The Euchites are celebrating, rejoicing in another new victory. But they forget: traitors are not trusted by vested interests either. It is time to tell them the truth and, simultaneously, deal with them."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_2_title:0 "The Ruppin Succession Issue"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The territories controlled by the Vassal State of Ruppin are interlocked with Brandenburg's. Ruppin has long been hostile towards Lübeck and has repeatedly clashed with Brandenburg in the past, with lands changing hands between them. It is an undeniable presence for the nascent Margraviate of Brandenburg. With the passing of Sigismund and the arrival of the Habsburg dynasty, we possess an opportunity others scarcely have time to consider amidst this chaos: to eliminate Ruppin, to ally with Lübeck in crushing Ruppin, or perhaps to forge a lasting friendship and focus fully eastward?"

EDG_BRA_mission_3_4_title:0 "Laying Hands on Prussia"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_4_desc:0 "The Prussian region boasts the fine port of Danzig, sturdy fortresses, and the capable, warlike Prussians. Yet, the Teutonic Order's occupation wastes the region's potential. The Margraviate of Brandenburg under Hohenzollern rule will certainly realize this land's true value."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_5_title:0 "The True Heir of Franconia"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_5_desc:0 "As our relations with the Emperor rupture, the balance of power between us shifts. The Franconian region once promised to the Emperor should rightfully be reclaimed. There are no eternal agreements in diplomacy; might stems from the edge of the sword, truth lies within cannon range. We believe the "true heir" is determined not by bloodline, but by strength."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_6_title:0 "Swabia, Your Master Has Returned"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_6_desc:0 "Centuries ago, we were driven out of Swabia. Now, the Swabian region lies before us like a lamb to the slaughter. We shall avenge this past humiliation and issue an ultimatum to the princes of Swabia: it is time to recognize your true master."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_8_title:0 "Swords Pointed at the Fleur-de-lis"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_8_desc:0 "France has been continuously entangled with the former Holy Roman Empire over territories in Germany and Italy. Throughout this period, to maintain its own hegemony, France constantly interfered in German affairs. Even after our rise, it sought to preserve instability in the East through repeated interventions. If we are to unite the German princes, binding them together to fight for a common goal, then shattering the myth of French invincibility and reclaiming all that France once usurped in German lands has become a necessary step before German unification."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_9_title:0 "The Treaty of Versailles"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_9_desc:0 "As the war continued, France could no longer reverse the situation; defeat was inevitable. Prussia and France negotiated peace at Versailles, signing the famous Treaty of Versailles. The treaty stipulated that France would cede all territories in North Germany and South Germany and pay substantial war reparations to Prussia. This treaty laid the groundwork for German unification."

EDG_BRA_mission_3_10_title:0 "Shelter the Hussites"
EDG_BRA_mission_3_10_desc:0 "The event of Jan Hus filled all Hussites with grief. To prove the Hohenzollern family would not betray the aid of Hussite members, we must respect their faith and provide motivation for them to continue friendly relations with Brandenburg. The Duke decided to discreetly position himself as a haven for heretics without public declaration, ensuring room for maneuver in the future."

EDG_BRA_mission_4_2_title:0 "Shatter the Interference"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_2_desc:0 "With the crisis over, Frederick III eradicated all enemies threatening Hohenzollern power, bringing Hohenzollern control over the Margraviate of Brandenburg to its peak. After shattering the interference, Frederick III enacted a series of laws conducive to centralization. In this region where nobles were purged, burghers subdued, and clerical influence distant, Frederick III crushed all interference, enabling the forceful implementation of his will."

EDG_BRA_mission_4_3_title:0 "Resolve the Succession Issue"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_3_desc:0 "After the prolonged strife, concerns arose that the lands might split again in the future. In the past, we fought with other members of our own family, with foreign nobles, and even with the old nobility entrenched in Brandenburg. Our rule was once so precarious it nearly vanished entirely. As is well known, even powerful states have suffered due to a lack of proper laws governing land ownership—something rulers should avoid. If we wish to preserve Brandenburg forever from disaster, we must enact a lasting house law to permanently secure our territories."

EDG_BRA_mission_4_4_title:0 "§RExclusive Mission:§! The Germanic Mercenary Corps"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_4_desc:0 "We followed the Junkers' counsel, systematically organizing and managing mercenaries. We established long-term agreements and a fixed procedural framework with several major mercenary companies to ensure their combat effectiveness and costs were no longer exorbitant. We implemented this systematic approach to employing mercenary corps to its fullest extent."

EDG_BRA_mission_4_5_title:0 "The Germanic Anthem"

EDG_BRA_mission_4_7_desc:0 "Albert III found himself at a disadvantage in wars against Denmark and Sweden. Consequently, he ordered the cabinet to systematically plan a direction for strengthening the navy. After six months of planning and coordination, the cabinet presented a satisfactory solution. Under the leadership of the exceptional Naval Minister, Jomir Télanyi, a national navy rose from the ground. Albert III spared no expense for the navy and refrained from blind haste or interference. With such enlightened support, the navy was able to catch up resolutely."

EDG_BRA_mission_4_8_title:0 "The Spokesman for Germany"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_8_desc:0 "As our strength in the German lands grows ever greater, even surpassing the influence wielded by the Holy Roman Emperor, the Holy Roman Empire is no longer the unshakable spokesman for Germany; it no longer deserves the title of German Empire. We, the Hohenzollern dynasty, are the true spokesman for the German lands. We have the responsibility and the capability to lead Germany's tomorrow!"

EDG_BRA_mission_4_1_title:0 "The Rise of the House of Hohenzollern"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_1_desc:0 "Following the demise of Sigismund and the end of the Franconian succession crisis, Wilhelm II, head of the House of Hohenzollern, backed by the new Emperor, resolutely embarked on a journey to Brandenburg. For the Hohenzollern family, this was a high-stakes gamble they could not afford to lose. Should the Margraviate of Brandenburg welcome the Hohenzollerns? Can Brandenburg be revitalized?"

EDG_BRA_mission_4_9_title:0 "Permit the Spread of Hussitism"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_9_desc:0 "Sandomierz, one of the centers of Hussitism, chose Bolesław of Hohenzollern, a scion of our cadet branch who went abroad for training, as their Marshal. Our relationship with Bolesław has always been quite good, and he has privately expressed willingness to return to the rising House of Hohenzollern. However, his position and firm Hussite faith create a certain divide between us. If we wish to later influence Sandomierz, we must demonstrate our goodwill. Yet, the Roman Curia also looks down upon Brandenburg and the Hohenzollerns. Thus, accepting the spread of Hussite faith no longer seems an unacceptable matter. Moreover, the Hussites possess advanced military doctrine and fervent missionary zeal. If it benefits Hohenzollern rule, why not proceed?"

EDG_BRA_mission_4_11_title:0 "The Hohenzollerns of Poland"
EDG_BRA_mission_4_11_desc:0 "Most high-ranking Hussites in Sandomierz now believe in our sincerity. The Sandomierz Republic was founded to ensure Hussite influence wouldn't be erased and could spread. Faced with internal and external adversities, we have now achieved this: preserving Hussitism and spreading the faith. Through the relentless efforts of Bolesław of Hohenzollern and the Duke of Brandenburg, Sandomierz has the opportunity to become our protectorate. However, our acceptance of heretics will not go unnoticed by the Emperor."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_1_title:0 "The Sword's Cry"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_1_desc:0 "During the prolonged wars, the Margraviate of Brandenburg, due to its weak local military, became a playground for various bandits, armies, nobles, and even neighboring states. They slaughtered, plundered, and ravaged this land with impunity. With the advent of Hohenzollern rule, Frederick III firmly believed in the principle that "might stems from the edge of the sword." He introduced a focus on military development, and subsequent Hohenzollern rulers remained inseparable from the army. The Hohenzollern sword cries out from time to time."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_2_title:0 "The Frederick Line March Formation"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_2_desc:0 "After resolving the Brandenburg crisis, Frederick III realized that the army required sufficient discipline and firm resolve to maintain rule in Northern Germany, a region surrounded by wolves. He reformed the army's organization and, emulating ancient Roman legion tactics, developed the line march formation, greatly enhancing the military's capability for group combat."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_3_title:0 "Fierce Dispute"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_3_desc:0 "Following the completion of basic military reforms and the conquest of Prussia, the challenges facing the Hohenzollerns grew ever greater. A fierce dispute arose between the Monarchist faction led by the King and the Junker faction led by the Chancellor. The Junkers believed the army should be entrusted to well-trained mercenaries according to tradition, with most funds and resources invested in territorial development to ensure overall national preeminence. However, the Hohenzollern rulers were convinced that only by maintaining their own armed forces could they secure rule and gain more benefits."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_4_title:0 "§RExclusive Mission:§! The Iron Army"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_4_desc:0 "We followed the Monarchist faction's opinion. Under the Hohenzollern family's forceful push, the standing army would be composed of able-bodied young men. The monarch sought to forge the standing army into an invincible, iron-hard force. Hohenzollern rulers were accustomed to instilling honor and belief into the army in a quasi-religious manner. They implemented sweeping and radical reforms to the standing army, dedicating more resources to systematic military integration while employing harsh training to temper soldiers' will. Thus, the Hohenzollerns possessed an ever-victorious army."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_5_title:0 "The National Army"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_5_desc:0 "A nation lacking depth and natural defenses often relies on formidable military power to safeguard its interests—this holds especially true for Northern Germany, as repeatedly proven throughout history. For Hohenzollern-ruled territories, facing intense military pressure and a political environment encircled by powerful foes, the Hohenzollern family abandoned the diplomatic arts once practiced in Franconia, instead adhering to the principle that "might stems from the edge of the sword." Against all odds, they built a powerful standing army on barren lands. The rise of the House of Hohenzollern unquestionably validates this decision. Under Hohenzollern leadership, the entire nation is imbued with admiration for militarism. Yet, the Hohenzollerns also maintain a firm grip on the army. Successive Hohenzollern rulers are instilled with a truth: "The army is an invincible sword; one must firmly control the direction of its blade to master all." Some describe the Hohenzollern-ruled state as an army possessing a nation, with the army's commander being the true ruler. But we tell the world: we possess a national army—a completely disciplined, efficiently obedient, and resolutely undefeated force."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_6_title:0 "Modernized Training"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_6_desc:0 "Frederick I inherited the past ideology of strengthening the army and also advocated for learning the military systems of powerful empires of the time. He organized the army into combined arms forces of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, introducing coordinated cavalry-infantry tactics and formations like the goose-step, enhancing both weaponry and tactics, which significantly benefited subsequent operations. Furthermore, during Frederick I's reign, he oversaw "regular training emphasizing army flexibility and soldier quality," introduced military bands and the provost system into the army, reformed the war department by separating it from civil administration, promoted the integration of Junker nobles into the officer corps, rationally adjusted conscription service periods, and even regulated soldiers' facial hair length within the new army's discipline. Later, Frederick IV proposed an operational doctrine emphasizing offensive and highly mobile warfare. Supported by this doctrine, Zieten's Hussars (light cavalry) and Dragoons (mounted infantry) were greatly expanded, proving the superiority of highly mobile cavalry warfare at the Battle of Hohensitz. Additionally, after this, Prussia's conventional operational intent shifted more towards highly mobile flanking attacks and极力 avoiding attritional warfare.

EDG_BRA_mission_5_7_title:0 "Advance with High Morale, Never Turn Back"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_7_desc:0 "After modernizing our training, our army became the strongest and most fearsome in the German lands.

EDG_BRA_mission_5_8_desc:0 "Our army seems beyond challenge. The fame of the Hohenzollern-led forces is known from the Mediterranean to Cathay, none unaware.

EDG_BRA_mission_5_10_desc:0 "After reaching consensus with the burgher class, the Duke, together with the citizens, embarked on active construction for the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The Berlin region became the focal point of this effort. In this prolonged struggle, countless new ideas flooded in; innumerable people grasped the meaning of their existence, no longer wandering aimlessly about life's future. Everything is developing for the better—this is the benefit of the Hohenzollern family turning swords into plowshares with the people."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_11_title:0 "All Roads Lead to Berlin"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_11_desc:0 "As Berlin thrived with vitality and all things flourished, the region's poor road conditions hindered developmental momentum. Wheels sank into mire, unable to extricate themselves; horses struggled to move an inch in the mud. Previous rulers turned a blind eye, only collecting the taxes they demanded. But the Hohenzollern family had a longer view. With a wave of his hand, Frederick III began constructing unimpeded roads in the Berlin area to ensure Berlin's development remained unrestricted."

EDG_BRA_mission_5_12_title:0 "Seas Change into Mulberry Fields"
EDG_BRA_mission_5_12_desc:0 "The power of humanity is boundless. With an enlightened ruler and people actively aspiring for a better life, the vitality unleashed is also infinite.

Moreover, the Sanssouci Palace in the Berlin region is a luxurious retreat all nobles desire to visit.

EDG_string_start_BRA:0 "§YHistorical Background§!\nThe history of the Margraviate of §YBrandenburg§! has long been lamentable. With its barren soil, marshes, and dark forests, Brandenburg was never among the Holy Roman Empire's most fertile lands. Under the rule of the §YWittelsbach§! and §YLuxembourg§! dynasties, the region was treated merely as a source of quick revenue. For ages, the influence of the local nobility within Brandenburg was immense, and lawlessness was nearly ubiquitous: the area harbored many long-unchecked robber barons who sometimes even dared to directly attack the castles of nobles and rulers.\n\n§YRecent History§!\nThe Dukes of §YBrandenburg§!, who once held the prestigious title of Brandenburg §YElector§!, enjoyed an exceptional status. Yet successive Brandenburg rulers wavered due to political stances and faced constant fragmentation over inheritance issues. In 1411, Brandenburg Elector §MSigismund§! was elected King of the Romans and crowned §YHoly Roman Emperor§! in 1433. His realm encompassed §YHungary§! and §YBohemia§!, marking a zenith of power. However, Sigismund paid little heed to impoverished Brandenburg. After becoming King of Bohemia, he shifted his focus and energies to ruling Bohemia and Hungary. Even Brandenburg's §Yelectoral dignity§! was forcibly stripped and transferred to the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nThus, Brandenburg faded into obscurity, merely a dark pearl beside the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nNow, Emperor §MSigismund§! may die without an heir, and Brandenburg's nobles, resentful of his transfer of the electoral title, have seized the moment. Citing the death of §MHabsburg's§! §MAlbert II§! in battle, they have pressured the aged Sigismund to relinquish his posthumous claims to Brandenburg.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the §MHohenzollern§! family in distant §YFranconia§!, §MWilhelm von Hohenzollern§!, weary of Franconia's treacherous politics and his own diminishing power—a slow death by attrition—shrewdly recognized an opportunity. He proposed an offer that §YWürttemberg's§! lord, §MFrederick III§!, who fretted over control of Franconia, could hardly refuse. Wilhelm von Hohenzollern offered the wealth his family had accumulated over centuries, plus the allegiance of the still-prosperous Counties of §YAnsbach§! and §YBayreuth§! to the House of Habsburg upon the Duke of Franconia's death, ensuring Habsburg control over Franconia. In exchange, once the Habsburgs ascended the imperial throne, they would support and permit the transfer of the Duchy of Brandenburg to Hohenzollern rule.\n\nOn one side: the wealthy Counties of Ansbach and Bayreuth, accumulated treasure, and control over Franconia. On the other: the Duchy of Brandenburg, already confirmed as impossible to inherit peacefully, stripped of its electoral dignity, filled with unruly elements, and exceedingly poor.\n\nThe answer was clear. Count Frederick III of Württemberg accepted the terms, and a secret, undisclosable agreement was reached.\n\nThe fate of Brandenburg is poised to change with the potential arrival of the House of Hohenzollern."
