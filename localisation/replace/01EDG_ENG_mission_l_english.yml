EDG_ENG_mission_1_12_desc:0 "A certain French satirical novel depicted such a future: due to the king's deliberate neglect of rural development, British sausages contained only 26% meat, with the primary components of this portion being cartilage, heads, offal, scrap meat from deboning, and other by-products. The novel even derisively referred to British sausages as 'emulsified high-fat offal tubes' by the end. To prevent this from becoming reality, we must invest in the development of rural animal husbandry."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_13_title:0 "End Manorial System" # Abolish the Manorial System
EDG_ENG_mission_1_13_desc:0 "With the success of economic reforms, currency has completely replaced the barter system of former peasants in rural life. Urban expansion and commercial development have gradually eroded the nobility's monopoly over land, with feudal tenancy contracts being replaced by rent agreements. Let us continue to advance reforms and completely abolish the manorial system."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_14_title:0 "Self-Sufficient Agriculture"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_14_desc:0 "At last, we have succeeded. According to a report by the advisor appointed by His Majesty the King: the meat content of British sausages has risen to 75%. Our agricultural products not only meet domestic demand but even leave surplus for export to the continent. One day, the entire world will eat British sausages!"

EDG_ENG_mission_1_15_desc:0 "For a considerable period in the past, the wool industry of [Root.GetName] has been a crucial pillar of the economy, generating immense wealth for [Root.GetName]. However, over time, the wool trade faces increasingly severe challenges. The emerging cloth textile industry has gradually replaced wool weaving, becoming a more popular primary fabric. Some insightful individuals at our court suggest we focus on research and development attempts in major wool-producing provinces, aiming to improve our wool textile technology."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_19_title:0 "Deputize Anglo Lords" # Authorize Anglo Nobles to Lead Military Reforms
EDG_ENG_ENG_mission_1_19_desc:0 "There is a consensus among almost everyone: to meet upcoming challenges, England should advance military reforms domestically, and this motion has also been approved by the Privy Council. Currently, the monarch and court intend to authorize this task to the Anglo nobility, reforming the fief-based mercenary noble system we have long used, to adapt the military system to our growing wartime needs."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_20_title:0 "Reorder Fief Mercenaries" # Reorganize the Fief Mercenary System
EDG_ENG_mission_1_20_desc:0 "The origin of the fief mercenary system might not be as honorable as most imagine. Its fundamental reason for emergence lies in the Anglo nobles' fear of death and desire to avoid military service, preferring to pay large sums to hire wandering mercenary bands to fight in their stead. However, over time, this mercenary form of warfare gradually became a tradition among the Anglo nobility. Of course, this tradition has also brought many benefits, reducing noble casualties and captures, ensuring the stability of noble lineage. Let us improve the fief mercenary system, making it a sharper sword in our hands."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_21_title:0 "Restructure the Anglo Lords" # Optimize the Structure of Anglo Nobles
EDG_ENG_mission_1_21_desc:0 "After reorganizing the fief mercenary system, the structure of our Anglo nobility also requires optimization. Although initially, this faction originated from many nobles who feared death and sought to avoid military service by paying large sums to hire wandering mercenary bands to fight in their stead, over time, fresh blood has replenished the ranks of the Anglo nobility. Many capable mercenary commanders have emerged, grateful for the generous remuneration our country offers, willing to serve here. It is time to optimize the structure of the Anglo nobility, removing the incompetent and letting truly talented individuals lead the mercenary bands into battle."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_22_desc:0 "As time passes and battlefield experience accumulates, the fief mercenary reforms have yielded significant results. Facts have proven our military reforms successful. Now, let us roll out the reforms, comprehensively advancing fief mercenary reforms, allowing our nation's fief mercenary system to radiate even greater vitality and combat strength."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_23_desc:0 "Battle after battle, victory after victory, our armies traverse mountains of blades and seas of fire, singing amidst a hail of bullets. The battle-hardened Anglo elite army strikes fear into the enemy's heart. From one triumph to the next, there are no more voices of doubt; illustrious military achievements are the best proof."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_11_title:0 "Economic Foundation"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_11_desc:0 "Our ambitions know no bounds, our goals daunting to other nations. We need a full treasury to support our actions in Europe—a powerful national bank. We should prepare our government and economy for the introduction of a nationalized banking system.\n\nThe Bank of England was the world's first central bank established under state leadership. In the 15th century, to address Europe-wide shortages of precious metals and declining currency credibility, the king chartered the establishment of the Bank of England to raise funds for war and royal diplomatic activities. Over subsequent long development, the Bank of England gradually monopolized the nation's currency issuance rights, playing a significant role in the process of royal centralization."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_12_title:0 "Build Cities"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_12_desc:0 "The Greater London Metropolitan Area is England's primary base for handicrafts and economic core region, encompassing major cities such as Greater London, Gloucester, Hampshire, Oxford, Gloucester, and Hampshire. If money is likened to beer, when burgeoning trade fills London's cup to overflowing, the spillover froth also brings substantial development to surrounding cities."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_14_title:0 "Boost Cloth Production" # Encourage Cloth Production
EDG_ENG_mission_2_14_desc:0 "Around 1500, the British textile industry achieved primitive mechanization. The widespread use of water-powered fulling mills in water-rich areas like Yorkshire greatly enhanced our productivity. We should vigorously fund technological upgrades in the textile industry to gain more profits from cloth production."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_15_title:0 "The Spinning Jenny Prototype" # The Prototype of the Spinning Jenny
EDG_ENG_mission_2_15_desc:0 "A textile worker from Lancashire invented a new type of spinning machine, increasing the productivity of hand-operated spinning wheels to 4-5 times their previous level, significantly boosting labor productivity. To maintain our dominant position in the textile industry, it is necessary for us to promote the use of this machine."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_16_desc:0 "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.\n\n——Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities"

EDG_ENG_mission_2_18_title:0 "Mass Army Expansion" # Large-Scale Army Expansion
EDG_ENG_mission_2_18_desc:0 "To support England's external interventions and ambitions, a doctrine of a large standing army was advocated by the king. Only a larger, stronger army could protect England's interests. Guided by this large-army ideology, numerous barracks were established across England, and many young men were conscripted into camps for training. The sword of war was firmly gripped in the king's hand."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_19_title:0 "Deputize Norman Lords" # Authorize Norman Nobles to Lead Military Reforms

Currently, the monarch and court intend to authorize this task to the Norman nobility, reforming the standing royal army noble system we have long used, to adapt the military system to our growing wartime needs."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_20_title:0 "Reorder the Royal Army" # Reorganize the Standing Royal Army System
EDG_ENG_mission_2_20_desc:0 "The history of the standing royal army system is very long, not inferior at all to the fief mercenary system represented by the Anglo nobility. They mostly originate from the first Norman nobles who followed William the Conqueror to England. These Norman nobles are very traditional military aristocracy, firmly believing in the truth of 'winning the empire on horseback.' Compared to mercenaries, Norman nobles emphasize the formation and expansion of a standing royal army, believing that only a professional, standing noble army is trustworthy. Let us improve the standing royal army system, making it a sharper sword in our hands."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_21_title:0 "Restructure the Norman Lords" # Optimize the Structure of Norman Nobles
EDG_ENG_mission_2_21_desc:0 "After reorganizing the standing royal army system, England's Norman nobility also requires optimization. Although most members of the Norman nobility are traditional nobles who have secured their status through military achievements, each boasting illustrious battle records, as a noble group's membership and scale expand, inevitably, the wheat and chaff mix, and even some black sheep appear. We urgently need to optimize our Norman noble structure, removing those complacent incompetents resting on their ancestors' laurels, allowing truly capable individuals to realize their potential."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_12_title:0 "The Council in London"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_12_desc:0 "A considerable period has passed since the dreadful Three Baronial Wars. Through the diligent efforts of successive generations of the royal family, royal power has been largely restored, centralization is steadily advancing, and parliamentary power has been significantly constrained and regulated. However, increasing concerns have emerged in the minds of the monarch and other senior government officials. If in the future, a monarch as incompetent as John Lackland ascends the throne, might centralization instead bring disaster? Thus, the debate over whether the state should incline toward monarchical autocracy or parliamentary authorization has torn our nation apart. His Majesty the King has decided to convene a state council in London to discuss this issue. Regardless of the outcome, the council will put an end to this chaotic situation."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_13_title:0 "Bicameral Division"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_13_desc:0 "To balance the interests of the nobility and commoners, the British Parliament will be divided into the House of Lords, composed of nobles, and the House of Commons, composed of commoners, to check and balance each other. The Great Council splits into two houses: the House of Commons speaks for taxpayers, commoners, and petty bourgeoisie, while the House of Lords serves as the political institution for nobles and clergy. We must ensure the loyalty of both houses. This will ensure that when implementing policies, we always have a portion of supporters."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_14_title:0 "Royal College of Arms" # Establish the Royal College of Arms
EDG_ENG_mission_3_14_desc:0 "Initially, the College of Arms was a small government body for identifying and researching the art of heraldry. Over centuries of development, the College's power gradually expanded. The reformed Royal College of Arms is responsible for handling all matters concerning the nobility, including conferring lower noble titles, presiding over monarch coronations and state funerals, awarding medals with royal authorization, and verifying noble lineage."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_15_title:0 "[Root.GetName] Renaissance"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_15_desc:0 "The state, army, trade, and diplomacy are advancing rapidly; culture should be no exception. We should embrace and promote Renaissance ideas. The Renaissance has ushered in an era of science, art, and culture. If we vigorously fund and develop this endeavor, London will one day become the cultural center of all Europe."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_16_title:0 "Renovate Universities"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_16_desc:0 "Among historical institutions of higher learning such as Oxford and Cambridge, some facilities have become unsuitable for use. A modest investment should greatly improve this situation. We deeply realize that although universities were once institutions dominated by the Church to cultivate theological talent, primarily studying theological thought, with the generous patronage of His Majesty the King, state-funded universities have become cultural highlands for researching science and arts and expanding intellectual horizons. Let us continue advancing this endeavor; England will stand at the pinnacle of European technology!"

EDG_ENG_mission_3_17_title:0 "Focus Outward"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_17_desc:0 "England's rapid development, the pacification of East Anglia, East Midlands, York, and other regions, have restored the long-lost unity of England under the House of Plantagenet. Next, the king's gaze turns beyond Britain, while vigorously developing military technology. The dawn of early artillery has already appeared."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_19_title:0 "Normalize Militarization" # Normalization of Military Power
EDG_ENG_mission_3_19_desc:0 "To respond to the intricate international situation and all possible external threats, our military power should be normalized. We should vigorously develop the military industry, rebuild and maintain our standing army system, and strengthen our army training. Of course, Parliament views proposals for establishing a standing army with suspicion and fear. Yet recently, under the threat of internal and external wars, we ought to establish a standing army commanded personally by the monarch to defend our nation from enemy invasion."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_20_title:0 "A Military with a State" # Government Institutions Serving the Military
EDG_ENG_mission_3_20_desc:0 "The Ordnance Office system is used to provide ample supplies to the army during wartime, ensuring soldiers' pay; the Ministry of Land Development is needed in wartime to accommodate our professional soldiers, meet their living needs, and motivate their combat efforts. These government institutions all serve our military. In peacetime, they fully ensure people's livelihoods; in wartime, they must use all means to help us win the war."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_21_title:0 "Establishment of the Redcoats" # Pilot Establishment of the Redcoats
EDG_ENG_mission_3_21_desc:0 "With the advent of the new era, our extensive overseas territories require protection, and the potential conflicts abroad with other nations and local inhabitants increasingly demand a standing army. To safeguard England's international interests and territorial security, the Redcoats emerged. Most recruits for the Redcoats come from the lowest classes of British society. As is well known, military life is harsh with low pay, thus primarily attracting those living in poverty. Most soldiers sign lifetime contracts in exchange for a 'bounty'; the army's 'room and board' holds immense appeal for those in dire straits. We will conduct specialized training to better equip them for combat duties.\n\nAs for why they wear 'red coats,' this is mainly because battlefields are chaotic and disorienting, and soldiers might accidentally fire on friendly forces if not careful, which must be avoided at all costs. We should design a suitable, conspicuous uniform for the troops to significantly reduce friendly fire and improve military appearance."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_23_title:0 "The Renowned Redcoats"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_23_desc:0 "In 1645, Cromwell formed the New Model Army, whose soldiers uniformly wore red coats—the origin of England's famous Redcoats. This New Model Army implemented standardized uniforms, discipline, and organization, holding significant importance in British, and even world, military history. Some even regard it as Britain's establishment of the first regular army in history. Later, this Parliamentarian army was reorganized into the Royal Army, and the red uniforms were retained until the British army changed uniforms in 1902.\n\nFrom the 17th to the 19th centuries, these troops in conspicuous red clothing and tricorn hats almost became a distinctive symbol of Britain. They were well-equipped, well-trained, and demonstrated extremely high combat quality. When battles commenced, Redcoat soldiers would form neat squares, advancing steadily like an iron Great Wall. Their conspicuous red clothing shone like fire on the battlefield. Their red coats gleamed in the sunlight, symbolizing courage and determination—the red reaper on the battlefield.\n\nUndoubtedly, this was the world's strongest land army for nearly 300 years."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_11_title:0 "Superstructure"
EDG_ENG_mission_4_11_desc:0 "The ruler regards their absolute authority as divinely granted, yet central authority has constantly been challenged. Today, our Parliament still attempts to limit the authority of our esteemed monarch. The ideology of absolutism grows within European courts, and we are no exception; we must follow the trend and strengthen monarchical absolutism. His Majesty the King's centralization reforms have given our government greater influence, and an advanced government, in turn, injects vitality into our economy."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_13_title:0 "Imperial Court"
EDG_ENG_mission_4_13_desc:0 "The Privy Council of State initially served as an advisory department for the monarch.

EDG_ENG_mission_4_14_desc:0 "Since our state religion was established, some heretical adherents have stubbornly resisted, still following the commands of the so-called 'false pope' within their heretical religions underground. We should establish a comprehensive national church system to consolidate domestic faith, manage believers, and better propagate the authority of our religious leader. As our religious policies steadily advance, the religious divisions of centuries within our country are being repaired. Let us unite under the one true faith: one nation, one monarch, one faith!"

EDG_ENG_mission_5_12_desc:0 "For a long time, England's religious dilemma has deeply torn the entire nation. Although we preliminarily addressed this affliction after the last large-scale English religious crisis, the root of the suffering was not thoroughly eradicated; instead, it continues to affect us profoundly and enduringly. Religious chaos envelops Europe. Once, the Pope was our guiding light; now, only confusion remains. We must control the situation and decide our stance on theological matters. Protracted religious conflicts have plunged our faith into disorder. To resolve this issue, His Majesty the King has decided to convene a religious council at Canterbury to address this problem."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_13_title:0 "State Religion of [Root.GetName]" # The State Religion of [Root.GetName]
EDG_ENG_mission_5_13_desc:0 "On one hand, ever since we embraced Catholicism, we have followed the leadership of the Papacy. Some insist that Papal directives are unshakable, while others point out that the Papacy's corruption has become intolerable. The Pope always attempts to interfere in our politics through religious influence and even openly demands bribes from us; thus, our patience has reached its limit. Since many pioneers of the Reformation have raised the slogan 'justification by faith,' we can certainly act under the king's banner, not the Pope's. Finally, through the religious council at Canterbury, we ended the religious conflict. It is time for us to solidify our faith and usher in a new era of unity."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_15_title:0 "A [Root.GetAdjective] Papacy" # A Papacy Exclusive to [Root.GetName]
EDG_ENG_mission_5_15_desc:0 "We are a land personally blessed by the Lord. However, the clerical institution has vastly different ideas on handling religious affairs. We must ensure the nation's piety and maintain control over the Church. An extremely creative and practical idea has been proposed by insightful individuals at our court. As our influence in religious affairs grows, domestic clergy have gradually learned their place, no longer challenging the authority of His Majesty's government. It is time to go further. The King of England will no longer merely be a model and leader of the state religion but will be remembered as the head of the Church, God's plenipotentiary representative on earth."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_19_desc:0 "The navy is England's glorious service. The Royal Navy, as the oldest branch of the British armed forces, was first used by Alfred the Great as early as the 9th century, and by the early 14th century, the English navy was already participating in naval battles, making it one of the earliest recorded navies in history. The history of the modern Royal Navy can be traced back to the early 15th century. Because of this, the Royal Navy holds the most prestigious status among the three services, revered as the 'Senior Service,' deserving its unquestionable glory."
