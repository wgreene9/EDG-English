EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.1.t:0 "The Ownership of the Polish Crown"
EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.1.d:0 "As the Hussite Wars expanded, Jan Hus's ideas spread to southern Poland. Many minor nobles in Lesser Poland converted to Hussitism, believing it to be the truth people should follow. After the death of Władysław III, opportunistic converts exploited the power vacuum to overthrow the local magnates, seized control of Lesser Poland, and established a Hussite noble republic, with its highest institution called the 'Purification Committee.'\n\nThe Duke of Greater Poland, Siemomysł III, understood that Polish kings had spent the past century trying to centralize power, while the autonomy of Holy Roman Empire princes was growing. Thus, he wished to become a West Slavic imperial prince like Bohemia, which would not only avoid the threat of the Teutonic Order but also facilitate the infiltration of his influence into Pomerania. Therefore, Siemomysł III refused to submit to the distant court in Kraków, effectively gaining independence.\n\nThe split between northern and southern Poland also fostered separatist tendencies in the Duchy of Masovia. Consequently, the central court in Kraków effectively lost control over most of the country. The Piast rulers of Masovia were unable to quell domestic doubts, and the title of King of Poland became an unclaimed empty honor.\n\nNow, Poland's fragmented lands have all fallen into the hands of the Plantagenet dynasty. We should deliberate carefully to find the best future for the West Slavs."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] had a dream, a dream the House of Plantagenet had longed for across generations. In the dream, the Kingdom of England grew into an unparalleled powerful state: its fleets sailed every water across the five oceans, its armies marched on every land under the nine heavens; its subjects lived and worked in peace under its protection, its territories stretched from where the sun rises to where it sets. When people spoke of it, they thought only of strength and prosperity; it was the world's benchmark, civilization's beacon, the leader of all nations past, present, and future.\n\nAt dawn, [Root.Monarch.GetName] awoke from the dream. Gazing at the faint sunlight outside the window, [Root.Monarch.GetName] couldn't help but recall the midnight vision. That dream was so fantastical, yet so clear—because this is the present of the Kingdom of England, this is the today of the House of Plantagenet.\n\nThe wind rises on the River Thames, the tide ebbs in the Gulf of Suez. Every place under the gaze of the gods now belongs to us. We stumbled into motion amidst thorns and mud, watering with blood and sweat a utopia free from filth.\n\nThe autumn wind is chill as ever, but the world is transformed.

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.3.d:0 "Not all rulers are as benevolent as we are. In fact, most of the time, terror and cruelty are the impressions a strong leader should leave. If a minor ruler with insufficient national strength dons a mask of gentleness to cherish his reputation, his enemies will bare their fangs without hesitation, and his supporters will flee in doubt and fear to a stronger side. Since Frangleterre has also had its share of adversity, we generally show understanding to these local princes acting out of necessity.\n\nHowever, this time the subject seems to have crossed a line. Long before we conquered the Western world, horrifying tales about the Romanian ruler began to reach people's ears: it is said he is inherently cruel and extremely bloodthirsty, impaling everyone on sharpened stakes, even sparing not his own kin and friends; it is rumored he sold his soul, made a deal with the devil, becoming not only immortal and ageless but also invulnerable to weapons... Yet when [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before him, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found the legendary vampire lord was just an anemic-looking old man, nothing like the terrifying figure in the rumors. But this could also be his cunning disguise, waiting for the Plantagenet armies to let down their guard before the devil's thirsty fangs reappear in the world. What should we do?"

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.4.d:0 "The Turks were powerless to stop the armies of the Plantagenet dynasty. We easily crossed the straits and crushed all resistance in Anatolia. Amidst the chaos of war, a soldier found a peculiar book in a ruined tent. Though barely literate, he was greatly amused by the stories it contained and promptly handed it over to his sergeant. It eventually made its way to [Root.Monarch.GetName], with everyone along the chain assuring it was a worthwhile read.\n\nThe Emperor skeptically flipped through a few pages but was immediately captivated. The book recounted tales from another world where the Turks were brave, skilled in war, and remarkably clever. Not only could they shatter enemy walls, fragile as clay, with mythical cannons, but they also used dark magic to coax one king after another under their rule. They established a vast empire spanning three continents, where all infidels were as lambs to be manipulated, including the Magyars of the north and the Mamluks of the south. From the mid-15th century to the early 19th century, no adversary for the Turks could be found on the entire globe. The whole story was absurd and laughable, like the ravings of a madman or a drunkard, hardly something a sane person would produce. Yet the book's Nordic author swore a solemn oath that if a single word were false, he would immediately marry a goat!\n\nAfter laughing hysterically, [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to ponder the powerful Ottoman Turkey described in the book. [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that perhaps not all stories of this world were groundless; Frangleterre could surely learn something from it."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.5.d:0 "Historically, France developed a natural boundary based on geographical features and political considerations, known as the 'natural frontiers' or 'natural borders.' The south was bounded by the Pyrenees, the west by the Atlantic coast and bays. However, the eastern and northern borders were not entirely defined by natural geography, often shifting with the ebb and flow of power between the Paris court and German princes.\n\nRegrettably, France's former masters were always mired in various internal political struggles. They lacked the strength to command the overall situation and had no determination to be true rulers of a nation. They would rather eke out a living in the Paris court, catering obsequiously to their legal vassals, completely disregarding whether their subjects were threatened by infidels and foreigners.\n\nThese ambiguous boundaries remind us that as the new leader of the French region, the path forward for Frangleterre will not be hindered by any force. The unshackled Plantagenet dynasty will shatter the political framework carefully constructed by the German Emperor."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.6.d:0 "Every self-important ruler fancies themselves the chosen one, believing there must be some special reason they occupy their current position. Court historians exhaust themselves lavishly praising these childish monarchs, describing celestial omens at their birth and extraordinary actions in their youth, as if leading a nation were not the work of flesh and blood but some three-headed, six-armed monster—something any person of discernment would scoff at.\n\nWhat once stood in Frangleterre's way was a Holy Roman Empire composed of countless such absurd and ludicrous clowns. Rather than steadfastly developing the economy and arming the people, they preferred to squander internal unity in spittle-flying quarrels and determine superiority in village brawls as if playing house—truly laughable.\n\nIn the East, a martial artist taught people to be like water. Frangleterre deeply understands this wisdom. As the times change, we have now seized the pulse of destiny and stand atop the tide of history. The Plantagenet dynasty shall be as unstoppable as a flood. Let us become a giant wave sweeping across the world, washing away all the ghosts and goblins daring to block the path of our eastern campaign."

On this day, the court in Paris received an unusual young guest. She curled up like a small animal in a robe clearly not her own, curiously observing our illustrious court. Her trembling companion explained their destroyed homeland and exiled fate, vividly recounting the perils of crossing the continent and the narrow escape over the straits. Clearly, their harrowing journey moved many present; our courtiers expressed sympathy and pity for this princess of a fallen kingdom. Yet some raised doubts about their identity, believing this was merely an elaborate charade by two swindlers aiming to earn money or even steal our intelligence. As the arguments subsided, all eyes turned to the only decision-maker present, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. From the start, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had sat silently in [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] chair; no one knew what [Root.Monarch.GetName] was thinking.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed silently at the princess of unknown origin in the hall.

Though she maintained an appearance of cheerfulness daily, deep in her heart lay the unwilling grief of a destroyed nation and lost home. Especially when the old minister who had followed her all the way regretfully closed his eyes and was buried in a foreign land, the princess became perpetually melancholy, not a day passing without longing for her eastern homeland. And today, her nightmare could finally end.\n\nAs the armies of the Plantagenet dynasty escorted the former princess into Moscow's inner city, many elders wept with emotion, urging others to lay down their weapons. We obtained the crown of Moscow, and even the legitimate claim to the entire Slavic region, without lifting a finger. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that such long investment and waiting were worthwhile; a benevolent monarch had received [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] due reward.\n\nNow, the princess representing Eastern European power had gracefully knelt before us, offering the scepter of Moscow with both hands. We could politely decline, entrusting her to rule the harsh eastern lands in our stead; or accept with peace of mind, trusting the Slavic people would welcome our governance wholeheartedly. Or, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had another bold, unexpected, and perhaps unreasonable proposal that might lead our nation toward a new tomorrow."

Aiming to dissolve the stubborn resistance of traditional religious forces, we temporarily allowed diverse Christian doctrines to clamor freely at court, but today's discourse seemed a bit too peculiar.\n\n'Your Majesty,' the clergyman kneeling before [Root.Monarch.GetName] could barely contain his excited gasps, his trembling body groveling obsequiously on the ground, 'do you know? Our nation's destiny has arrived!'\n\n'The First Kingdom of the world was Assyria-Babylon, the Second Persia, the Third Greece, the Fourth Rome. The first three kingdoms perished due to idolatry, and the Fourth's successor, the Holy Roman Empire, is nearing its end.

Horrified, [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] mouth to cry for help, but despair thick as ink instantly flooded into [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] terrified mouth, crushing [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] eardrums through the ear canals, squeezing [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] dangling eyeballs from their sockets.

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.11.d:0 "Our Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a curious person, especially keen on collecting tales of the supernatural and bizarre, like a recent strange anecdote from Persia. According to our spies, in the distant east, in the Azerbaijani mountains, a group calling themselves the 'Red Heads' has appeared. They elected a descendant of a great figure as their leader, attracting followers with religious tenets deviating from the mainstream, and relying on force to move unchecked among Persian warlords. Yet their most remarkable trait is that the Safavid leader can not only attract those loyal to him but also summon those who oppose him. When he speaks, all neighboring rulers involuntarily offer various resources, as if hypnotized by some spell; nations daring to refuse suffer misfortune—social unrest and people's misery. While proclaiming divine guidance, the Safavids rely on inexplicable power to crush one formidable enemy after another, truly baffling.\n\nAfter hearing the report, [Root.Monarch.GetName] fell into deep thought. It seems they are not the 'Red Heads' [Root.Monarch.GetName] imagined (Irish horse thieves) but a rather mature political group.

According to the sweating archbishop's report, ever since Frangleterre's territory incorporated the Pearl of the Mediterranean, churches under our rule began to change one after another. Clergy shed their cassocks, discarded their scriptures, and instead lectured on worldly knowledge. Even the most devout old archbishop tore off his splendid vestments, picked up lecture notes, and began teaching the subjects he studied in his youth. Worse, we didn't even know how to handle this crisis. Drastic transformations occurred in churches nationwide; when parishioners arrived for worship or confession, they could only stare dumbfounded at the newly emerged universities before them. Just as people grew increasingly anxious, with some troublemakers even proclaiming the end of religion, all the strange changes suddenly ceased.

On March 21 of the same year, the Church, compelled to accept the appeal, declared their marriage invalid on grounds of 'consanguinity,' terminating this royal union. That year, Eleanor was thirty years old. She immediately set out to return to her fiefdom. Nearly every noble coveted this former Queen of France.\n\nAt the court of Aquitaine, Eleanor began selecting her next man. Henry came into her sight—young, handsome, already a duke. Eleanor promptly wrote a letter to Henry, advising him to come to Aquitaine as soon as possible to marry her.\n\nHenry understood perfectly what marrying Eleanor meant. Before her vast dowry, a dozen years' age difference was no issue. Moreover, in his family, it was normal for the wife to be older than the husband; Henry's own mother was eleven years older than his father. Therefore, upon receiving the letter, Henry immediately gave the reply Eleanor desired. To avoid alarming too many, Henry followed Eleanor's instructions and traveled to Aquitaine. On May 18, 1152, Henry, Duke of Normandy, secretly married Eleanor, twelve years his senior. This was only six weeks after Eleanor's divorce from Louis VII.\n\nNow, although the Duchy of Aquitaine has slipped from Plantagenet control, neighboring France and Arles both eye this southern French paradise covetously.

While the adults were busy arguing over neighboring wars, the two children held hands and had their own tea party. They chased and played in the garden, startling the little hounds into barking; they hid the cheese for the main course in the kitchen, giggling secretly at the flustered chef; they sang with their young, clear voices in the front hall, lay together sleeping on the soft little bed in the bedroom; they chatted, laughed, shared their worlds with each other, until the moment of parting. Reluctantly loosening their tightly held hands, they realized they hadn't even asked each other's names.\n\n'My name is Margaret, what's yours?'\n\n'My name is Bernadette.'\n\nThat was the sweetest sound Margaret had ever heard, as sweet as a rose blooming at dawn."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Sa.21.d:0 "It was a bright afternoon in Paris, the weather unbelievably fine. To fully enjoy the leisurely hours, [Root.Monarch.GetName] went alone to the garden, declining all company, greedily embracing the fresh air and gentle breeze.\n\nLately, the nation's troubles had been few; more and more people were expressing loyalty to the House of Plantagenet. Regardless of their past allegiances, Frangleterre's governance provided each person with a fitting place. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was confident that under [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] astute ruling strategies, any resisting force would eventually melt away like ice under the sun.\n\nJust as [Root.Monarch.GetName] was musing on Frangleterre's bright future while strolling slowly on the soft earth, an incongruous rustling suddenly came from behind. At first, [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought the source of the noise might be a family member playing a joke or a concerned attendant worried for [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] safety, but the heavy, rapidly approaching footsteps chilled [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] heart.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] whirled around to see an assassin, dagger in hand, lunging forward. There was no time to block or cry out; the sharp blade sliced through the air, aiming for [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] horrified face.\n\nSuddenly, a sword scabbard flew from afar, swift as an arrow from a bow, knocking the deadly weapon aside. Its owner gave the assassin no chance to recover; in the moment of the assassin's doubt and fear, the rescuer closed the distance and drove a sword through the assailant's chest. Only then did the shaken [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognize the savior: the foundling [Root.Monarch.GetName] had taken in fifteen years ago. Now grown into a graceful young woman, she had also mastered extraordinary skills.\n\nSilently, she bent to confirm the assassin's death, then immediately turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName], her eyes showing concern and inquiry. [Root.Monarch.GetName] steadied [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] nerves, reached out, and with a relieved smile, embraced [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] beloved daughter."
