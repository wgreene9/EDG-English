EDG_flavorLIA.1.t:0 "Royal Carriage Assassinated"
EDG_flavorLIA.1.d:0 "When a shadowy arrow flew into the carriage of the Liao King like a swarm of locusts, a piercing shriek immediately erupted. The cry was so shrill that it momentarily drowned out all the noise of the marketplace. As the second and third arrows chased like shooting stars from the taverns along the street, this silence transformed into a sudden, boiling panic...\n\nIn any case, the Liao King, appointed by the Yuan court, died on the streets of his own domain, without even having the chance to detail his final wishes—only murmuring a few words into the ear of his beloved adopted son.\n\nIn truth, this Liao King's fate had always been tragic. He was the uncle of the current Yuan Emperor, sharing the same father as the previous emperor, making him the most legitimate heir to the throne. However, because he was too young when his father passed away, his half-brother seized the throne. Although his brother promised him the perpetual ruling power over Liaodong, everyone knew it was merely an exile. Since the Zhizheng Disturbances, under the encroachment of the Jurchens and Koreans, the Yuan court had essentially lost control over the Liaoyang Province, maintaining only nominal rule over the Liaodong Peninsula and Dongning Prefecture. Jurchens, Han Chinese, and Koreans fought here, sharing power. The Liao King was merely a mascot for the court. He could only rely on supporting local Han Chinese to suppress the Jurchens and Koreans to maintain his rule. Though the Liao King was already in his thirties, he remained childless, having only adopted a son from a local gentry family. Now, with the Liao King's sudden death, undercurrents are growing more turbulent.\n\nThe Liao King's adopted son captured the Jurchen archer in the tavern, quickly took control of the situation, and claimed that the Liao King's will passed the throne to him. The assassination shocked the court and the nation; imperial investigators would surely arrive soon. Now, all of Liaodong is abuzz with discussions of this event, and clouds of conspiracy loom over the mountains and seas."

EDG_flavorLIA.1.b:0 "We shall obey the court's authority"
EDG_flavorLIA.2.t:0 "Pacifying the People"
EDG_flavorLIA.2.d:0 "Through our interrogation, the Jurchen involved in the assassination quickly confessed. He was a fallen Jurchen nobleman. He admitted to deliberately assassinating the Liao King, explaining that it was precisely because the late Liao King favored the Han Chinese and suppressed the Jurchens that, despite his talents, he could find no opportunity to apply them. In poverty and resentment, he resolved to assassinate the Liao King to achieve true Jurchen control over this fertile land.\n\nBut is it really that simple? When we pressed him on whether he was acting under orders, he consistently denied it. In truth, Liaodong's situation has never been secure. A century ago, during the Zhizheng Disturbances, the Jurchens and Koreans already took advantage of the Yuan court's weakness to infiltrate Liaodong, and they have always harbored ambitions to dominate the entire region. Their shadow may be behind this incident, though we lack concrete evidence.\n\nBut that is not what matters; what matters is the Yuan court's stance. The court has long sensed threats from the empire's northeast and the fragility of the tributary relationships. The court also hopes to deter these frontier barbarians through actions and expand its influence here. If handled properly, we might secure the court's support and strengthen our power.\n\nFor now, however, Liaodong is filled with rumors and panic. The urgent task is to pacify the bewildered people and stabilize our rule."
EDG_flavorLIA.2.a:0 "This must be the work of external forces! We must seek revenge!"
EDG_flavorLIA.2.b:0 "This is merely an unfortunate incident; what matters now is maintaining peace on our borders."
EDG_flavorLIA.3.t:0 "The Yuan Court's Decision"
EDG_flavorLIA.3.d:0 "The Liao King's envoy presented before the throne the circumstances of the late Liao King's assassination and the current Liao King's stance, accompanied by the captured assassin and several pieces of evidence and witnesses. All of this pointed to one conclusion: the barbarians in the empire's northeast are growing increasingly disobedient to imperial authority, and they played a role in escalating this incident. Therefore, the court must punish these disloyal vassals to uphold the Celestial Empire's prestige.\n\nThe court plunged into a prolonged and heated debate. Ultimately, under the Empress Dowager and the Chancellor's decision, the court resolved to temporarily sever ties with the Jurchens and Koreans until they come to court to apologize. As for further actions, disagreements remained. Most ministers believed the Liao King should be given appropriate support to balance the situation in Liaoyang, but others opposed aiding the new Liao King, citing the empire's financial state and fears that he might nurture rebels to strengthen his own position.\n\nRegardless, we must take action in the empire's northeast; otherwise, those barbarians will surely forget the empire's existence and majesty."
EDG_flavorLIA.3.a:0 "Grant the Liao King military supplies and provisions, and order him to eradicate the evildoers!"
EDG_flavorLIA.3.b:0 "A small show of force to intimidate those barbarians will suffice."

EDG_flavorLIA.4.t:0 "Royal Decree to Subdue the Barbarians"
EDG_flavorLIA.4.d:0 "When the emperor's personally endorsed edict to quell the rebels reached Liaodong, the entire region erupted in celebration. Cartloads of supplies, provisions, gold, and jewels were dispatched by the Yuan court to the Liaodong frontier. Spectators along the route buzzed with discussion, their faces beaming with joy. Everyone knew the court was determined to punish those barbarians who had long stirred trouble on the borders and were likely involved in the Liao King's assassination.\n\nThe resonant sound of war drums and horns traveled from the banks of the Liao River, echoing through the frontier garrison camps and piercing into the mountains and forests where the Jurchens and Koreans hid. A chilling aura of impending conflict settled over the land. That night, some rejoiced, others wore frowns of worry, and still others harbored ambitious schemes. The chain of events triggered by the Liao King's death had brought the situation to a boiling point. And we, with arrows already nocked on the bowstring, were resolved to shoot down the Celestial Wolf."
EDG_flavorLIA.4.a:0 "By royal decree, all provinces and counties shall muster their troops, raise righteous armies, and cleanse the land of these vile scourges!"
EDG_flavorLIA.5.t:0 "The Lone Army of the North"
EDG_flavorLIA.5.d:0 "There was no further action; the court handled the matter with only a light touch. We received neither justice nor any substantive assistance. Perhaps the court saw no benefit in investing vast sums of silver into this remote wilderness, or perhaps they merely wished to watch from the sidelines, waiting for the opportune moment to intervene and reap the greatest gains.\n\nClearly, for now, we can only rely on ourselves to repel foreign aggression. Otherwise, our farmlands and homes will be burned, our wives and children taken captive, our honor and dignity trampled underfoot. We have no retreat left; all we can do is grip our sharpened blades tightly and shatter every enemy that dares invade our territory."
EDG_flavorLIA.5.a:0 "We are utterly isolated and without aid. Draw your blades, and face the enemy!"
EDG_flavorLIA.6.t:0 "Liaodong's Plea to the Throne"
EDG_flavorLIA.6.d:0 "Recent court discussions have centered on one matter. Several days ago, an official from the Liao King's retinue delivered a letter to the court. In it, the Liao King earnestly detailed the dire straits now facing Liaodong—the encroachment from Jurchens in the north and Koreans in the south had left the royal territory perilously vulnerable. Despicable foreigners continued to ravage our people, and Liaodong desperately needed further reinforcements from the court.\n\nAmidst the clamorous debate and impassioned sentiments, whether genuine or feigned, the court found itself with little choice. The ministers and high officials all concurred: only by responding to public sentiment, showing compassion for the people, and punishing the enemy's crimes could they uphold the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nThe Son of Heaven nodded, and the edict was issued forthwith. Silver and grain were to be allocated for military use, the Liao King was specially authorized to expand his guard to counter border threats, and he was granted the authority to act as he saw fit."
EDG_flavorLIA.6.a:0 "Order the allocation of annual provisions to support the frontier armies!"
EDG_flavorLIA.7.t:0 "Imperial Reinforcements"
EDG_flavorLIA.7.d:0 "Our persistent efforts at court have borne fruit! Through the persuasion of courtiers friendly to our cause, the court has resolved to send us reinforcements. In addition to increased annual provisions and waived tribute payments, we are permitted to raise a larger army. This promises a brighter future for us!"
EDG_flavorLIA.7.a:0 "Today Liaoyang rejoices, a city of song and light through the night!"

EDG_flavorLIA.8.t:0 "The Lingering Dream of Guzhu"
EDG_flavorLIA.8.d:0 "After the fall of the Yin altars, Boyi and Shuqi starved on Shouyang Mountain to preserve their purity, while Jizi fled to Joseon, spreading civilization among the distant tribes, only to be overthrown by the Wei. Later, Emperor Wu of Han commanded a punitive expedition, establishing four commanderies, incorporating them into the royal domain. Following the Han's demise, Liaodong became a forsaken land, mixed with the stench of barbarism, until the Tang dynasty. With the destruction of Goguryeo, imperial prestige extended among the barbarians, establishing tributary relations to control the frontiers, which continued until our present dynasty.\n\nHateful barbarian chieftains, having received territory from the Son of Heaven to shepherd their people, remained deaf to civilizing influence and ungrateful for heavenly grace. Instead, they repeatedly launched violent campaigns, plundering our populace, and harboring treacherous ambitions to usurp our ancient lands. Displeased, the Son of Heaven thus ordered a punitive expedition. The royal armies marched to punish their crimes, to halt their invasions and plunder. To kill without first teaching would be tyranny; thus their ranks were stripped, and education was enforced in their stead.\n\nNow the six armies have marched forth, reaching far to Hanyang. Along the way, fallen corpses lie exposed, wives and children traded for food—each harrowing scene a testament to the villainy of these bandits. Pity our multitudes, who offer food and drink from their meager stores, like water flowing downhill—none act otherwise. Seizing this victorious momentum, we press forward in one concerted effort, to crush their strongholds, execute their chieftains, and win the people's hearts.\n\nThe merit of this campaign, a feat for the ages, expands our territory by a thousand li, eternally upholding the royal mandate. Carve it in stone to commemorate this grand achievement."
EDG_flavorLIA.8.a:0 "The transformative power of illustrious virtue shall forever bless your kind."
EDG_flavorLIA.9.t:0 "Recasting the Mandate of Heaven"
EDG_flavorLIA.9.d:0 "Our ancestors came from the steppes under the stars, seizing this prosperous land with the edge of their blades. Yet no empire is eternal; even the Mandate of Heaven can decay. Under the long grind of time, our empire collapsed in thunderous ruin.\n\nBut courage and glory never fade. In the past, when the Former Han lost its tripods, chaos erupted across the land. Yet Emperor Guangwu arose from obscurity, ultimately pacifying the realm and renewing the Han's Mandate for another two centuries. Today, facing towering citadels and overlooking the relics of bygone dynasties, a surge of heroic spirit fills our hearts—we have reenacted the deeds of our forefathers.\n\nThe eaves of the palaces in Dadu already bear the hue of age, countless nights having silently passed within their great halls. Yet, a new sun is rising, one that will dispel the cold and darkness of the long night."
EDG_flavorLIA.9.a:0 "The phoenix rises from ashes, the empire dawns anew."

EDG_flavorLIA.10.t:0 "Retrial of the Liao King Case"
EDG_flavorLIA.10.d:0 "Since the assassination of the old Liao King twenty years ago, our nation has weathered many storms. Fortunately, our great monarch, Yuan, led us through the thorns and guided us toward a bright future.\n\nHowever, Shenyang City has been uneasy lately. Whispers spread that the mastermind behind the Liao King's death over two decades ago was none other than the Liao King's adopted son, Yuan, and that the old Liao King's posthumous son has now returned. He seeks to reclaim his father's kingdom and execute the regicidal villain—some dismiss this with scorn, others fall into deep silence and doubt…\n\nThe entire city of Shenyang is shrouded in an indescribably eerie atmosphere. Amidst the swirling undercurrents, the court has plunged into fierce debate over how to handle this exceedingly thorny issue."

Jurchen cavalry, accompanied by the biting north wind, are advancing through the snow! The Jurchens secretly resent the new Liao King for framing them and ruthlessly expelling them, unwilling to relinquish the warm and fertile plains of the Liao River. They are determined to seize the land they desire by force. This perpetually turbulent land is about to be shrouded once more in the gloom of upheaval…"
