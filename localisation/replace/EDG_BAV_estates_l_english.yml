estate_edg_artists: "Artists"
estate_edg_artists_desc: "Artists serve the glory of the state with brushes, chisels, and strings. They move between court and common folk, shaping the monarch's image with frescoes and epics, uniting the people's hearts with drama and hymns, and immortalizing victory and faith through architecture and sculpture. Artists do not directly produce grain or forge cannons, yet they transform intangible prestige into visible order: proclaiming legitimacy in grand ceremonies, pacifying discontent in turbulent times, and displaying civilization and wealth before foreign lands.\n\nHowever, inspiration requires patronage, and reputation craves a stage. If neglected, they may turn to satire and critique, letting rumors spread faster than paintings; if treated generously, they can weave a brilliant halo for the state, wielding cultural influence far beyond the reach of the sword."
