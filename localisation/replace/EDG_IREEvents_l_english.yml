EDG_IREEvents.0.desc:0 "In the twelfth century, King Henry II of England invaded Ireland and successfully ruled the entire island, proclaiming himself the Grand Duke of Ireland. He strengthened the feudal system in Ireland, giving it a central administrative structure for the first time, and ultimately passed the title to Richard the Lionheart. After Richard's death, Ireland was inherited by his nephew Arthur, but following Arthur's murder by John, Ireland descended into chaos, and the Plantagenet dynasty completely lost control over Ireland.\n\nDuring this turbulent period, an Irish general claiming descent from Cormac mac Airt, Patrick Art, used Ulster as his base. Within two years, he unified all of Ireland after two centuries of confusion, controlled the Grand Duchy of Ireland, and was elected as the Grand Duke of Ireland by various social classes.\n\nTo maintain Ireland's fragile feudal system, Patrick compromised with feudal lords across Ireland, granting local nobles greater autonomy in exchange for their support. Simultaneously, Patrick vigorously sought Papal support, promising to reform the corrupt state of the Irish Church, thereby securing the opportunity to be crowned as the High King of the Kingdom of Ireland.\n\nFrom a national perspective, Patrick nominally unified Ireland and successfully ascended as king. However, in terms of actual governance, the nascent Kingdom of Ireland was merely a fragile confederation. Domestic great nobles enjoyed extremely high autonomy, leaving the monarch with limited mobilizable power, preventing Patrick from fundamentally breaking free from these great nobles.\n\nAs Patrick's reforms advanced, the great nobles grew increasingly dissatisfied with this young High King, setting the stage for a full-scale rebellion that would sweep across all of Ireland."

EDG_IREEvents.2.name:0 "Patrick mac Airt"
EDG_IREEvents.2.desc:0 "After Richard the Lionheart's death, his nephew Arthur inherited the title of Duke of Ireland. However, with Arthur's murder by John Lackland in 1203, and as local great nobles grew dissatisfied with John's rule, they ultimately rose in rebellion in 1204, causing the Plantagenet dynasty to completely lose control over Ireland.\n\nWhile the Irish people celebrated their liberation from England, they soon realized they had not escaped hardship. After losing upper-class rule, the great nobles attempted to establish independent states within their domains, leading to endless internecine warfare and slaughter. The Emerald Isle once again plunged into endless chaos.\n\nFor a long time, as both Scotland and the Kingdom of England focused on each other, Ireland remained largely untouched by either, maintaining its fragmented state since 1204. For two centuries, Ireland was never substantially unified by any power.\n\nBy 1440, a mysterious figure, claiming descent from Cormac mac Airt, the 20-year-old Patrick mac Airt seized control of a castle in Ulster that year. With the support of surrounding village peasants and city mayors, he proclaimed himself Earl of Ulster, using this as a base to begin his plan to unify Ireland.\n\nBecause Patrick largely preserved the rights of great nobles in newly conquered territories, combined with his own military talent, he encountered almost no obstacles during his conquest of central Ireland. Within just two years, he unified nearly the entire island of Ireland. By the end of 1442, the last remaining ruling class entrenched in southern Ireland swore fealty to Patrick, allowing Patrick to formally obtain the title of Grand Duke of Ireland in early 1443.\n\nSince Patrick's unification relied heavily on compromise regarding the privileges of various great nobles, Ireland's system resembled a confederation, and Patrick needed to change this. Therefore, in 1443, Patrick began courting the Pope, promising to reform the conservative Insular Christian Church in exchange for the Pope crowning Patrick as High King of Ireland.\n\nAlthough Patrick's reign has been brief so far, he can be considered a wise ruler for this period. During Ireland's unification, he issued decrees reducing national taxes and prevented several potential famines by actively mobilizing possible domestic and foreign resources. Patrick frequently visited various cities and villages to understand the living conditions of Ireland's lower classes, formulating various possible policies based on the current situation to alleviate the pressure on the common people. Patrick often proposed policies bolder than his intended outcomes, such as completely exempting a region from taxes for a year—such policies were obviously unacceptable to any noble. However, because the starting point of negotiations was set higher than the target, after negotiations, Patrick, with his exceptional eloquence and charismatic persuasiveness, always achieved his expected goals to advance his vision.\n\nFor the above reasons, Patrick enjoys extremely high prestige among the populace. Bards across Ireland continuously sing of Patrick's legendary deeds, praising and extolling him as one of the greatest kings in Irish history, bestowing upon him the title—'the Unifier'."

EDG_IREEvents.3.name:0 "Kingdom of Ireland"
EDG_IREEvents.3.desc:0 "By consolidating the legitimacy of his authority through religion, Patrick began reforming the various privileges of the internal great nobility. Patrick was well-versed in diplomacy, maneuvering among the nobles, using persuasion, advice, or threats and inducements to advance the centralization of power in Ireland. However, these reforms, operating near the lower limits of what the great nobles could tolerate, also steadily eroded their patience with Patrick. It is foreseeable that a turmoil sweeping across all of Ireland will soon occur.\n\nInternal issues might not be as simple as they appear. While a rebellion by the great nobles is neither novel nor excessively severe, an even more fatal problem for Ireland stems from Patrick himself. Patrick's impression on his subjects is that of a diligent ruler—he has almost no so-called rest time, or rather, his rest involves handling some affairs, which he enjoys. Many worry that Patrick will succumb to overwork, but he disregards such concerns, continuing his rule.\n\nSuch a charismatic and powerful figure naturally attracts female attention, yet Patrick seems uninterested. He has rejected all possible marriage proposals and shows no inclination to marry. This deeply concerns the various factions loyal to Patrick and those wishing to ensure the Kingdom of Ireland's continued rule. If Patrick has no offspring to inherit his throne, the consequences are self-evident—no one else possesses the prestige and ability to inherit the title of High King of the Kingdom of Ireland. Should Patrick pass away, the Kingdom of Ireland would fragment once more.\n\nHowever, internal issues are not the only concerns for the Kingdom of Ireland. Scotland has welcomed its young and ambitious King Alexander IV, a monarch whose aspirations will not tolerate a unified Ireland threatening his ambition to unite the entire British Isles. Although the English king is gradually declining due to recent disasters, prosperous England is far more powerful than impoverished Ireland. Even under such circumstances, Ireland is no match for England.\n\nWhile Patrick does not display his ambitions and aspirations as overtly as the Scottish King Alexander IV, he is by no means indifferent to unifying the British Isles. In Patrick's heart, the British Isles will belong to Ireland, and he will revive the island's most ancient and elegant name."

EDG_IREEvents.12.name:0 "The Lollard Commission"
EDG_IREEvents.12.desc:0 "The Lollards were followers of Wycliffe in late medieval England. This derogatory term originates from Middle Dutch, meaning 'mutterers,' and was earlier used for European groups suspected of heresy. In 14th-century England, the Church was the largest feudal ruling class, controlling about one-third of the land. It not only exploited English peasants through rents and forced labor but also drained the blood of the faithful through heavy taxes and the shameless sale of fake saintly relics.\n\nThe corruption, decadence, and extortion of the Catholic Church not only deepened people's hatred for the clergy but also ignited national consciousness, pushing the anti-clerical sentiments long present in English society into a new phase in the 14th century. The conflict between royal authority and the Papacy grew increasingly severe. Throughout the 14th century, Parliament passed a series of statutes opposing Papal interference in English internal affairs. Meanwhile, the nobility, the lower-ranking knights, and the emerging townsfolk found increasingly common ground. They were filled with envy and resentment towards the abbots living corrupt lives while wielding state power. Clearly, the old feudal theological worldview could no longer satisfy this new generation.\n\nThe common people at the bottom, suffering under dual oppression from both Church and secular authorities, were the most susceptible to joining such anti-Church movements. In the 14th century, English theologian John Wycliffe launched a fierce assault against the Roman Catholic Church, heralding the beginning of the European Reformation. Moreover, as the reform deepened, Wycliffe's proposals for church reform gained strong support from knights, commoners, and the emerging bourgeoisie. Driven by the needs of their own social strata, they enthusiastically joined this religious reform movement. These people were scornfully labeled 'Lollards,' deemed heretics.\n\nThe first Lollards centered around Wycliffe's colleagues at Oxford University, led by Nicholas of Hereford. In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury forced some Oxford Lollards to recant their views, but the sect continued to expand. A Lollard uprising in 1414 was swiftly defeated by the King of England.\n\nThe uprising was met with brutal reprisals. However, due to the overall decline and turmoil within the Catholic world, it did not mark the end of the Lollards' open political influence. Increasing numbers of common people and preachers began openly or secretly embracing Lollardy, gradually slipping beyond the control of the English rulers. By 1444, large numbers of adherents in southern England had converted to Lollardy. In East Anglia, their own Lollard Church had been established, breaking away from the control of the Roman Curia. The rulers of East Anglia also upheld Lollard doctrine as their guiding principle, establishing a Lollard Commission subordinate to the Duke to manage the local Lollard faithful and provide support for the ruler.\n\nNow we have conquered the rulers of these lands, and we must consider how to deal with the still deeply entrenched organization of the Lollard Commission."

EDG_IREEvents.13.desc:0 "Around the early 10th century BC, the Celts first appeared in the upper reaches of the Seine and Loire rivers in eastern France, and the upper Rhine and Danube rivers in southwestern Germany, which are also considered the birthplace of their culture. In the following centuries, the Celts, organized into armed tribal alliances, spread, migrated, and conducted military settlements into surrounding regions.\n\nAs the first people in Europe to learn to make and use iron and gold ornaments, the Celts easily defeated various tribes still in the Bronze Age, and by the 7th century BC, they had settled across eastern and central France.\n\nBeginning around 500 BC, the Celts advanced from mainland Europe to the British Isles, forming what would become Irish and Scottish cultures. In 387 BC and 279 BC, the Celts invaded and sacked Rome and Greece respectively. Some tribes even penetrated as far as Anatolia in modern-day Turkey. At their peak, the Celts occupied vast territories from Portugal to the Black Sea, nearly rivaling the later Roman Empire. Yet, regrettably, this was never unified into a single cohesive state.\n\nWith the rise of Roman civilization, Celtic culture began to decline. Facing Roman armies organized with strict discipline and advanced tactics, even the tall and fiercely courageous Celts gradually found themselves at a disadvantage. In 385 BC, the Celts sacked Rome—a painful memory long held by the Romans. It was not until Julius Caesar's decisive victories over the Gaulish Celts from 59 to 49 BC that Roman honor was avenged.\n\nGaul, the heartland of Celtic culture, subsequently became a Roman province. As Roman legions campaigned far and wide, Celtic culture gradually vanished from mainland Europe, absorbed bit by bit into Roman culture. Only in Ireland, which Rome never reached, and in Scotland, which Rome never truly conquered, did Celtic culture persist.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes invaded the British Isles. Though the Celts rose in resistance, they ultimately faded gradually into the long river of history...\n\nUntil $YEAR$, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName] has finally unified the descendants of the ancient Celts scattered across the British Isles. After a period of cultural fusion and development, a broader cultural concept has gradually emerged—this is what is called 'Greater Celticism.'\n\nCoinciding with the rise of the Celtic-founded nation of [Root.GetName], the tenets of 'Greater Celticism' align perfectly with the nation's ascent: Britain should be a land of the Celts.

However, over the past century, with the rise of the Celtic peoples on the British Isles, numerous social factors have hindered their full revival. Greater Celticism has gradually captured public attention, fueling a desire to strengthen Celtic nationalism and build a more advanced nation-state. In the process of Celtic revival, the power of the domestic bourgeoisie has also grown. The bourgeoisie demanded to break free from the shackles of feudal theological thought and called for religious reform. The spread of Renaissance and Reformation ideas further heightened anti-clerical sentiments across all social strata. Meanwhile, the increasingly powerful monarchy sought to cast off the constraints of papal authority.
