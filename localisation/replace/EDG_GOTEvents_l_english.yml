EDG_flavor_got.1.desc:0 "In the past, Gotland existed as one of Europe's few peasant republics, similar to Dithmarschen, and maintained its independence for a long time until it was captured and controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark in 1361.\n\nIn 1439, considering external factors, the then King of Denmark, Eric XIII, moved to reside on the island of Gotland. After Eric's defeat in the Danish Confederacy uprising, he became the Duke of Pomerania and pledged to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, hoping for his assistance in restoring Danish royal authority and willing to make the Kingdom of Denmark part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSigismund was unable to help Eric at that time, but this inadvertently provided a solution for the Danish Confederacy. To prevent the Empire from attacking itself and to gain imperial protection against the threat from Sweden, the Danish Confederacy proposed to Emperor Sigismund to join the Holy Roman Empire. After receiving approval, it became part of the Holy Roman Empire and obtained many privileges to counterbalance the Hanseatic League's expansion in the northern part of the Empire.\n\nAlthough Eric currently serves as the Duke of Pomerania, he remains unwilling to abandon his claim to the Danish throne. Therefore, until 1444, he continues to reside in Gotland Castle, awaiting the day he can reclaim the Danish crown.\n\nHowever, for the people of Gotland, they do not welcome the rule of this former Danish king over the city. The memories of the Visby Massacre in 1361 and the subsequent tyranny are still vivid, making Eric's rule on Gotland precarious.\n\nSweden's covetous gaze could at any moment lead to Gotland facing the flames of war once again. Regardless of what countermeasures Eric might take, the people of Gotland will inevitably be plunged into dire straits once more. The lower classes urgently hope to break free from the current situation—by any means necessary."

EDG_GOTEvents.0.name:0 "Störtebeker and the Victual Brothers"
EDG_GOTEvents.0.desc:0 "Claus Störtebeker was born in 1382, and little is known about his early years. Some say he was a farm boy from Wismar, whose parents were serfs working for the manor lord. Others claim he was the illegitimate son of a noble, and yet others say he was actually a knight. However, none of this is important, as his later legendary career would become the most remarkable part.\n\nIn 1388, the then Swedish King, Albert III, clashed with the nobility. His political opponents elected Margaret as regent over the parts of Sweden they controlled and promised to assist her in conquering the remaining Swedish territories. A combined army of Danish and Swedish nobles went to war against Albert. When Stockholm was besieged and suffering from famine, Albert III's father, Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg, recruited guerrilla fighters and initiated a privateering war against Danish merchant ships. Among them was a fleet that carried out several bold operations, successfully breaking through the Danish blockade and managing to provide food to Sweden. They thus called themselves the "Victual Brothers."\n\nDue to their success against the Danish fleet, Duke Albert II continued to employ the Victual Brothers as privateers to disrupt Danish trade. They became state-sponsored pirates and were even able to sell their plunder in the markets of Rostock and Wismar.\n\nHowever, this prosperity did not last long. A few years later, Stockholm was captured, and Albert III was forced to abandon his claim to the Swedish throne. This led to the Victual Brothers losing their "legal" privateering license. But the Victual Brothers had anticipated this situation and were prepared. In 1394, they swiftly captured the island of Gotland and used it as a base to plunder and wreak havoc across the Baltic Sea.\n\nIn 1398, Claus Störtebeker officially became a member of the Victual Brothers and participated in their raids. Though young, he performed excellently, showing bravery and wisdom, and quickly gained fame. However, their plundering activities in the Baltic Sea soon attracted the attention of the Teutonic Order. As Störtebeker severely disrupted the Teutonic Order's trade, Grand Master Konrad von Jungingen sent nearly a hundred warships and about four thousand soldiers to attack Gotland that same year. Within less than a month, they captured the island and destroyed the Victual Brothers' stronghold there."

EDG_GOTEvents.1.desc:0 "During the Battle of Gotland, the leader of the Victual Brothers was captured and quickly executed. At this time, Claus Störtebeker organized the remaining pirate members and managed to escape during the extermination campaign.\n\nHe soon became the leader of the Victual Brothers and found a new foothold in East Frisia. The local mayors welcomed them with open arms, providing them sanctuary. Thus, the scattered Victual Brothers established a new base here and offered protection to the local cities. In the following years, Claus Störtebeker and his members, adopting the motto 'God's friends and the enemies of the whole world'—a phrase later engraved on the base of the Störtebeker monument—roamed the North Sea, amassing rich plunder, which they divided equally. They then set their sights on maritime trade with England.\n\nHoping for abundant spoils, they waited for Hanseatic cogs at the mouths of the Elbe and Weser rivers, particularly targeting ships from Hamburg and Bremen, plundering them extensively. Gradually, they grew and formed a new alliance, causing significant disruption to trade in the North Sea and Baltic regions. By 1400, Margaret I, the regent queen of the Kalmar Union, which had unified the Scandinavian crowns, allied with the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen, intending to completely crush the Victual Brothers. Thus, the situation in the North Sea slowly grew tense.\n\nIn 1401, the Hanseatic League assembled armies and ships, conducting several military operations on East Frisian territory, forcing the mayors to pledge no longer to harbor Victual Brothers members. In 1402, a fierce battle erupted between the Hanseatic fleet and the pirate fleet near Heligoland. The main mast of the pirate ship was shattered by cannon fire from the Hanseatic flagship.\n\nDuring this naval battle, a spy from the Hanseatic League attempted to destroy Störtebeker's rudder with molten lead to capture the privateer ship, but the act was discovered in time, allowing Störtebeker to escape. However, both the Hanseatic fleet and the Victual Brothers suffered heavy losses in this battle, and the raiding activities of Störtebeker's Victual Brothers significantly decreased.\n\nOver time, the Victual Brothers gradually recovered their strength, and Störtebeker's raids became more frequent. In 1429, King Eric of Denmark established the Sound Toll, leading to open war with the Hanseatic League. Thus, Eric hired the Victual Brothers, led by the Hanseatic League's old adversary Störtebeker, hoping they would destroy the Hanseatic League's trade stations in the North Sea. Störtebeker gladly accepted this client's request and completely destroyed the Hanseatic League's trade station in Bergen that same year.\n\nHowever, what Eric did not anticipate was that this raid not only destroyed the entire trade station but also burned down a large half of Bergen's urban area. This subjected Eric to pressure from the Norwegian parliament, forcing him to abandon his contract with Störtebeker."

EDG_GOTEvents.2.name:0 "The Fate of Gotland"
EDG_GOTEvents.2.desc:0 "Störtebeker likely anticipated Eric's breach of contract and quickly seized the opportunity to begin indiscriminately plundering ships from both Denmark and the Hanseatic League, shifting his focus closer to the Baltic region. As both Denmark and the Hanseatic League were preoccupied with containing each other, neither actively pursued Störtebeker's Victual Brothers, allowing them to once again raise the black sail in the Baltic Sea.\n\nIt was not until the outbreak of the Danish civic movement in 1439 that Eric was forced to take refuge on Gotland. As relations between the Danish Confederacy and the Hanseatic League improved, the Victual Brothers soon became a common threat to both the nascent Danish Confederacy and the Hanseatic League.\n\nIn 1443, a fierce battle erupted between the Victual Brothers and the combined fleets of the Hanseatic League and the Danish Confederacy in the Danish straits. As in 1402, Störtebeker repelled the Hanseatic and Danish Confederacy fleets, but he also lost the sanctuary of cities in northern Germany. However, unlike thirty years earlier, Claus Störtebeker was now 62 years old, and his physical condition had greatly declined. Moreover, due to the continuous suppression by the Hanseatic League and the Danish Confederacy, the Victual Brothers' situation grew increasingly difficult.\n\nThus, at the end of 1444, Claus Störtebeker turned his gaze to the place where his pirate career began forty years earlier—Gotland. The Victual Brothers could now only make a desperate gamble. Under Claus Störtebeker's leadership, they set sail for this isolated Baltic island to contend with Eric, the former King of Denmark, who was of similar age, for control over this solitary isle.\n\nGotland stands at a crossroads on its journey, and its fate will be revealed at this moment..."
