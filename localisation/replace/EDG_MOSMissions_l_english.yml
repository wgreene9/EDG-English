EDG_MOS_mission_1_1_title:0 "Muster the Armies"
EDG_MOS_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Muscovy lies in a precarious position, flanked by the mounted hordes of the Uzbeks and Bulgars to the east, the rising roar of the Swedish Lion to the west, the ambitious Kyivan principalities and the stubbornly persistent Great Horde to the south. Before us looms the formidable Prince of Tver. With enemies so numerous and our diplomatic situation so dire, if our Grand Duchy is to survive the coming centuries, we must strengthen our military forces. This is necessary not only to counter future threats but also to face the formidable enemy at our gates."

EDG_MOS_mission_1_3_desc:0 "In the conflict with the Grand Prince of Tver, Grand Prince [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Moscow has reforged the mantle of authority across northeastern Rus', successfully resolving the succession crisis of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. Although full recovery from the upheaval will take considerable time, it is undeniable that the Grand Duchy of Moscow has reached its strongest point in a century; the cause of uniting all Rus' under Moscow burns with fierce intensity. To better consolidate our gains, we must further expand our armies to safeguard Muscovy's national interests."

EDG_MOS_mission_2_2_title:0 "The Northern Territories"
EDG_MOS_mission_2_2_desc:0 "For centuries, the Veche of Novgorod the Great has resisted bowing to any power, be it the savage Mongol tribes or the entrenched boyars. Nothing could break Novgorod. Yet now, the once-proud republic has fallen into decline. A food crisis and a spirit of capitulation have spread through the northern land, bringing it to a desperate end. It has even adorned itself as a kingdom no different from other Rus' principalities, electing a pitiful puppet king who trembles between the princes of the east and the Vikings of the west. Now, let us put an end to this obstinate republic and seize the legacy of Alexander Nevsky."

EDG_MOS_mission_3_1_title:0 "Estate Support"
EDG_MOS_mission_3_1_desc:0 "Although Grand Prince [Root.Monarch.GetName] dreams of a future claiming the throne of the Grand Prince of Vladimir, the support from Moscow's estates for pursuing the war of succession appears ambivalent. The boyars, the patriarch, and the veche stand like towering trees spanning the Rus' land and sky; their power and domains are the sprawling roots among the principalities. Whichever prince ascends the throne, they remain entrenched in power, making royal authority difficult to enforce. Fortunately, they prioritize petty gains over grand principles. If we grant them sufficient privileges to appease them, they will willingly serve as Moscow's lackeys in its expansion."

EDG_MOS_mission_3_3_title:0 "Unite Northeast Rus'" # Unite Northeastern Rus'
EDG_MOS_mission_3_3_desc:0 "Northeastern Rus' was once fragmented into several small and weak principalities, none worthy of the title Grand Prince of Vladimir. Now, by God's grace, the great [Root.Monarch.GetName], Tsar and Autocrat of Moscow, Vladimir, and Novgorod, Lord of Pskov and Nizhny Novgorod, Prince of Tver, Karelia, and Vyatka, Sovereign of Ryazan, Yaroslavl, Beloozero, Rostov and all the Northern Domains, has united Northeastern Rus' under the banner of Greater Moscow. Whether boyar or holy church, whether veche or freeman, all must bow before the august name of the Grand Sovereign [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe], blessed by the glorious triune God. Greater Moscow is the undisputed ruler of Northeastern Rus'!"

EDG_MOS_mission_4_1_title:0 "End the Civil War"
EDG_MOS_mission_4_1_desc:0 "Since the era of Yaroslav the Wise, the order of succession has been a fine political tradition of Rus'. Yet Vasily of Tver, driven by selfish desire, knowingly violated this by designating his son Mikhail as successor, plunging northeastern Rus' into civil war. Initially, Moscow seized the initiative, putting Tver at a disadvantage. However, with the unexpected illness and death of Grand Prince Rostislav, the positions of Moscow and Tver were suddenly reversed. Nevertheless, as the legitimate heir of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality, Moscow will never yield. Grand Prince [Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead us to victory!"

EDG_MOS_mission_4_2_title:0 "The Eastern Territories"
EDG_MOS_mission_4_2_desc:0 "The Muscovite territories of Vologda in the east have recently been contested by the despicable Novgorodians and the Tver branch's puppet claimants. As a result, we can no longer easily obtain furs or reopen the Ural trade routes, plunging the principality's economy into decline. While our brave Grand Prince courageously holds the line against the Tatars, where are Novgorod's profit-driven merchants and Tver's cunning princes? For both profit and glory, the Grand Duchy must reclaim its ancestral lands. Let all who covet them know there can be only one prince in Rus'—the Grand Prince of Greater Moscow, [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"

EDG_MOS_mission_5_1_title:0 "Expand Moscow"
EDG_MOS_mission_5_1_desc:0 "A nation's ambition to expand its territory must be supported by internal prosperity and strength. From the moment of its birth, the great city of Moscow was destined to be extraordinary. The bold spirit of the Moskva River flows into the land of Moskva, the gentle springs of the Yauza River nourish the diligent people, the solemn bells of the Kremlin inspire the Rurikid warriors, and the banner of Saint George proclaims the Grand Prince's majesty. Rus' has been dominated by countless outsiders throughout history, but everything will be reversed from this moment onward—Greater Moscow is the greatest of all Rus' principalities, and Grand Prince [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the sole sovereign of Rus'. To achieve this grand aspiration, Moskva, protected by the Sword of Saint George, must become the heart of all Rus', surpassing even Kyiv!"

EDG_MOS_mission_5_3_title:0 "Press the Advantage"
EDG_MOS_mission_5_3_desc:0 "Ryazan has always existed on the fringes of Rus' legitimate order. Its people are the obsequious, faithful servants of the Khanate, tainted by Tatar barbaric customs and bloodlines. In recent years, the Prince of Ryazan has further colluded with the Tatar herdsmen of Kasim, causing no end of trouble for Moscow's Rurikid dynasty. Although they can no longer threaten us following our victory in the northeastern Rus' civil war, the continued survival of these misbegotten spawn is itself an affront to Greater Moscow! The principle of knowing when to stop does not apply here. The Rus' believe only in might. Grand Prince [Root.Monarch.GetName] must not rest on the laurels of present victory but must press the advantage, punishing the Principality of Ryazan with fire and sword!"
