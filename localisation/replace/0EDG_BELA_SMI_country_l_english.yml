EDG_BELA_SMI_events.1.t:0 "Sápmi Society"
EDG_BELA_SMI_events.1.d:0 "The foundation of Sápmi society is the hunting and fishing Sámi people, which results in extremely low productivity and a sparse population. The Sámi organize into small tribes based on kinship to cope with nature. However, due to the production of precious furs, the Rus, Swedes, and Norwegians all wish to spread their religions in this land and levy fur taxes on the Sámi. Historically, the Rus, Sweden, and Norway have not clearly defined the ownership of the Sámi lands among themselves. Yet, broadly speaking, a resolution is imminent—with the decline of Novgorod and Sweden's increasing control over Norway, Sweden is gradually taking control of this territory. Unless we form our own state before that and formally clarify our lands with the surrounding nations, whether by submitting to them for protection or asserting our rightful claims to the land."
EDG_BELA_SMI_events.1A:0 "The foundation of our future state should be merchants and burghers."
EDG_BELA_SMI_events_1A_tt:0 "If, after completing §YEstablish the Sámi Religion§!, §YOrganize the Sámi Military§!, and §YRecord Sámi History§!, our §YLegitimacy§! is below §Y50§!, we will transition to a §YRepublic§!."

EDG_BELA_SMI_events.2.t:0 "Establish the Sámi Religion"
EDG_BELA_SMI_events.2.d:0 "The primal shamanistic religion of Sápmi is gradually declining, being replaced by Christianity from the southern civilized peoples. The Norwegians have sent bishops to us, the Swedes have proselytized to our southern kin, and the Rus have spread their Orthodoxy to us through trade in Kola. We must determine a religion to serve as our faith, uniting our people."
