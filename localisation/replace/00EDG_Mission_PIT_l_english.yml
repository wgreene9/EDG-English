EDG_mission_PIT_1_1_title:0 "§MDiplomatic Path§!" # The Diplomatic Path
EDG_mission_PIT_1_1_desc:0 "We are 'heretics', without a doubt. On one hand, our Cathar faith leaves us isolated in Northern Italy, the heartland of Catholicism; on the other hand, it also means we can form an alliance with the Kingdom of Arles to the west. But the Occitanians of Arles... are they truly trustworthy? Perhaps..."

EDG_mission_PIT_1_2_title:0 "§MReliance on the Court§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_2_desc:0 "Under the threat of the Italian states, allying with the Occitanians is clearly our only way out for now."

EDG_mission_PIT_1_3_title:0 "§MLeading the League§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_3_desc:0 "The Cathars have always been a minority, both within the Holy Empire and in France, but we will prove with strength and faith in whose hands the truth lies. Now is the time to unite all Cathar believers!"

EDG_mission_PIT_1_5_title:0 "Strategic Direction"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_5_desc:0 "To attack or to defend, that is the question. It is akin to debating whether Jesus Christ possessed more divinity or more humanity—no one can reach a definitive conclusion. But just as we have interpreted the Cathar faith for ourselves, we too shall make our own choice between offensive and defensive tactics."

EDG_mission_PIT_1_6_title:0 "The Alpine Barrier"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_6_desc:0 "The Alps are impassable? Since ancient times, whether it was Carthage or Rome, even the Gauls have crossed this mountain barrier, which is neither too high nor too low, countless times. Yet the purpose of this natural fortification is not to be impregnable, but to slow the enemy's advance, buying us time for our own actions."

EDG_mission_PIT_1_8_title:0 "The Renaissance"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_8_desc:0 "As the spring breeze of the Renaissance sweeps across the lands of Italy, we too must keep pace with the liberation of thought, allowing spirit and art to achieve perfect harmony within our very being."

EDG_mission_PIT_1_10_title:0 "Legal Reforms"
EDG_mission_PIT_1_10_desc:0 "The legal system is a crucial part of the Renaissance, and as pioneers of the Renaissance, it is only natural for us to ensure the perfection of our legal institutions."

EDG_mission_PIT_2_2_title:0 "§MIndependent Autonomy§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_2_desc:0 "Even though the Occitanians share our faith, they are ultimately not children of Italy. This so-called 'cooperation' with Arles is merely a pretense for them to further infiltrate and control us. Rather than be overthrown by schemes and plots, we would rather fight in the sunlight!"

EDG_mission_PIT_2_4_title:0 "§YMilitary Independence§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_4_desc:0 "Mercenaries, city guards, skirmishers... the wars of Northern Italy have given birth to countless military models, but what Piedmont needs most is an army truly of its own."

EDG_mission_PIT_2_5_title:0 "§YDeepening Reforms§!" # Deepening Military Reforms
EDG_mission_PIT_2_5_desc:0 "Swords, spears, and halberds are but cold weapons; it is living men who truly wield them. There is no inherent superiority among weapons, but the minds that command them are clearly distinguished."

EDG_mission_PIT_2_6_title:0 "§YThe Allobroges Legion§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_6_desc:0 "The Allobroges, who dwelled in Occitania and southern Switzerland, were once symbols of 'loyalty' and 'bravery'. These mercenaries would fight for their general to the last drop of blood, earning praise even from Caesar himself. And now, following the ancient ways of these warriors, we shall show our enemies what it truly means to be 'Gaulish Pike Mercenaries'!"

EDG_mission_PIT_2_7_title:0 "§YThe Sword of John the Baptist§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_7_desc:0 "'I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.'"

EDG_mission_PIT_2_8_title:0 "City of Pride"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_8_desc:0 "Oh, the Venaria Palace... a testament to the toil and wisdom of countless Piedmontese, a palace of devout faith worthy of pious belief, a city of splendor..."

EDG_mission_PIT_2_9_title:0 "Public Culture"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_9_desc:0 "A key aspect of the Renaissance lies in the construction of a 'public consciousness'. Now, we are not merely children of God, nor merely children of Italy, but Piedmontese, united under the same banner, sharing a common ideal."

EDG_mission_PIT_2_10_title:0 "Educational Reforms"
EDG_mission_PIT_2_10_desc:0 "The Renaissance is the vanguard of thought, and education is the driving force behind the Renaissance. When ideas burst forth, the guidance of teachers is also indispensable."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_1_title:0 "The National Defense Force" # Establishing the National Defense Force
EDG_mission_PIT_3_1_desc:0 "As one of the states of Northern Italy, mercenaries hold significant sway within our lands as well, but our Cathar faith has rendered all this to naught. Now, if we wish to defend Piedmont, we can only rely on ourselves."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_2_title:0 "Inevitable Confrontation"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_2_desc:0 "Our history with the Savoy family of Genoa runs deep. In the past, it was the Duke of Genoa who brought about our current tragedy, and now we are determined to thoroughly cleanse this disgrace!"

EDG_mission_PIT_3_3_title:0 "The Genoese Family"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_3_desc:0 "As an established mercantile family from the Toulouse-Occitania region, the Genoese family holds considerable influence throughout southern France and Genoa. Establishing friendly relations and cooperation with them is bound to bring us countless trade opportunities. However, the awkward truth is that the Genoese are French, and no one knows if they will ultimately betray us Italians..."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_4_title:0 "Integrating Sardinia"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_4_desc:0 "The Sardinians were once loyal partners of Piedmont, but when we were besieged and pursued by neighboring states, the Sardinians abandoned us, acting as cowards. Now that we have reclaimed the Sardinian region once more, it is time to put these past grievances to rest for good."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_5_title:0 "The Face of Saint Lucca"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_5_desc:0 "The city of Lucca was fortunate to preserve the legal spirit of the classical era through the dark Italian wars. The effective operation of the Luccan Signoria will undoubtedly enhance our governance. However, if we select these excellent politicians into our government, a power vacuum will once again emerge in Lucca itself."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_7_title:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_7_desc:0 "Amidst internal troubles and external threats, the life of the Piedmontese is not easy. Our living space in the Liguria region continues to shrink, and even the Sardinians, our sole trading partners, are beginning to waver. In such a precarious situation, hesitation will surely doom our future."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_8_title:0 "§YThe Garibaldi Reforms§!"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_8_desc:0 "The era of Italy's old-style mercenaries and city-state guards is over. As cannons are rolled out and smoke fills the battlefield, the times have quietly changed."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_10_title:0 "Military Reforms"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_10_desc:0 "The army is not the most important thing for a state, but for us, it is the way of survival. The symphony of guns and artillery... this is the way of future warfare."

EDG_mission_PIT_3_11_title:0 "Modernization Reforms"
EDG_mission_PIT_3_11_desc:0 "From the initial spark of Piedmont choosing to convert to the Cathar faith, to the unification of Lombardy and Liguria, and to the liberation of the Eternal City, we have experienced much. We are Piedmontese, but beyond that, we are, first and foremost, Italians."

EDG_mission_PIT_4_2_title:0 "San Giovanni Church"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_2_desc:0 "The Church of Saluzzo has long been subordinated to the surrounding Cathar authorities, yet it has stubbornly clung to the faith of the Roman Papacy. After a prolonged confrontation, the Bishop of Saluzzo finally succumbed, surrendering Saluzzo's wealth to us."

EDG_mission_PIT_4_4_title:0 "Greater Piedmont"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_4_desc:0 "Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria—when the true faith descends upon these three crowns, the map of Greater Piedmont will be realized. By God's grace, my eyes have already witnessed that glory..."

EDG_mission_PIT_4_5_title:0 "Lombardy-Venetia"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_5_desc:0 "The influence of the Catholic Church in the Lombardy-Venetia region has always been a problem. When we were still confined under the Alps, we were powerless against these ferocious entities. Now, the tables have turned. These bishops, colluding with merchants, can no longer escape their destined punishment."

EDG_mission_PIT_4_6_title:0 "Invading Tuscany"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_6_desc:0 "Tuscany has always been the Roman Papacy's most loyal defender and the lamb that has strayed the furthest. Is it not what the Cathar faith advocates to guide the lost back to the true path? Now Tuscany is within our grasp, and Rome... Rome is right before our eyes!"

EDG_mission_PIT_4_7_title:0 "The Eternal City"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_7_desc:0 "Rome, the Eternal City, we have arrived!"

EDG_mission_PIT_4_8_title:0 "Liberating Naples"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_8_desc:0 "And in the south, in Naples, it remains defiled..."

EDG_mission_PIT_4_9_title:0 "Manifest Destiny"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_9_desc:0 "Italy, once considered merely a geopolitical concept, has now truly become a reality... Italy, Rome... Greece. Is this not also a terrestrial trinity of the Heavenly Kingdom?"

EDG_mission_PIT_4_10_title:0 "Land Reform"
EDG_mission_PIT_4_10_desc:0 "The land of Italy was fragmented and occupied by feudal lords during the Middle Ages, which has posed a significant obstacle to implementing our new policies. If we wish to advance further reforms, we must redraw the lines of land ownership."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_1_title:0 "San Michele Church"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_1_desc:0 "Nizza, the final bastion of Catholicism within our realm, maintained a degree of autonomy due to various conflicts of interest. Now that the dust has settled, the autonomous bishop of Nizza has finally returned authority to us."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_2_title:0 "San Francesco Church"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_2_desc:0 "The bishop of the Monferrato region was the most stubborn faction in Piedmont. To resist the Cathar threat, the bishop even sold himself to the Duke of Lombardy, willingly serving the hypocritical monarch. However, when Lombardy's iron fist could no longer protect Monferrato, all the prayers in the world proved futile..."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_3_title:0 "Piedmontese Church"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_3_desc:0 "The Piedmontese Church has long occupied a very awkward position. As Cathars, the bishops of Piedmont were ostracized throughout Northern Italy; furthermore, their friendly relations with the Occitanians led the regional bishops of Saluzzo and Monferrato to rebel against the Cathar faith. Regardless, the past is behind us. Now that the Piedmont region is finally unified, it is time to look forward!"

EDG_mission_PIT_5_5_title:0 "Romagna-Emilia"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_5_desc:0 "The Archbishop of Romagna bears the name of Rome but practices acts of betrayal. The city of Rome may still offer them refuge, but the power of faith will ultimately defeat all these petty men."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_6_title:0 "Fated Adversary"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_6_desc:0 "For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:\nThey have spoken against me with a lying tongue.\nThey compassed me about also with words of hatred;\nand fought against me without a cause.\nFor my love they are my adversaries:\nbut I give myself unto prayer.\nAnd they have rewarded me evil for good,\nand hatred for my love."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_8_title:0 "Cleansing St. Peter's Basilica"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_8_desc:0 "Within St. Peter's Basilica, holy light shines forth..."

EDG_mission_PIT_5_10_title:0 "Parliamentary Reform"
EDG_mission_PIT_5_10_desc:0 "As the administrative center of Italy, Rome's capacity has reached its limit. Under the erosion of time, the foundations of the old era can no longer bear the weight of the new, and we must devise a new solution for this."
