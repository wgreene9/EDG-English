EDG_string_start_AK2:0 "In the southwest of Persia, at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410, the Mesopotamian Christian Church severed all ties with the churches of Antioch and the "West." Thereafter, the Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the Patriarch of the Eastern Church, assumed leadership and primacy over the Assyrian Church of the East. Although diverging from both Rome and New Rome, this did not mean Eastern Christians became rootless flowers; on the contrary, local Christians took root and flourished in the fertile land of Mesopotamia. To distinguish themselves from the Arabs present there, and certainly to distance themselves from the Babylonians of history who created the Babylonian Captivity, they called themselves Assyrians—though this did not imply any genuine connection to the long-buried Assyrian Empire in historical archives. Nominally, their masters were the Turkic conquerors. After the Turks arrived in Mesopotamia, these steppe pastoralists swiftly adapted from a horse-riding people to a riverine civilization. Along the Tigris and Euphrates, there were no shortage of Turkic converts to Christianity, guided by bishops to receive collective baptism in the Euphrates. As the Ilkhanate crumbled, these Christianized Turks first obeyed the Jalayirids who held Baghdad, then overthrew their employers of different faith, establishing the Christian realm of the Red Sheep Dynasty.\nWith the grand edifice of the Timurid Empire collapsing, the Red Sheep Dynasty, rising from the ruins of the Jalayirid Sultanate, swiftly drove into the power vacuum, firmly controlling the vast territories east of Baghdad. Meanwhile, the ancient Nestorian communities on the Mesopotamian plains endured relentless expulsion and brutal persecution from Muslim forces. In the heartland of Persia, among the scattered Turkic tribes, the Islamic faith had become the absolute majority. Faced with this undeniable force, it is clear that to bring them under our banner or turn them to our purposes, strategic respect—however thin as spring ice and destined to be only a temporary expedient—is indispensable."

The cold, gilded throne chafes their unease; their gaze sweeps over the labyrinthine streets below—where countless Muslim eyes smolder silently in the shadows. A phantom dilemma grips the new ruler's throat: To raise an iron fist, sweeping the infidels and their mosques alike out of their ancestors' city gates? This thought, like touching a fuse, instantly conjures visions of signal fires on the Persian plateau, Anatolian scimitars, and the wrathful howls of the Syrian desert seeming to press at the walls; the flames of vengeful jihad could reduce this fragile Nestorian kingdom to ashes. Or, to lift the Gospel, letting missionaries sow the seeds of the 'Eastern Light' in the narrow alleys of Muslim quarters? Yet, faith-walls forged over centuries stand firm as bedrock; gentle preaching before deep-seated hostility might be like water dripping into sand, more likely perceived as an invitation born of cowardice, allowing venomous snakes lying in wait to grow fangs beneath the sleeve. Survival, or faith? The cold scepter turns in sweat-dampened hands, each choice like inching along a tightrope over an abyss, beneath which rages an all-consuming fire of belief."

Every piece of Christ's wealth reclaimed from the infidels passed through his hands back to the court of the King of Kings, and his caravans brought Egyptian wheat, Iranian silk, and Caucasian beer back to this desolate camp—he could be considered half an insider. As for the third, still engrossed in calculations...\n'Hey, Greek, the loot this time is all stuffed into the storerooms. Same as usual—you go take inventory.' Manuchehr 'Samson' walked over to the robed cleric, grabbed a wooden cup of wine, and wet his throat with this fine brew from Cyprus.\nKonstantinos Polytropos, originally an Eastern Orthodox monk from Greece, had suffered misfortune, been captured, sold into slavery, and eventually ended up in Manuchehr 'Samson's' possession.

Manuchehr 'Samson' was accustomed to the Greek's reticence during work and lay back on his bed, sinking into a heavy rest.\nWhen Manuchehr 'Samson' awoke again, Polytropos was nowhere to be seen. Only Hotak stood quietly by his bed, holding a splendid scroll bearing a seal all too familiar to him.\n'My lord, the King of Kings has issued a new divine decree from his court in the mountains...'

The nomads of these wilds were greedy fairies, accursed djinn, arrogantly roaming the wilderness beyond the cities, plundering unwary merchant caravans clean. He had tried to imitate them, sending light cavalry deep into the steppe to raid the nomads' livestock in return. But the result was often nine failures out of ten attempts; once, they were even held for ransom, extorted for several wagonloads of grain.\nAfter that, Alborz 'Solomon' became, on the surface, a coward huddled in the city. By day he governed; by night he invited the nomadic chieftains to lavish feasts, with revelry day and night. He had heard many rumors spreading in the court of the King of Kings.

The King's stubborn old steward sought to suppress the slender puppet, but through its wisdom and schemes, the King discovered the truth, expelled the wicked old steward, and the puppet became a governor beloved by the local populace.\nAt the story's conclusion, the puppeteer made all the puppets bow to Rahman.

A powerless stray dog can do no great deeds. The only ones we need to guard against are the twin princes, far removed from it all.' Rahman produced a map from his robes and began carefully partitioning the lands of the sacred empire. 'Kara Iskandar lied to us all.

Since he could not grasp the opportunity, it falls to me to save her.'"

Hotak roared in his grand tent at Herat. 'We once served together under the King of Kings to expel the unbelievers and infidels, to let the glory of the true faith and the Cross banner honor all the lands of the Fifth Monarchy. Yet you have defiled all that is sacred with your schemes!'\nAccompanying the proclamation's spread across the land was the self-arming of various princes and governors. All trade routes that once centered on Tehran, the heart of Iran, were severed. Caravans were forced to halt where they stood, awaiting further developments.\n'You have committed the most unforgivable crime—not only murdering the God-blessed King of Kings, but stealing the throne belonging solely to God's chosen representative!' Within the high fortress of Tabriz, Jafar and ministers still loyal to the King of Kings gathered, urgently mobilizing armies still loyal to the King's Mandate and their own private forces.\nThe twin princes of the Iranian Empire also reacted. The armies of Manuchehr 'Samson' and Alborz 'Solomon' wrapped themselves in the red and black colors of lamenting heinous crimes to the Almighty Lord. Gnashing curses and the clashing of blades filled the air.\n'If none across the empire are willing to stand against such evil, then Manuchehr 'Samson' and his legions shall march on Tehran, using blades to cleanse the land of its defilement—'\nMesopotamia, the Caucasus, Fars, Transoxiana... Whether clerics, Ghulam nobles, Turks, or nomads, all held their breath, waiting for the first to draw his sword.\n'Even if the cost is that no land remains peaceful, only the crossing of swords, the toppling of mountains, the reversal of rivers!'\nIn the room that once belonged to the King of Kings, Rahman nearly tore to shreds what the man before him had presented. But he restrained the impulse and demanded in a venomous tone, 'Is this the "gentleman's agreement" your master speaks of? I think he would gladly see everyone gang up to finish me off!'\nThe envoy, clad in coarse linen robes, remained taciturn in the face of Rahman's almost palpable disgust, merely resuming the interrupted topic: 'Hotak assures you his armies will not set foot in the regions you substantially control. His planned campaign is primarily aimed at other restless forces, and I have already detailed for you who those are.'\n'The nobles of Fars, the clerics of Baghdad, the Ghulam of the Caucasus, the Turkic nomads of the steppe, the twin princes' armies on the borders, and the remnants holed up in Tabriz. Your master suggests these, rather than his own forces—which are no less formidable than the lion army Manuchehr 'Samson' trained in India—are the true threats to Iran?' Rahman's disdain nearly tore through his shrewd face, seeming to swallow the envoy whole.\n'You and the Governor act only for the throne of the King of Kings. But those I mentioned are secessionists who would carve out territories without hesitation given the chance, showing reverence neither to God nor protection to man.' The envoy's expression finally shifted, a subtle, meaningful smile appearing as if recalling something. 'The great task for both of you is to save Sacred Iran, even if it means shedding the most sacred blood, is it not?' Rahman's mind, nearly addled by the denunciation proclamation, finally calmed. He took a deep breath, then scribbled randomly on the paper before him, sealed it haphazardly, and threw it at the linen-robed cleric."

And after Saint Peter's martyrdom, Saint Paul built upon that first cornerstone the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, universal and transmitted from the Apostles.\n\nOur King of Kings, though the supreme leader of the Fifth Monarchy, is not the divine Son possessing supernatural power. Therefore, Kara Iskandar made covenants with various individuals on his journey to spread the true faith:\n\nHe made a covenant with the Church that also spreads the true faith, granting the land of the two great rivers to the clergy.\nHe made a covenant with the tribes who also ride horses, granting the vast pastures of lush grass to the Turkic tribes.\nHe made a covenant with the nobles who also govern others, granting the ancient hill lands embraced by broad coasts to the old lineages.\nHe made a covenant with the slave soldiers who also slay the infidel, granting the lands among the towering mountains to the Ghulam.\nThe King of Kings of the Fifth Monarchy made covenants with all his subjects. The subjects demanded the King of Kings fulfill his duty and obligation as God's earthly representative, to bring them peace, prosperity, and well-being. In return, the King of Kings required his subjects to defend him, so that as God's earthly representative, he might spread the glory of the true faith even farther.\nYet when the banner of the Fifth Monarchy was planted across the lands from the Caucasus mountains to the coasts of ancient Hyrcania, these covenant-makers secretly hindered the monarch's authority. They wielded the sovereign's power within their own granted lands while obstructing the King of Kings' authority from entering their fiefs.

Upon receiving the King of Kings' permission, he clapped his hands, instructing the guards outside to bring the slaves in one by one. After a brief commotion, the guards ushered the slaves into the King of Kings' chamber.\nBlack hair, blue eyes, various colors, shapes, and forms... The Governor of Egypt, to curry favor with the King of Kings, had vigorously sought out slaves he deemed exotic and sent them to the Iranian court, dressing them all in fine garments, hoping many would catch the King's eye and enter Kara Iskandar's palace. The slaves also knew a life-changing opportunity lay before them; each did their utmost to appear proper, hoping to enter the discerning gaze of the King of Kings.\nKara Iskandar lifted his head from the texts and documents, his eyes sweeping over each slave brought into his room. As each slave was stripped bare by the King's gaze, piercing their hearts, the sonorous verdict pronounced shook everyone present. Steward Jafar directed the guards to deliver these life-altered slaves to the places the King of Kings deemed necessary.\nTime seemed to fly. When the thunder ceased, the King of Kings merely gazed silently at the remaining individuals in the room. Steward Jafar left to attend to some matter outside, leaving only the King and the last two slaves who had received no judgment.\nNo further verdict came. The two remaining slaves standing in the room glanced slightly at each other—one saw the other's tall, sturdy frame, skin bearing unignorable scars; the other saw a slender figure, long hair failing to conceal shrewd eyes. 'Joseph, Jacob's most beloved son, was sold into slavery in Egypt and became Pharaoh's vizier.' Kara Iskandar's voice was no longer thunderously majestic; he walked slowly before them like an ordinary man facing his sons. 'You, the tall and sturdy one, look like a lion even without a sword. You, the slender one, seem a scholar even without robes. I see undeniable talent in both of you. I cannot bear to part with you to any place other than my own court. I have decided to let you grow under my wing, as my adopted sons.'\nThe King of Kings placed a hand on each man's shoulder, feeling an intense fervor radiating from beneath their garments. Both knelt, bowing their heads before the King of Kings, awaiting the key to a new life that Kara Iskandar would bestow upon them.\n'Your Majesty, I have a matter to report...' The door opened; Jafar entered looking embarrassed, as if dealing with a headache outside. Before the Steward could continue, the two Princes burst into the room, utterly disregarding Jafar's helplessness and anger. Kara Iskandar knew well the Princes had been intrigued by these people who looked so different from them since the slaves arrived. Jafar, as the Princes' tutor, wanted them to show better decorum before the King of Kings and was now fuming, his white beard bristling.\nThe King of Kings merely smiled, continuing to address his newly adopted sons.

Manuchehr 'Samson' cut down the guards rushing at him once more, but deep, bone-exposing wounds now marked his waist and abdomen. 'But can you keep winning like this against everyone else?'\nThe shattered holy state must be unified. Even without him, another King of Kings favored by fate would stand upon the stage. The King of Kings halted his guards' next intended assault. To this exhausted lion, he gave only this reply, nodding deeply this time. Then, he raised his weapon high towards the sky, as if awaiting God's final judgment."
EDG_AK2_event.66.a:0 "The King of Kings shook his head and dragged Polytropos forward, who was trying to give the lion a glorious death."
EDG_AK2_event.66.b:0 "Cannons roared. The long-awaited artillery shattered the lion and the stone pillar behind him, giving him a fitting end."

EDG_AK2_event.67.d:0 "'Alborz 'Solomon' has gone mad.' This was the sole thought in the mind of the fate-favored King of Kings as he led his army into Alborz's city.\nThe increasingly bleak prospect of victory drove this heir, famed for his wisdom, to madness. He removed all the holy crosses from his palace, melting down the gold and silver vessels seized from the clergy in furnaces to cast into grotesque pagan amulets. He broke the army's originally sacred banners, daubing them with the images of false gods and djinn marks gleaned from texts—profane things—believing this would somehow win the favor of pagan deities buried in history's dust, bringing victory after victory to his forces.\nBeneath eerie bone-white columns, the King of Kings' guards rescued townsfolk bound to wooden altars, listening with dread to their tearful accusations.\n'Alborz 'Solomon' has truly gone mad. He truly believes he is King Solomon himself...' The King of Kings and his guards struck together, felling yet another wave of fanatics—their bodies clad only in leather fixed with bone spikes, exposed skin painted with dizzying pagan sigils, dark blood slowly seeping from beneath wooden helmets encasing their heads.\n'Your Majesty, seventy-two of the fanatics survived. Their markings and adornments differ from the ordinary ones, seemingly another of Alborz's pagan schemes...' Deep within Alborz's citadel, now almost transformed into a pagan temple, an aide reported this meaningfully, as if believing such sorcery must conceal a conspiracy planned by Alborz's venomous intellect.\nThe King of Kings merely nodded, then kicked open the door to Alborz 'Solomon's' chamber, charging in with his guards, swords raised—\nNot only because Alborz 'Solomon's' desperate straits were known to all, but his torture of God's people and profane rituals worshipping pagan gods had ignited their righteous fury as true believers. Only by punishing the apostate within could so much blood be repaid.\nIn the square temporarily converted into a court, God's true representative pronounced judgment upon the crimes of Alborz 'Solomon,' now maddened to the point of calling himself only 'Gaetea.' Before him, the seventy-two surviving Antichrists were nailed to crosses. Then, a fire was set, reducing all the profane corpses, sigils, emblems, and banners to ashes."
EDG_AK2_event.67.a:0 "Alborz 'Solomon's' convert's zeal was shattered. After a desolate wail, only his limp body remained on the ground."

EDG_AK2_event.68.d:0 "When Rahman met the envoy from Hotak, he had referred to his foster brother's army as 'a formidable force no less than the lion army Manuchehr 'Samson' trained in India.' This proves neither of the foster brothers discerned the true nature beneath the impressive facade of this army they considered a formidable rival.\n'Your Majesty, this is the twelfth senior commander who has surrendered to us.' The King of Kings rode with his aide through the streets of Hotak's main camp. Behind them followed not only the King's own commanders but also numerous commanders who had defected from Hotak's forces. It wasn't that Hotak had promised them too little during this civil strife. On the contrary, he distributed all his long-accumulated wealth to his soldiers. Yet, they vanished from the army one by one, only to reappear elsewhere—in their hometowns, in other warlords' armies, or simply disappearing under assumed names.\nThey never trusted Hotak, especially after he righteously declared himself the first to denounce the rebellious Governor of Ajam, yet deliberately avoided conflict with him. This utterly destroyed his credibility among the soldiers, leaving only opportunists and fearless adventurers willing to fight for him.\nThese men, in turn, were surrounded by layers of demoralized troops, collapsing before the King of Kings' iron cavalry like a mountain avalanche, abandoning Hotak—this warlord wearing a lion's skin, pretending to be a lion—without hesitation.\nAt the start of the civil strife, Hotak may have truly believed he could achieve immortal fame, defeat his foster brother and the other two princes, and become the second King of Kings of Iran after Kara Iskandar. But now, as he is escorted by the true King of Kings' guards and kneels before him, he chooses to grovel, weep, and beg the truly great King of Kings, God's earthly representative, for a merciful end."

EDG_AK2_event.69.d:0 "If the fate-favored King of Kings were to rank all those now wielding swords on Iran's sacred soil on a scale of judgment, then Rahman, who first sought to usurp the supreme authority out of his own ambition, would be the undisputed chief sinner. Kara Iskandar, recognizing his talent, took him as a foster son, had his own wise son learn alongside him, to explore the mysteries of wisdom and refine his abilities. Yet when the tree of his talent finally bore fruit, the first to fall poisoned the King of Kings, plunging Sacred Iran into disarray.\nHe not only murdered the King of Kings, but also stole the royal city, the heart of Sacred Iran, usurping authority that was never his—he is the embodied sin of Pride and Envy, one of the corruptions Sacred Iran must purify.\nThe King of Kings' personal guards kicked open the palace doors, escorting him along a path all too familiar, toward the deepest part of the court, where the sacred throne resided—the last bastion of the detestable traitor.\nThe magnificent doors of the throne hall were dim, only traces of their once-gilded patterns remained. The King of Kings raised a hand to the guards beside and behind him, then slowly pushed open the final door to the stage of fate between him and Rahman.\nThe entire throne hall was unchanged from his memory. The rare treasures presented by governors from all lands still rested around the hall, like fierce beasts guarding the center.\nCountless splendid banners stood tall on either side of the path to the throne, testaments to the loyalty or blood offered to the King of Kings by subjects and foes alike, scrolls recording the sacred campaigns.\nOn either side of the throne stood the family banner symbolizing the sacred lineage of King of Kings Kara Iskandar and the national flag representing the entire land of Sacred Iran. The marble pillars before the banners, meant to hold the King's crown and scepter—the symbols of God's earthly representative's supreme authority, the very objects all contending Iranian warlords now strove for—stood empty.\nRahman's face was gaunt, his frame skeletal. The heavy crown threatened to topple his head; the scepter clamped between his legs had worn through the brocade robe, the injured flesh beneath no longer bled, awaiting only silent decay.\nIn each hand, he tightly clutched a worn, wooden puppet-show cross, its frayed strings taut, still suspending the remaining puppets for their master's manipulation. Rahman manipulated the puppets, repeating his dream: "The bubble-dream of reigning on earth for ten thousand years."\nThe King of Kings advanced slowly. The forest of splendid banners obscured his figure, yet the sharp sound of the cross-hilted sword being drawn made even Rahman, who seemed to have become a puppet himself, react. Still, he did not look upon the newcomer. He stubbornly raised the puppets and his dream high, like a monarch raising his scepter before a minister's petition. And the fate-favored King of Kings raised his own sword—"

To foster greater identification with the empire among these conquered peoples, to make the heart of the entire realm converge into a single voice, fierce debate has erupted in the court over the state's name.
