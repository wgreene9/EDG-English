EDG_mission_FRA_1_28_title:0 "The Reforms of Louis XII"
EDG_mission_FRA_1_28_desc:0 "The various political factions within our country have exerted a long-term influence on our nation. We must break free from them and pursue centralization. The 'New Monarchy' initiated by Louis XI was not a centralized, unified state. France was divided into 12 gouvernements, their administrative powers held in the hands of royalty, aristocracy, and prominent nobles. By the end of the century, they had legally exercised extensive royal prerogatives. It was not until the following century that they truly began to operate as one. Now, a large number of parlements have emerged locally. These provincial courts, established by the monarchy, hold supreme judicial authority in their respective regions. During this period, their importance grew, and their numbers steadily increased. From the accession of Charles VII to the death of Louis XII, parlements were established in Toulouse, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Dijon, Rouen, and Aix. While strengthening the position of municipal oligarchs at the expense of guilds and small proprietors, the liberties of the cities were not severely damaged. The reason these profound constraints on the centralized state persisted lies in the insurmountable obstacles encountered in establishing an effective framework for royal authority nationwide. Within the economic structure of the time, neither a unified market nor modern transportation facilities existed, and within the economic order, the most fundamental feudal relationships in the countryside had not completely disappeared. Despite the monarchy's remarkable achievements, the social foundation for implementing a vertically centralized political system was not yet in place. It was under these circumstances, after prolonged wars, that the atmosphere for the revival of the Estates-General was created. The knightly fervor of the modern state and emerging forces will shake the world. The emerging forces now belong to France, the most populous absolute monarchy, the sole Leviathan on the European continent. Machiavelli said, 'The French are humble and obedient; they hold their king in great esteem.' Maximilian agreed with Machiavelli, calling the French a servile people; the eminent English jurist John Fortescue echoed this, calling the French a cowardly nation... Indeed, in England, Spain, and the German lands, kings required the prior approval of representative assemblies to levy taxes; the French king alone was the exception."

EDG_mission_FRA_1_29_title:0 "Administrative Reforms" # Administrative Reforms of Richelieu
EDG_mission_FRA_1_29_desc:0 "Both in theory and in practice, the structure of the French monarchy possessed an extremely contrived complexity. In a memorable passage, Kossmann described its image in the minds of the contemporary propertied class: 'Contemporaries felt that absolutism had not eliminated the inherent tensions within the state, nor had it changed their conceptions of government. For them, the state resembled a Baroque church, where disparate concepts mingled, collided, and were ultimately fused into a single, magnificent system. In the architect's ingenious design, they discovered ellipses; space came alive. Light emanated from every angle of the ellipses, reflecting throughout the structure to create the most precious and agile active element and the wavering charm of the new style.' The French legal system was, both in design and implementation, rather unstable and antiquated. To secure our hold on the throne, we must reform the legal system and make it operate with the highest efficiency. Richelieu effectively established the intendant system. The Intendant de Justice, Intendant de Police, and Intendant de Finances were plenipotentiary commissioners endowed with broad powers. Initially, they were officials dispatched on special, temporary missions to inspect various regions, but later they became permanent representatives of the central government sent throughout France. Appointed directly by the King, their positions were thus irrevocable and unsalable: these officials were often former maîtres des requêtes and, in the 17th century, mostly minor or middle-ranking nobles. They represented the absolutist state in exercising new powers across the vast expanse of the kingdom."

Therefore, the Capetian family enthusiastically spread its branches throughout the nation, establishing cadet lines in various regions to prevent another powerful magnate from wresting the throne away from the Capetians. Admittedly, the relationship between the main line and the cadet branches grew less amicable as blood ties thinned. The cadet lines controlled local practical power, while the King of France could only retreat to the small Île-de-France. However, due to the checks and balances among the nobles and the enduring vitality of the main Capetian line, no noble attempted to seize the supreme throne—though their shared paternal ancestry with the French king endowed them with a natural right to contest it. We have been divided for far too long, and our territories have been encroached upon by foreigners for far too long. Unless France is unified under our banner, she will never be secure. The various families within our territory may not possess overwhelming power individually, but if we wish them to be readily summoned and cooperative, we must first appease them."

We shall reach the four corners of the horizon: the corner of the Rhine, the corner of the sea, the corner of the Pyrenees, and the corner of the Alps.

EDG_mission_FRA_2_9_desc:0 "Due to the military failures of Hugues VI, France faced invasions from multiple sides after 1430, particularly from Lotharingia. Crown Prince Hugues was tasked with the responsibility in a time of crisis, but found himself attacked from all directions and exhausted. Just as King Louis VII of Lotharingia arrived at Reims, unexpectedly, a peasant girl from Orléans named Jeanne d'Arc led the soldiers loyal to the Crown Prince to shut the gates of Reims, resisting the Lotharingian assault. This deprived the Lotharingian king of the best opportunity to be crowned at Reims and forced him to return to his lands to quell rebellions by German lords. In the subsequent war, Crown Prince Hugues successfully crowned himself King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, with Jeanne d'Arc by his side, repelling attacks from the Lotharingians, English, and Arlesians until 1444. To retaliate against the French, the English bribed the Papacy and declared Joan of Arc a heretic. This is a disgrace to France. We must demand that the Papacy retry the case of Joan of Arc."

In 1625, the Ministry of the Navy was formally established, with Richelieu himself serving as the Secretary of State for the Navy, overseeing all maritime affairs. Concurrently, naval bases were established in Toulon, Brest, Le Havre, and Bruges, and naval fleets were formed.

EDG_mission_FRA_2_24_desc:0 "Only by abandoning the system of feudal levies where lords summoned their vassals for military service and establishing a salaried, professional army can we achieve victory in increasingly brutal wars. To organize this professional force, the French nobility granted the monarchy approval to levy the first significant national tax—the taille royale (royal taille) in 1439, which by the 1440s became the regular taille des gens d'armes (soldiers' taille). The nobility, clergy, and a number of towns were exempt from this tax. Over the next century, the French nobility secured legal, hereditary tax exemption. Therefore, in the latter half of the 15th century, the monarchy had strengthened to such an extent that it possessed an early professional army known as the compagnies d'ordonnance (ordinance companies), commanded by nobles, and could levy taxes directly without the control of any representative assembly. The emergence of a limited royal army further augmented the economic privileges of the nobility, as the institutionalization of the taille guaranteed them, for the first time, complete fiscal immunity."

Each lance comprised 1 man-at-arms, 1 squire, 3 archers, and 1 servant. However, this organizational structure had little direct relation to tactical formation. The men-at-arms were grouped separately into tactical units, while the archers and squires did not charge alongside them but served as support personnel. Later, beginning around the time of Louis XII (1498-1515), they increasingly preferred to separate from the men-at-arms and form specific companies of their own, which soon came to be known as 'light cavalry'."

EDG_mission_FRA_3_12_desc:0 "In 1434, Swedish peasants and miners instigated unrest, followed by sporadic disturbances. Nobles across the land employed various methods to weaken royal power, prompting Eric to seek support from the domestic burgher class. He continuously allied with the burghers to attack noble factions, hoping to maintain his own power and weaken domestic opposition. However, the burghers in Denmark were even more wary of Eric's capriciousness and erratic temperament. In Aarhus, they convened a meeting and devised a plan to establish a commercial confederation. After Danish nobles opposed Eric's designated successor, Eric adopted a hardline stance, ultimately leading to civil war. The Swedish regent, Charles VIII, thereby gained complete control over Swedish governance, effectively separating Sweden and Norway from the Kalmar Union. Outmatched by the domestic nobility, Eric, in an effort to secure support from the burghers, continuously granted them more power, even turning to Charles VIII for support, promising to cede the Scania region to Sweden. With the help of Sweden and the domestic burghers, Eric successfully suppressed the domestic rebellion but was unwilling to cede Scania, leading Sweden to abandon its cooperative relationship with Eric and instead physically occupy Scania. Losing external aid, Eric became desperate to consolidate his rule within the country. He realized he had granted the burghers excessive power, to the point of threatening royal authority, and thus implemented many policies to weaken their power. This ultimately triggered a burgher uprising in 1439. The burghers defeated Eric, forcing him to grant greater autonomy to various municipalities, rendering the Kingdom of Denmark nominal and establishing a commercial confederation."

EDG_mission_FRA_4_4_desc:0 "While the Christian kings of the North were embroiled in internal strife, the Almohad Caliphate, beset by civil war, saw its power increasingly confined to the outskirts of Marrakesh as the Marinids resisted fiercely in northern Morocco. The hereditary governors originally entrusted with ruling the Iberian territories rushed to declare independence. Hegemony from Africa once again crumbled to dust in Iberia. Although the governors had initially signed a mutual defense pact vowing 'eternal peace among themselves,' the sprouting seeds of discord could not be constrained by mere paper. Iberia once more entered an era of warring states, which later historians would call the 'Third Taifa Period' during the first half of the 13th and 14th centuries. Throughout this 150-year period, border conflicts between Christians and Muslims never fully ceased. The most significant was a major offensive against Lisbon launched by the King of Portugal and the King of Asturias. However, due to overextension, they were ambushed by Muslims south of Coimbra and ultimately achieved nothing. Yet, as the Cathar forces steadily consolidated and grew stronger in Southern France, and Catholic states grew increasingly weary of the concept of crusades, the lands south of the Pyrenees gradually became a relatively independent 'small world' separate from the Catholic sphere. Although interference from outside occurred occasionally, it ultimately did not change the strategic stalemate between the two sides. However, when King Ignacio III of Asturias launched a crusade against Tulaytulah, the fires of conflict in Iberia were reignited once more."

EDG_mission_FRA_4_9_desc:0 "In 1428, dissatisfied with the French king's marginalization of him and incited by the Kings of England and Lotharingia, the Duke of Alençon declared his allegiance to England. King Hugues VI of France dispatched troops, attempting to seize Alençon and recapture Normandy in the process. However, he encountered resistance both internally and externally. The king's military ambitions were secretly resisted by his lords, who feared becoming the next Alençon. Due to the delayed assembly of his army, the king's forces were halted outside Caen, and Alençon ultimately turned its back on Paris. More fatally, Hugues VI was wounded by a stray arrow during the siege of Caen. Seizing the opportunity, King Louis VII of Lotharingia invaded France, defeated, and captured Hugues VI at Caen. Since King Louis VII's mother was a member of the Capetian dynasty, he forced Hugues VI to sign the 'Treaty of Caen,' demanding that Hugues VI revoke the inheritance rights of the French Dauphin, Hugues VII, and establish Louis VII as the heir to the French throne. Hugues VI soon died from infection, and Louis VII claimed the French throne, intending to be crowned King of France at Reims. Shortly after, English forces landed in Normandy, and Arles launched an invasion from the south. Dauphin Hugues was tasked with responsibility in a time of crisis, but found himself attacked from all sides and exhausted. Just as King Louis VII of Lotharingia arrived at Reims, unexpectedly, a peasant girl from Orléans named Jeanne d'Arc led the soldiers loyal to the Dauphin to shut the gates of Reims, resisting the Lotharingian assault. This deprived the Lotharingian king of the best opportunity to be crowned at Reims and forced him to return to his lands to quell rebellions by German lords. In the subsequent war, Dauphin Hugues successfully crowned himself King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, and successively repelled invasions from England, Lotharingia, and Arles. There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Lotharingia has long been a thorn in our side. If France is to establish continental hegemony, the Carolingian regime must be dismantled."

However, Francis sponsored many great artists of his time, including Andrea del Sarto and Leonardo da Vinci. The latter was persuaded to make France his home in his later years. Although Da Vinci painted little during his time in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa (known in France as La Joconde), which remained in France after his death. Other major artists who received Francis's patronage included the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the painters Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Primaticcio, all employed to decorate Francis's various palaces.
