NYGX_CDC_defend_fadima_title:"Defend the Fatimids"
NYGX_CDC_defend_fadima_desc:"Sulayman ibn Da'ud, descendant of Fatimah and Ali, the Most High and Noble Sayyid, the last of the Fatimid lineage. In 1185, a miraculously conceived mother was smuggled out of Cairo under cover of night, and thus Prince Sulayman was born into freedom, securing the final bloodline of the Fatimid house. His birth was seen as a divine favor from Allah. In his youth, he was captured and placed under house arrest by the Ayyubid dynasty. In the eyes of the Kurds, he was destined to become a caged bird like his father, but the turmoil caused by infidels presented an opportunity for this heir of the Imamate. In 1205, during a night of unrest in Cairo, Egypt, Prince Sulayman and a few loyal attendants slipped away amidst the chaotic crowds, evading Ayyubid surveillance. Leading a band more akin to mounted bandits than a proper army, he journeyed westward, bypassing the Christian-held Tunis to reach the Maghreb, the land where his ancestors had laid their foundations, guided by his unshakable conviction. At that time, the Almohad Caliphate was deeply mired in the fires of war ignited by the Tangiers uprising, unable to extend its reach to the east. The towns of Kabylia and Tlemcen each pledged allegiance to their own masters, and the order along the Barbary Coast had nearly collapsed. The Prince raised his banners, and the Isma'ilis, dissatisfied with the Almohad dynasty and the Sunni nobles who had once clung to its power but now harbored their own schemes, welcomed their incarnate Imam. Once, the Fatimid Caliphate rose from the shores of the Maghreb; today, he was born to be the leader of the Maghrebi Shia. Prince Sulayman arrived in the Maghreb with only eight horsemen in his train, yet when he arrayed his forces before the walls of Kabylia, tens of thousands of followers stood behind him. News of Kabylia's fall spread like a gale in deep winter, and cities across the Maghreb surrendered in swift succession. The planned 'Holy War' against the Maghreb by the Crusaders in Tunisia was also abandoned due to their crushing defeat in Egypt."

NYGX_CDC_destory_muwaxide_title:"Annihilate the Almohads"
NYGX_CDC_destory_muwaxide_desc:"The fates of Iberia and the Maghreb are bound by the same thread. Throughout the centuries of the Taifa period, whenever Christians attempted to reconquer the southern peninsula, a powerful Marrakesh-based dynasty stood in their way. And when the Christians retreated, Iberia would gradually slip back into the pattern of the Taifa era. The later Umayyads, the Almoravids, and the Almohads all fell victim to this recurring pattern. Since the dawn of the thirteenth century, the Mediterranean coast has been ablaze with conflict. Scattered uprisings gradually stripped the empire of its flesh, confining Almohad control to the vicinity of Marrakesh. In 1203, Tunisia was lost. In 1205, Kabylia and the entire coast of Algiers defected to the last scion of the Fatimid house. In 1215, the rebellion launched by the Marinid dynasty of the Zanata tribe dealt a heavy blow to the moribund empire. In 1248, the Marinids successfully assassinated the Almohad Sultan through a feigned surrender, and the flag of the Zanata tribe was raised over Fez by the Rif Mountains, with even the inland Tafilalt occupied. The Marinids in the east and the Almohads in the west were like the rising sun eclipsing the lingering twilight. The Marinids had long coveted the remaining Almohad lands but were restrained by the threat of the Neo-Fatimid state to the east. In 1258, the Marinid Sultan launched a southern campaign, marching directly on Marrakesh. The women of the Almohad court wept daily, praying for a true Mahdi to save them. Perhaps their prayers were answered, or perhaps it was a twist of fate, but Sultan Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq answered the call of the Divine in his military camp. Seeing unusual commotion in the enemy camp outside the city, the Almohads poured out and decisively routed the allied forces of the Zanata tribes. The Saadi ruler of Tafilalt quickly switched allegiance back to the Almohad dynasty. Thereafter, intermittent conflicts continued between the Marinids and the revitalized Almohad dynasty. Yet, one side received support from the Iberian Peninsula, while the other maintained long-standing amity with the Neo-Fatimid state. Thus, the Maghreb has since maintained a delicate and fragile balance."

NYGX_CDC_papal_do_sth_desc:"The religious and political landscape of North Africa is intricate and complex. Only the Holy See can provide us with sufficient support, whether spiritual, material, or military—all of which are essential to us at present."

NYGX_CDC_last_crusader_title:"The Last Crusaders"
NYGX_CDC_last_crusader_desc:"After seizing Tunis, a major rift emerged within the Crusader ranks. The Knights Templar advocated advancing from Tunis along the coast to capture Tripoli and Benghazi, thereby opening a route to attack Egypt. The Templar commanders deemed this the most logical and optimal path. In contrast, Stephen of Cloyes and the mercenaries hired by the French king argued for utilizing their naval superiority to land directly at Alexandria, thus bypassing the main Ayyubid forces blocking the way. The former supported this plan based on 'piety toward divine oracles,' while the latter backed it simply because the wealth of Tunis and Kairouan could no longer satisfy their greed. However, the Templars viewed this scheme as heretical and utterly impractical fantasy. In the spring of 1222, the Crusade formally split into two contingents. Before departure, they swore on silver tablets that the lands liberated by the Crusade would be governed by whichever side occupied them.\n\nYet the campaign against the Ayyubids did not proceed as smoothly as either side had anticipated. Contrary to the Templars' initial plans, the amphibious assault led by Stephen of Cloyes caused significant trouble for the Muslims. At that time, the Templars and the Muslims were deadlocked outside Benghazi. The sudden landing by the French forces successfully severed the Ayyubid army's supply lines, trapping the Muslim host in the water-and-grain-scarce Cyrenaica. Ayyubid Sultan Al-Kamil could only pin his hopes on a newly formed Mamluk army to recapture Alexandria. The leader of this Mamluk force, Sayf al-Din Ali, upon receiving the Sultan's authorization, made his first decision: to abandon Cairo.\n\nThis was a bold stratagem—a high-stakes gamble for the young general, for the entire Ayyubid dynasty, and for the Muslim world. To save the army in Cyrenaica, the retreat route had to be reopened. To reopen the route, Alexandria had to be retaken. To retake Alexandria, the main Crusader force had to be lured out. And to lure out the main Crusader force, a sufficient bait was needed to draw them into the trap. On the day Cairo was evacuated, young and old, men and women, streamed out of the abandoned city. Fires raged within, and the air was filled with weeping, shouting, and cursing. Most of the populace chose to flee up the Nile to Upper Egypt. The Mamluk army marched west out of the city, camping at Damanhur. Meanwhile, amidst the chaos, a young 'prisoner' named Sulayman ibn Da'ud journeyed westward. And in the midst of the tumultuous crowds, a mercenary force indeed headed for this now-unguarded city, while Stephen of Cloyes himself returned to Tunis to lead the 'holy warriors' who had been 'mobilized' under the banner of victory, eager for their share of the spoils. The gold, silver, and jewels left behind became the new loot for the Crusaders. Almost simultaneously, on a night with a crescent moon high, General Sayf al-Din Ali's Mamluks recaptured Alexandria. The tide of war turned instantly. It was no longer the Muslims but the Christians whose retreat was cut off. The Crusaders, who had just been reveling in triumph, were suddenly plunged into catastrophic peril. The mercenary leaders finally agreed to withdraw to the last Christian stronghold in the Levant—Acre. However, unwilling to abandon the wealth they had plundered from Egypt, the mercenaries were severely slowed by wagons overloaded with silks and jewels. They were caught west of Suez. Unfortunately, they were not Moses, and the pursuing Mamluks would not be swallowed by the waters of the Red Sea like the Pharaoh in the Bible. When news of the total annihilation of the naval Crusade arrived, the Knights were on the verge of capturing Benghazi. But the exhausted defenders, heartened by the Mamluk victory, rallied fiercely, while the Templars outside the walls began to waver. Ultimately, the Knights abandoned the siege of Benghazi and departed. The 'Frankish Crusade' thus ended in an anticlimax."

Naturally, it has been celebrated throughout Christendom for generations. Numerous accompanying clergy and later ecclesiastical chroniclers have striven to record this campaign, extolling the power of Christ, propagating it as a miracle. Jerusalem is of paramount importance to the Crusaders, and we are destined to recover it."

NYGX_CDC_sicily_title:"Seize Sicily"
NYGX_CDC_sicily_desc:"In 1411, Michael Angelos, a prince of the exiled Epirote dynasty in Italy, became the son-in-law of the Doge of Venice. Renowned in Venice for his exceptional diplomatic eloquence and courageous daring, he sought to counter Genoese influence over vital Mediterranean trade routes. Michael Angelos led a fleet, its core composed of Swiss and Lombard mercenaries, to land at Syracuse. Prior to this landing, his adjutant, Paolo Nosatti, infiltrated the Sicilian highlands, claiming to the locals that he was a Catholic believer and a Crusader come to save them from the Greeks. The mountain clans of Sicily, taking this at face value, not only provided detailed maps and garrison information of the island but also actively supplied Michael's forces after his landing. However, they were betrayed from the very beginning. Michael had not come to save them; his purpose was to overthrow the Genoese masters and establish the Venetians as Sicily's new overlords. Although Michael repeatedly promised equal autonomy for Catholics and Greeks after seizing power, the Sicilians grew deeply resentful of his duplicity. Simultaneously, a legend spread across Sicily: that Manfred himself had not fled the island, and that a posthumous child of his had been adopted by local Catholics. Of course, even if such a child had existed, they would have long since passed away. Yet this did not prevent 'true Sicilians' from finding a 'true Hohenstaufen king.' Like the Strait of Tunis, Sicily remained perpetually turbulent. The situation persisted until Emperor Isaac IV of Sicily died in 1443, succeeded by the 9-year-old Isaac V. Real power fell into the hands of Theodore Vatatzes. Young and capable, Theodore was, more importantly, an ambitious strategist supported by the vast majority of the military aristocracy. In November 1443, Theodore presented Isaac V with a definitive gift: he deposed the young emperor and, with the backing of the military nobility, became 'Lord Protector,' assuming supreme command over the state's military and administrative affairs. Theodore established a Protectorate Council, composed of military aristocratic commanders appointed by the Lord Protector himself, to oversee regional military and civil governance."

He would become known in history as 'Stephen of Cloyes,' claiming he had received a divine oracle in which Jesus commanded him to raise a Crusade himself. At that time, the cunning 'Fox,' Philip II, was already aged and ailing, so Stephen of Cloyes turned to petition Crown Prince Louis, the Count of Artois. Louis, despondent over his defeat in the first Barons' War and further troubled by the spread of Cathar heresy in the south, ultimately placed his faith in this young man who had little but fervent followers. With the Crown Prince's support, the predominantly French Knights Templar also invested in this Crusade, seeing it as a genuine 'Frankish Crusade' free from imperial interference. In the spring of 1221, the host marched south through Switzerland, bypassing Cathar-held territories, and sailed from Genoa. Their target, however, was not Egypt directly, but Tunis, to seize a springboard for an attack on Egypt. When lookouts on the walls of Tunis saw endless sails approaching from the north, they never imagined they would be the Christians' landing target. After token resistance, the defenders were driven from the city. Tunisian governor Abu Zakariya Yahya was captured. His brother Abdullah gathered remnants, occupied Kairouan, and faced off against the Crusaders in Tunis while seeking aid from his Almohad overlord. However, deeply mired in the Moroccan quagmire, the Almohads could offer little substantial help beyond a small contingent of over a thousand men. In their eyes, the Hafsid dynasty entrenched in Tunis was as vexing as the Crusaders, so they largely adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In the winter of 1221, Kairouan fell. The Grand Mosque within was thoroughly looted by the Crusaders, and the spiritual heart of North African Muslims henceforth flew Christian banners. Undoubtedly, this was a major victory for Christendom.\n\nYet after seizing Tunis, a major rift emerged within the Crusader ranks. The Knights Templar advocated advancing from Tunis along the coast to capture Tripoli and Benghazi, thereby opening a route to attack Egypt. The Templar commanders deemed this the most logical and optimal path. In contrast, Stephen of Cloyes and the mercenaries hired by the French king argued for utilizing their naval superiority to land directly at Alexandria, thus bypassing the main Ayyubid forces. The former supported this plan based on 'piety toward divine oracles,' while the latter backed it simply because the wealth of Tunis and Kairouan could no longer satisfy their greed. However, the Templars viewed this scheme as heretical and utterly impractical fantasy.\n\nIn the spring of 1222, the Crusade formally split into two contingents. Before departure, they swore on silver tablets that the lands liberated by the Crusade would be governed by whichever side occupied them. But the campaign against the Ayyubids did not proceed as smoothly as either side had anticipated; the 'Frankish Crusade' targeting Egypt ended in total annihilation. According to the prior agreement, Stephen of Cloyes and the Templar Grand Master agreed to use the island of Djerba as the boundary. Lands north of the island would belong to the Kingdom of Tunisia, ruled by Stephen of Cloyes as king, while lands south of the island would be under Templar control.

NYGX_CDC_10_t:"The End of the Almohads"
NYGX_CDC_10_d:"The fates of Iberia and the Maghreb are bound by the same thread. Throughout the centuries of the Taifa period, whenever Christians attempted to reconquer the southern peninsula, a powerful Marrakesh-based dynasty stood in their way. And when the Christians retreated, Iberia would gradually slip back into the pattern of the Taifa era. The later Umayyads, the Almoravids, and the Almohads all fell victim to this recurring pattern. Since the dawn of the thirteenth century, the Mediterranean coast has been ablaze with conflict. Scattered uprisings gradually stripped the empire of its flesh, confining Almohad control to the vicinity of Marrakesh. In 1203, Tunisia was lost. In 1205, Kabylia and the entire coast of Algiers defected to the last scion of the Fatimid house. In 1215, the rebellion launched by the Marinid dynasty of the Zanata tribe dealt a heavy blow to the moribund empire. In 1248, the Marinids successfully assassinated the Almohad Sultan through a feigned surrender, and the flag of the Zanata tribe was raised over Fez by the Rif Mountains, with even the inland Tafilalt occupied. The Marinids in the east and the Almohads in the west were like the rising sun eclipsing the lingering twilight. The Marinids had long coveted the remaining Almohad lands but were restrained by the threat of the Neo-Fatimid state to the east. In 1258, the Marinid Sultan launched a southern campaign, marching directly on Marrakesh. The women of the Almohad court wept daily, praying for a true Mahdi to save them. Perhaps their prayers were answered, or perhaps it was a twist of fate, but Sultan Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq answered the call of the Divine in his military camp. Seeing unusual commotion in the enemy camp outside the city, the Almohads poured out and decisively routed the allied forces of the Zanata tribes. The Saadi ruler of Tafilalt quickly switched allegiance back to the Almohad dynasty. Thereafter, intermittent conflicts continued between the Marinids and the revitalized Almohad dynasty. Yet, one side received support from the Iberian Peninsula, while the other maintained long-standing amity with the Neo-Fatimid state. Thus, the Maghreb has since maintained a delicate and fragile balance. But now, we have defeated the so-called Almohad Mahdi and hold the right to judge these self-proclaimed Unitarians."

In the Crusade launched against Egypt in 1222, the Crusaders had captured Alexandria, their forces advancing on Cairo, nearly overthrowing the Ayyubid dynasty. However, the Crusaders' overextension allowed the Muslims to cut off their retreat. The Muslims withdrew entirely from Cairo—the Crusaders triumphantly entered Cairo, only to realize it was a Muslim trap. After the Crusaders left Alexandria, General Sayf al-Din Ali's Mamluks swiftly recaptured the city. The tide of war turned instantly. It was no longer the Muslims but the Christians whose retreat was severed. The Crusaders, who had just been reveling in triumph, were suddenly plunged into catastrophic peril. The Crusader leaders finally agreed to withdraw to the last Christian stronghold in the Levant—Acre. However, unwilling to abandon the wealth they had plundered from Egypt, the mercenaries were severely slowed by wagons overloaded with silks and jewels. They were caught west of Suez. Unfortunately, they were not Moses, and the pursuing Mamluks would not be swallowed by the waters of the Red Sea like the Pharaoh in the Bible. When news of the total annihilation of the naval Crusade arrived, the Knights were on the verge of capturing Benghazi. But the exhausted defenders, heartened by the Mamluk victory, rallied fiercely, while the Templars outside the walls began to waver. Ultimately, the Knights abandoned the siege of Benghazi and departed. The 'Frankish Crusade' thus ended in an anticlimax; the Crusade against Egypt ultimately failed.
