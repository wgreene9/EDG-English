EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_2_title:0 "Develop Lombardy"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_2_desc:0 "Lombardy is already one of the wealthiest regions in Europe, and the foremost in all of Italy. By implementing new manufacturing measures in our homeland, we can transform into a true economic powerhouse."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_3_title:0 "All Roads Lead to Milan"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_3_desc:0 "In terms of ancient history and past prosperity, Milan is scarcely inferior to Rome. Now, in this era witnessing the revival of Italian culture and power, just as Rome once enjoyed, we have the opportunity to become the center of all Italy. To ensure that our current freedom and independence do not become a Last Supper, Milan must revive her prosperity and culture."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_4_title:0 "Remove the Thorn"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_4_desc:0 "Genoa's golden age has passed, and the republic's fate was completely rewritten in 1437. After the House of Savoy was occupied by the Cathars in Savoy and transformed into a republic, they were reduced to fallen nobility making a living as mercenaries. However, in 1437, the fate of the House of Savoy was altered once more. That year, the Golden Horde was embroiled in a rebellion and harassed by the Zaporozhian Hetmanate, leaving it weakened. Genoese Doge Isnardo Guarco saw this as a prime opportunity to expand along the Black Sea coast. To extend Genoese interests in the Black Sea region, the Doge hired Filiberto of Savoy to attack the coastal areas. As the Golden Horde was stretched thin, Filiberto soon seized a significant territory in the Azov region. However, Filiberto informed the Doge by letter that despite continuous victories in the offensive, he was still short-handed and required reinforcements. Doge Isnardo organized a Genoese army to assist Filiberto, who returned to Genoa in 1439 with news of victory. But unexpectedly for the Doge, Filiberto, through military achievements, prestige, bribery, and other means, took control of the army composed of mercenaries and Genoese citizens and occupied the Republic of Genoa, becoming its de facto ruler. Filiberto retained Genoa's existing state institutions but created a lifelong position for himself and essentially controlled all other state organs. Simultaneously, Filiberto's regime heavily relied on his mercenary band, securing many benefits for his soldiers and continuously recruiting mercenaries from other parts of Italy. When Filiberto died in 1443, his son Carlo di Savoy established a hereditary position for himself titled "Duke," which sparked discontent among Genoa's republican factions, leading to a rebellion. The rebels established a stronghold in Liguria but were suppressed by Carlo di Savoy. Although Carlo consolidated his rule in Genoa, as he had focused all his efforts on quelling the domestic rebellion, Genoa's overseas territories were conquered one by one—Corsicans revolted and established an independent republic, seeking support from the Holy Roman Emperor; Despot Theodore III Palaiologos seized Genoese outposts in the Aegean; Nikephoros and Theodore of the Doukas family led armies to capture the Genoese Republic's territories along the Black Sea coast. While Carlo maintained his rule, Genoa undoubtedly entered a period of decline. This nascent mercenary-ruled state would face more challenges, and for Genoa, Lombardy is the greatest threat. If we could incorporate Genoa's cities under the rule of our burgeoning [Root.GovernmentName], our strength would be greatly enhanced."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_5_title:0 "Expel the House of Savoy"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_5_desc:0 "By incorporating Genoa and the rest of Liguria into our realm, we can prepare to become a regional naval and trading power. Now that we control Genoa, the fate of the House of Savoy, who seized power in Genoa in the past, lies in our hands. We can choose to win them over or completely eradicate them and their influence in their homeland."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_6_title:0 "Invade Tuscany"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_6_desc:0 "The cities of Tuscany have long tempted the Dukes of Lombardy with their wealth. Integrating them into our state would be a major step forward in our endeavor to establish a powerful nation in Northern Italy. The city-states of Tuscany and the regions of Emilia-Romagna lack strong ruling forces. We should... persuade them to allow us to provide and exercise such ruling power. The former Dukes of the Visconti family of Milan repeatedly waged wars to control the borders of Tuscany, but these wars were in vain. Cities like Pisa and Florence still resisted us, and we must crush their resistance and seize the artworks they created during the tide of the Renaissance."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_8_title:0 "The Renaissance"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_8_desc:0 "Since the 14th century, the plutocratic clans of the Italian city-states have been sponsoring artists and scholars interested in exploring the societies of their ancient Greek and Roman ancestors. The Renaissance, as a cultural movement, has deeply and widely spread throughout Italy, profoundly influencing literature, art, philosophy, and music. Humanists are also studying and analyzing the societies they live in, comparing them with the ideals of classical philosophy. Renaissance humanism has matured and is poised to permeate all aspects of society. A new way of thinking is emerging for both rulers and the ruled, and with the help of early printing presses, these novel ideas are spreading rapidly. A true Renaissance humanist must be well-versed in all aspects, not only specializing in politics and philosophy but also engaging with art, textual analysis, music, and architecture. Now, the Renaissance is ready to reshape the entire world, guiding it towards its classical ideals."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_9_title:0 "Education for the Elite"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_9_desc:0 "Education is a matter of great importance. Our Council of Philosophers is eager to develop domestic education to achieve prosperity in thought and culture. As a distinguished nation, our country is a bastion of noble demeanor and progressive thinking. For the stability of society and the strength of the government, we must uphold tradition. A prosperous and prestigious [Root.GovernmentName] like ours is poised for a cultural flourishing, with renewed interest in art, science, and what some call 'humanism.' We should do everything in our power to support this movement."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_10_title:0 "Nation of the Wise"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_1_10_desc:0 "We are the center of thought and culture in all of Europe. The influence of our philosophers, our ideas, and our debates on religion and philosophy on European intellectual circles grows ever stronger. From Lombardy to Rome, thinkers are increasingly turning their attention to the discussions of Lombard philosophers concerning the nature of the world."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_1_title:0 "Vicar of the King of Italy"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_1_desc:0 "To maintain the Empire's influence in Northern Italy, Sigismund I granted the title of 'Vicar of the King of Italy' to Duke Filippo of Lombardy, making Lombardy the de facto master of Italy."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_3_title:0 "Consolidate Feudal System" # Consolidate the Feudal System
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_3_desc:0 "Although we are already the most powerful ruler in Italy, our rule remains unstable. Our vassals pay us lip service, while the lords of Romagna and Montferrat yearn to regain their independence."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_5_title:0 "Control the Western Passes"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_5_desc:0 "We control vast swathes of land in Piedmont; however, the Counts of Saluzzo and Montferrat still maintain a degree of independence. We should consolidate our power and bring them under our direct rule. Savoy and Piedmont are located on the same highlands of the Alps, possessing natural geographical advantages. Greatly reinforcing the defenses here will surely make us unbeatable against foreign invasions."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_7_title:0 "Control the Vatican"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_7_desc:0 "The Pope is not only the spiritual leader of Catholicism but also a temporal power possessing vast territories in Italy. Thus, he could be a fearsome enemy. Regardless, we must ensure that his considerable strength does not obstruct our interests."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_8_title:0 "Abundance of Talent"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_8_desc:0 "Italy has long been the heartland of intellectual currents and artistic achievements. Centers of academic education have done much to disseminate ideas and inspire new generations of thinkers and artists. We should spare no effort in supporting these fine traditions and expanding them."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_9_title:0 "The Finest of the Finest"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_2_9_desc:0 "Our great unification cannot be limited to politics alone. We must spare no effort to provide security and wealth for all Italians, so that we may all prosper. Foremost among this should be a flourishing of thought and culture; our Council of Philosophers' thirst for artworks can no longer be restrained."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_2_title:0 "Military Authority"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_2_desc:0 "We must establish a powerful army to protect the nation from the covetous eyes of our watchful neighbors. More importantly, only by centralizing military authority in the hands of our leader can we maintain domestic stability."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_4_title:0 "Consolidate Independence"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_4_desc:0 "The allure of Lombardy attracts the great powers of Europe, whose gazes upon the wealthy yet fragmented Italian peninsula are often filled with greed. To survive and prosper, we need to befriend powerful allies who can help us fend off potential aggressors."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_5_title:0 "Shadow Kingdom"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_5_desc:0 "Under imperial rule, we enjoy considerable autonomy granted by the Empire. However, despite our deep ties to the Empire, as its influence in Northern Italy wanes and the cost of maintaining the connection rises, perhaps we should consider severing ties with the Empire to prevent them from hindering our independent rule."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_6_title:0 "The Alpine Mountains"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_6_desc:0 "The Alps are the guardians of Italy. By establishing a strong Alpine defense line, we will be able to ensure our beautiful and bountiful homeland remains unspoiled by foreign invaders."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_8_desc:0 "Our humble [Root.GovernmentName] can remain humble no longer. As our territory expands, so too do our ambitions; we deserve a higher status."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_9_title:0 "Expel the Normans"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_9_desc:0 "Stability alone is insufficient to improve the quality of life for all our people. This is especially true for Southern Italy, a land that has endured immense hardships since ancient times. If we wish for all of Italy to be closely united under our rule, we must pay special attention to the south. We should set our sights on Naples, a region with a glorious history and abundant wealth. By controlling Naples, we will command a key position in the western seas of Italy and gain an advantage in diverting Mediterranean trade."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_10_title:0 "Restoring Italy's Freedom"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_3_10_desc:0 "The Greeks have seized Sicily and established a protectorate council on the island. They believe they can rule Sicily indefinitely, enslaving the local Sicilians, but this can never be allowed to happen. We will liberate Sicily from the hands of foreigners."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_1_title:0 "The Golden Transformation"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_1_desc:0 "Compared to the autocratic rule of a Duke, some citizens prefer a republican government. We must resolve the disagreements among the various classes on this issue: should Lombardy become a republic or remain a duchy?"

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_2_title:0 "Reining in the Guilds"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_2_desc:0 "Despite the intricate connections between our rulers and the Council of Philosophers, the guilds remain a force that could potentially hinder the state's perfect public authority. We need to define our relationship with the guilds to establish a clearer political system."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_3_title:0 "Restore Order"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_3_desc:0 "Rebellious vassals, an angry Emperor, and a Pope plotting revenge all threaten the survival of the Lombard [Root.GovernmentName]. To ensure our nation's survival, we must secure sufficient recognition."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_4_title:0 "The Council of Philosophers"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_4_desc:0 "Duke Filippo relied on the guilds to extract wealth from Italy, and in return, the guilds naturally demanded power from the Duke. Among the scholars at the academies established by the Duke, a group advocated for learning the arts of ancient Greece and establishing a "model state" governed by philosophers from the top down. Their ideas gained significant traction in Lombardy. Philosophers could not possibly covet the Visconti throne, but the Duke himself had no issue presenting himself as a philosopher. In 1440, Lombardy held its first "Council of the Wise," presided over by the Duke himself, with participants including scholars from the Milanese academies and distinguished notables from various autonomous cities, who were backed by the city guilds and the merchant class that comprised them."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_5_title:0 "Unite the Kingdom" # Establish the United Kingdom

EDG_MISSION_MLO_4_9_desc:0 "Italy's wealth makes her a prime target for expanding states. In our hands, this wealth will accelerate our rise to become a European power. By introducing modern economic practices and investing in our urban development, we can make our nation a powerhouse capable of dominating the world [Root.GetSavPowerhouseNorthOrSouthDesc]. Political leadership will inevitably follow economic hegemony."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_2_title:0 "Archbishop of Milan"

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_4_title:0 "Claim Venetia"
EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_4_desc:0 "Venice is the jewel in Italy's crown. Our rule in the north will not be secure unless we bring it under our control. The Venetian archipelago serves as both a haven for ships and a highly profitable trading port. Our immediate priority is to seize that prosperous water-girded land and use it for the benefit of [Root.GetName]."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_5_title:0 "Tame the Golden Lion" # Tame the Golden Lion of the Aegean
EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_5_desc:0 "The verdant hills of Venice are calling us. For too long, we have remained confined to our own small patch of land. Now is the time to strike out and expand into Venice. Venice's ancient rival, the Pope, will provide us with a legitimate pretext for invasion."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_6_title:0 "Control Dalmatia"

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_9_desc:0 "Local problems should be solved locally. Forming alliances with powers outside Italy will only lead to dependency, debt, and loss of sovereignty. We must rely on ourselves."

EDG_MISSION_MLO_5_10_desc:0 "Whether it is all the treaties we sign, the agreements we reach, or the promises we make to our people, to fulfill them, the military power of our [Root.GovernmentName] must be strong.
