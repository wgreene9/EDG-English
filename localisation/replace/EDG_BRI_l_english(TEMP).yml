EDG_string_start_BRI:0 "§YGilles and the Duchy of Brittany§!\nDuring the §YWars of the Four Nations§!, §YGilles de Montmorency-Rais§! served as a §YFrench military commander§! against the §YEnglish§! and, through military strategy and political maneuvering, seized the title of §YDuke of Brittany§! with the aid of §YHugh the Victorious§!.\nBetween 1428 and 1430, Gilles de Montmorency-Rais fought alongside §YJoan of Arc§!. At the §YBattle of Reims§!, he commanded the left-wing cavalry contingent, charging the §YLotharingian§! pike squares three times to breach a gap for Joan's main forces. When Joan's white standard was struck down by §YArles§! crossbowmen, Gilles personally led a countercharge with two hundred heavy cavalry, shattering the enemy commander's helmet with a mace to reclaim the banner. During the §YSiege of Jargeau§!, he relinquished half his grain supplies to Joan's besieging troops, leaving his own soldiers to subsist on acorn bread for five consecutive days. This tactical coordination enabled the allied forces to recapture twelve fortresses within six months, completely reversing the French southwestern front's disadvantage.\nAfter the §YRelief of Orléans§!, Gilles de Montmorency-Rais cited a moth-eaten parchment documenting his family's marital ties to the Montfort faction in the 1341 §YWar of the Breton Succession§!, thus establishing legal grounds for his claim.\nTo seize the ducal throne of §YBrittany§!, a mere claim was insufficient. Gilles mortgaged his estate at Croîtier in the Loire Valley to §YHugh the Victorious§! in exchange for eight thousand infantry and thirty siege cannons. The following March, he led his forces along the Vilaine River to raid §YNantes§!, first using fireships to destroy the Breton fleet anchorage, then bribing the garrison's lieutenant to open the Saint-Pierre Gate. As the English defenders retreated to the castle keep, Gilles ordered the moat filled with carcasses of fallen warhorses, erected scaling ladders, and launched day-and-night assaults, ultimately capturing §YNantes§! by igniting and burning the northwestern tower.\nIn February 1430, under the pretext of suppressing Breton coastal piracy, Gilles marched the eight thousand infantry acquired through mortgaging his estate into Angers. He secretly contacted pro-French nobles within Nantes, pledging to preserve their feudal privileges. On the night of March 7, thirty modified fishing boats carried three hundred desperadoes down the Loire River, using Greek fire to set ablaze the English warships White Lion and Black Duke anchored in the harbor. Amid the towering flames, the garrison lieutenant opened a side gate—this man was later knighted and granted three mills near Rennes as reward. Street fighting persisted for four days, with Gilles applying hard-won experience gained from Flemish mercenaries: after seizing each district, he barricaded intersections with overturned wagons and market stalls, gradually compressing the Breton defenders into the castle district. When the remaining six hundred survivors retreated into the Ducal Castle of Brittany, Gilles ordered the felling of century-old oaks to build trebuchets while tunneling under the fortress walls to pack gunpowder at their foundations. At dawn on March 15, the northwestern tower collapsed in a chain of explosions, the garrison commander falling to his death in the moat, and §YRennes§! fell to Gilles.\nAfter capturing Nantes and Rennes in succession, the §YHouse of Dreux§! submitted to Gilles, and other Breton lords swiftly surrendered. Gilles de Montmorency-Rais posted proclamations in churches, announcing the restoration of Brittany's pre-1341 §YEstates General§! tradition to secure clerical support. Concurrently, he promised a five-year salt tax exemption for cities like Rennes and Vannes, winning the backing of the burgher class.\nIn May 1430, during his ducal coronation at Rennes' Saint-Pierre Cathedral, Gilles deliberately used an ancient 13th-century crown exhumed from John V's tomb and was anointed by the Archbishop of Rouen—an act that thoroughly dispelled controversies over his legitimacy. Yet Gilles' rule was not flawless; suspected Dreux loyalists spread rumors that Gilles worshipped §MSatan§! and practiced §Mblack magic§!.\nGilles repeatedly vouched for Joan's strategic value before Hugh VII, even deploying the Breton fleet in 1432 to escort the Maid to Calais for negotiations. In his later-funded chronicle, The Campaign Records of Duke Gilles de Montmorency-Rais of Brittany, all thirty-seven references to Joan remained strictly within the scope of military cooperation. Only a faded ink note in a margin read: “Les choses que mon cœur aime” (§MThe things my heart loves§!)—later scholars identified this as the codeword of Gilles de Montmorency-Rais's private troops, though its exact meaning remains a mystery to this day."

EDG_Gallic_parliament_monarchy_desc:0 "Gaul is rooted in the traditional culture of the Celtic Gauls, where the monarch is regarded as God's representative, holding ultimate authority over executive, legislative, and judicial decisions while firmly controlling military power. The Prime Minister and civil officials are appointed by the monarch, and the noble parliament cannot restrain the monarch's power."
EDG_Gallic_autocratic_monarchy_desc:0 "Gaul's power structure is built upon traditional Celtic Gallic culture. While the monarch serves as national symbol with elevated status, power is not concentrated solely in their hands. The parliament consists of representatives elected from various regions, primarily from emerging Gallic noble families well-versed in ancient customs and laws. This parliament deliberates on major affairs and formulates legislation, holding particular decision-making authority regarding matters of national tradition such as land and religious rites. The monarch controls military and foreign affairs, though key decisions require consultation with the parliament."

EDG_BRI_Integrate_cavalry_desc:0 "The French king's Ordinance Cavalry is divided into 15 companies, each consisting of 100 lances. Each lance comprises 1 heavy knight, 2 mounted archers, 1 light cavalryman, and 2 non-combatant squires - totaling 9,000 men across all companies, with 6,000 being combat personnel. After years of reforms, the French compagnie d'ordonnance system has gradually perfected itself, and we shall now integrate this institution."
EDG_BRI_Seanchus_desc:0 "The Brehon Laws constitute a traditional Celtic legal system. Their existence for nearly three millennia stands as testament to the sense of honor among the people they governed. These laws are 'laws of users' - that is to say, they derive their authority from public consensus, expressing the moral force of the people under their jurisdiction. This moral force represents the principle of integrity that permeates ancient legal and wisdom texts. A person's promise must be honored. As user-based laws, the Brehon Laws cannot be altered without public approval. Therefore, any amendments to existing laws or creation of new ones can only be achieved through open forums during assemblies. Thus, while certain individuals may campaign for specific laws, it requires a majority vote among the 'free' men to enact legislation. Truly, the Brehon Laws embody government of the people, by the people, and for the people."
EDG_BRI_tuath_desc:0 "The 'Tuath' (tuath) is composed of all free landholders, professionals, and craftsmen. Historically, this institution served as the enforcer of laws. Annually, members of the Tuath would gather to determine all common policies, declare war or make peace with other Tuaths, and elect or depose their 'king'. Notably, no one was bound to a particular Tuath - individuals could freely (and frequently) leave one Tuath to join a rival one. Thus, each Tuath functioned as a voluntary association formed by the landed properties of its willing members, capable of maintaining law and order through an intricate system of sureties. Today, we have adopted the Tuath as our national assembly."
EDG_BRI_Prosecutor_Office_desc:0 "The monarch shall appoint the most capable prosecutors to oversee the nation's economy, rigorously combating corruption and malfeasance."

EDG_flavor_BRI_mission.0.desc:0 "During the Hussite Wars, Gilles de Montmorency-Rais was dispatched by the French king as a military commander to Bohemia to join the crusade against the Hussites. Through military strategy and political maneuvering, and with the help of Richard III, he seized the Duchy of Brittany.\n\nDuring the Hussite Crusade, he fought alongside the Maid of Bohemia (Joan of Arc) and repeatedly assisted this maiden from Orleans in shining on the battlefield. Their excellent tactical coordination enabled the crusaders to capture twelve fortresses within six months, completely reversing the Catholic disadvantage in Bohemia since Sigismund's intervention.\n\nAfter the Siege of Prague, Gilles de Montmorency-Rais returned to France to continue serving the king. His performances in the Bohemian Crusade, the French succession wars, and the Low Countries Wars earned him the title of Marshal of France. He produced a moth-eaten parchment documenting his family's marital ties to the Montfort faction during the 1341 Breton War of Succession, thus establishing his legal claim. But to become a duke, claims alone were insufficient. Gilles mortgaged his estate at Croisilles in the Loire Valley and Breton loyalties to Richard III in exchange for French military support. The following March, he led troops along the Vilaine River to raid Nantes. When defenders retreated to the keep, Gilles ordered dead warhorses thrown into the moat while scaling ladders were erected for round-the-clock assaults, ultimately succeeding in burning the northwest tower and capturing Nantes.\n\nIn February 1430, Gilles stationed 8,000 French troops in Angers under the pretext of suppressing Breton pirates. He secretly contacted Nantes nobles, promising to preserve their privileges. On the night of March 7th, ten modified fishing boats carrying daredevils drifted downriver, using Greek fire to ignite ships in the harbor. Amid the towering flames, the garrison's deputy opened a side gate. When the remaining six hundred defenders took refuge in the Ducal Castle of Brittany, Gilles ordered century-old oaks felled to build trebuchets while sappers tunneled to place gunpowder under the walls. At dawn on March 15th, the northwest tower collapsed in chain explosions, the defending commander fell into the moat and died, and Rennes fell to Gilles.\n\nAfter successively capturing Nantes and Rennes, Brittany submitted to Gilles, with other lords swiftly following suit. Gilles posted proclamations in churches announcing the restoration of Brittany's pre-1341 Estates-General traditions to secure clerical support. Simultaneously, he promised five-year salt tax exemptions for cities like Rennes and Vannes, winning burgher allegiance.\n\nIn May 1430 when Gilles received the ducal crown at Rennes Cathedral, he deliberately used an ancient 13th-century crown exhumed from John V's tomb, anointed by the Archbishop of Rouen - this act completely dispelled inheritance disputes. But Gilles' rule wasn't flawless, as suspected former Dreux loyalists spread rumors of his Satan worship and black magic studies.\n\nYet Gilles' Bohemian experience left him struggling with self-doubt for the rest of his life. He saw clergy wielding butcher knives, witnessed holy crusaders committing atrocities against innocents, and watched people of different faiths slaughter each other. Sin and massacre - in his early life he had been a devout yet straightforward knight, but his later years were consumed by self-doubt. He bid farewell to his zealous comrade Joan, returning to France with inexplicable feelings toward heretics - or perhaps the misguided."

The Breton language also belongs to the Celtic family, sharing similar linguistic structures and vocabulary with Welsh and Scottish Gaelic.\n\nSome Bretons consider themselves descendants of Celtic Gauls, an identity rooted in pride for their national history and culture. By emphasizing their Celtic heritage, they seek to preserve Brittany's distinctiveness and independence. At the same time, as cultural exchanges between Brittany and other French regions intensified over time, French language, literature, art, and religion gradually spread to Brittany, profoundly influencing local culture. Thus there also exists a faction of Bretons who maintain a French cultural identity.\n\nNow, as Europe enters the Renaissance period amid continuous social and political transformations, Brittany too is affected by these great changes. Within our court, the Celtic faction and French faction stand in opposition, their conflicting visions of cultural identity having reached an irreconcilable point where we must make a choice."

Born in the blood-tinged dawn of Champtocé Castle, he inherited his bloodstained family crest at eleven, learning to armor his broken heart under his grandfather's iron rule. When the Lorraine shepherdess Joan arrived at Wenceslaus V's camp with divine golden edicts, this notoriously brutal French crusader was building battle honors with corpses from gallows - until the king's scepter pointed to that coarse-clad maiden. 'I would follow your sacred soul with the Mass of my heart,' Gilles whispered as he knelt.\n\nWhen Joan's white banner pierced Sigismund's trebuchet lines, Gilles led heavy cavalry to cut off Hussite retreats, his devastating rear charge scattering enemies across Bohemia in blood-soaked victories. They shared hardened bread on horseback and read Revelations by campfires. Come spring, the Baron entered Nantes Castle in eagle-feather cloaks, where the Breton ducal throne still bore defenders' blood and celebratory wine stains. Eight thousand French veterans stood arrayed behind him, armor glinting on the Loire: 'This authority belongs to your angel-blessed soul,' he'd sometimes murmur to Joan at drunken feasts, 'I remain ever your blade for God's work.'\n\nFor ten years Gilles moved between two crowns as legend. Some knew him as the iron-fisted Duke who crushed Breton rebels with black magic, others as the simple man who sent yearly letters to a Bohemian maiden. But the object of his affection had vowed herself wholly to God, while the hellscapes he witnessed in Bohemia waged eternal war with his soul's foundations on stormy nights.\n\nWhen the war ended in pouring rain outside Prague, with Sigismund's last forces surrendering their swords, Gilles stood apart in twilight's glow at the victory feast, cup raised toward the maiden at its center. The wine shimmered strangely in fading light - turbid as his struggling faith.\n\nNow gazing from Nantes Castle's new towers, Gilles watches white calla lilies bloom in meadows below. From beneath his armor, he produces a battered wooden crucifix. 'I was no Roland,' he smiles at dim stars as his scepter slips loose, 'but at least I outdid La Hire.' Yet his fervent heart wars with his devout soul - longing to declare his love like a cavalry charge, though knowing her answer, still tormented by Bohemia's wailing dead."

Through years of shared battles and countless storms of steel, those precious moments have become indelible marks upon my life. Amidst this war-torn land and endless smoke of war, my heart and soul cannot escape your shadow. Those determined, burning eyes of yours gave me immeasurable courage on the battlefield.

Yet I must cruelly say I cannot reciprocate as you hope. This decision tortures me as if pierced by countless needles. I hate that my refusal will wound you, yet I cannot betray my conscience. I pray you understand. Your courage and passion will forever be heroic in my heart. Though our paths diverge, may our souls meet again in God's time. Whatever comes, I'll cherish our memories - you are my life's radiant light, never forgotten.\n\nForgive my inability to return your love.

Gathering courage, he murmured: 'I think of you constantly, wishing to share all my joys and sorrows. Her words still haunt me - do you understand?' Her voice, like morning dew, answered all his longing: 'She abandoned you, but you're my everything.' Francesca clasped his neck, passionately kissing his cheek. 'Forget her, Gilles. You don't yearn for her - you repent past sins. You're no sinner, just another of God's lost sheep.'\n\nBeneath gentle moonlight, they walked under starry skies, quietly enjoying each other's company. In their hearts, love flowed like ocean tides - sometimes calm, sometimes turbulent, but never ceasing.\n\nThat starry night, their passion became irresistible.

Léo approached as if dragging weights, gently taking Jeanne's trembling hands - vessels for all their unspoken pain.\n\n'Jeanne, I...' Léo's voice cracked, words failing him.

Her gloves creaked in her clenched fist. He would never return, and she might not live long enough to see him - her coming-of-age approached, and François would never permit her to rule. Visions of Emma's flayed corpse haunted her.

The road from barracks to throne room bristled with guards - infantry to the left, cavalry to the right. Léo de Rennes, having served diligently as Chamberlain to earn François's trust, walked armored before him. Many in François's guard owed their positions to Léo's recommendations.

# EDG_flavor_BRI_mission.100.desc: "Many years later, Gilles might recall that fateful night. The witch kneeling before him under the moonlight. Though the memory has faded, the faint scent of jasmine remains vivid - that nightmare fragrance haunting him daily, pulling him back to that ominous moonlit night. In his mind's eye, her smooth, neatly arranged hair seems to shimmer, her indistinct face bearing an intoxicating beauty, revealing a mysterious, enchanting smile.\n\nHe wonders - had he spared that witch, would everything be different? Might he have had a happier family? Those soul-piercing, pitiful eyes, like pools of starlight, brimming with clear yet burning tears. Her eyes were magic mirrors that still appear hauntingly before him, reflecting his younger self. Fate once laid a path before him, yet he chose another winding road into the distance."

Reportedly driven by fear of a French invasion, [BRI.Monarch.GetName] chose to sacrifice themselves to secure Brittany's independent development for the next fifty years. The cost? Merely that [BRI.Monarch.GetName] would spend the rest of their life in Paris. If this could save Brittany, they were willing to pay the price.\n\nOn that day, the streets of Paris were packed. People gathered to catch a glimpse of the new Queen Mother of France, said to be as beautiful as a celestial being. Nobility from across Europe flocked to the Château de Langeais to witness the couple. [FRA.Monarch.GetName] had specially commissioned artists from Italy to furnish and adorn the castle with the most fashionable Renaissance-style furniture and decorations. As God's servant solemnly recited the vows, only one question remained."
