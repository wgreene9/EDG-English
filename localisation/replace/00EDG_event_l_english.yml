Within a short span, former governors of Bengal, Jaunpur, Sindh, Multan, and the Bahmanis all declared independence. The Sayyid dynasty once seized power in Delhi itself, yet astonishingly, Firuz Shah's grandson Ibrahim inherited the Sultanate and managed to reunite the nearly fragmented realm, ruling to this day and maintaining the crumbling Delhi Empire at 78 years old. After Firuz Shah restored the Jagir system, military governors controlling regional fiefdoms wielded substantial local power, particularly the four major governors. While they still pledge allegiance to the distant Ibrahim in Delhi, they remain restless, eager to break free from the Sultan's rule.\n\nThe Lodi family of Sirhind currently serves as the Delhi Sultanate's most crucial supporter. They hold influence over most Afghan nobles within the kingdom and thus can maintain order in the few remaining loyal territories. In return, our predecessors granted them considerable influence and power. However, with Bahlul Lodi becoming the family head, Delhi faces renewed risks. Reports suggest Bahlul plans to march on Delhi, impose his will upon the Sultan, and potentially end the Tughlaq dynasty."

Considered highly educated, he spoke multiple languages including Hungarian, German, Latin, French, and Italian, and passionately participated in knightly tournaments including jousting.

Now, the great Sigismund has no direct heir. Under his arrangement, the throne should have passed to his son-in-law Albert II of Habsburg, but Albert died fighting the Turks.

As Turks established absolute dominance in Anatolia, the Byzantine Empire found itself surrounded by powerful enemies. Although Timur's disruption of West Asian order provided Byzantium with valuable breathing space, the Eastern Roman eagle ultimately bowed its noble head as its territories in Thrace and Greece fell to adversaries. With the 1453 fall of Constantinople, we replaced the Greeks as masters of the City the World Desires, fully entitled to claim the legal titles of the Eastern Roman Empire. The establishment of new dynastic governance has become an irreversible trend. Many former Byzantine naval officers and sailors have now accepted our rule and joined our ranks.

Therefore, [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognized the necessity of not just a land army but also naval power. Fully appreciating the sea's significance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] prioritized this matter extensively. Consequently, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] allocated funds to assemble a fleet comprising not only conscripted older vessels but also newly constructed ships rapidly built in shipyards along the Aegean coast. If this plan proceeds, by spring 1453 this fleet will depart from Gallipoli under the imperial naval commander's leadership and enter the Sea of Marmara.

If internal noble conflicts could be reconciled, they might elect the Grand Duke of Lithuania as the new monarch, but Poland now faced deeper divisions.\n\nAs the Hussite Wars expanded, Jan Hus's teachings spread to southern Poland. Many lesser nobles in Lesser Poland converted to Hussitism, believing it to be the true faith. After Władysław III's death, they exploited the power vacuum to overthrow local magnates, seized control of Lesser Poland, and established a Hussite noble republic with its supreme institution called the 'Purification Committee.'\n\nSiemomysł III, Duke of Greater Poland, had long maintained ties with Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Understanding that Polish kings had spent the past century strengthening centralization while imperial princes gained increasing autonomy, he aspired to become a West Slavic imperial prince like Bohemia—securing protection from the Teutonic Order while expanding influence into Pomerania. Thus, Siemomysł III refused submission to the distant Kraków court, achieving de facto independence.\n\nWith Poland split between north and south, the Duchy of Mazovia also developed separatist tendencies. Consequently, the central court in Kraków lost control over most territories, rendering the Polish kingship an empty title. While the Kraków throne remained vacant, Greater Poland's ruler had no interest in becoming Duke of Kraków, and the Sandomierz-based state was a republic—only the Piast ruler of Mazovia remained as potential candidate for the next 'King of Poland.'"

As the Reconquista advanced, northern Christians began counterattacking and liberating lost territories, with some Mozarabs fleeing to reclaimed regions to repopulate abandoned towns, particularly in the Kingdom of León, reestablished from Asturias in 910. During this expansion, Iberian Christians reconnected with the Pope and other European nations, with Catalonia—liberated by Charlemagne—leading the adoption of Roman rites over traditional Hispanic liturgy. While northern Christians underwent orthodoxization, southern Mozarabs grew increasingly conservative, preserving ancient Hispanic liturgical traditions. Senior scribes in Mozarab communities produced manuscripts in Visigothic script, maintaining cultural distinction from northern Christians.

The king's military ambitions were covertly undermined by lords fearing they might become the next Alençon. With armies delayed, royal forces were intercepted outside Caen, and Alençon ultimately betrayed Paris. More critically, Hugues VI was wounded by a stray arrow during the Siege of Caen, allowing Lotharingian King Louis VII to invade France, defeat and imprison Hugues VI at Caen.

Hungarians even launched the Bosnian Crusade nominally to eradicate Bogomil heretics, leading to the later Bosnian Church. According to Inquisition investigations, a dualist sect indeed existed in late 15th-century Bosnia, though distinct from the Bosnian Church. Despite universal opposition, Bogomilism remained popular, surviving even after the Second Bulgarian Empire's collapse amid multinational oppression of Bulgarians.\n\nSince Bogomil doctrines advocated overthrowing oppression, and after foreign missionaries localized the teachings, Bogomilism expanded beyond Bulgarians. It gradually reached Ruthenian lands, receiving enthusiastic reception. Ruthenian Rus' people, long oppressed by Mongols and local princes, yearned for liberation. The Zaporizhian Hetmanate, Smolensk Republic, and Turov were all established by Bogomil adherents.\n\nWithin our realm, numerous Bogomil followers oppose many Orthodox doctrines.

During this period, they would conquer new territories, utilize these lands to raise fresh armies, then deploy these forces for further expansion, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\nIn terms of tactics and equipment, the early Ottoman Empire was heavily influenced by military traditions of Central Asian and Middle Eastern nomadic peoples. As an empire developed from nomadic origins, its early forces consisted mainly of Turkmen tribal cavalry. Though professionalization later replaced tribal warriors as the military backbone, the nomadic combat模式 centered on composite bows and cavalry profoundly shaped Ottoman warfare.\n\nRegarding personnel composition, Ottoman soldiers came from diverse sources: the Janissary corps based on military slaves, Sipahi cavalry resembling Western feudal systems, alongside militias, mercenaries, and military volunteers all contributing to the army. The early Ottoman system effectively mobilized all available human resources for conquest.\n\nMuslim peasants could join Yaya units maintaining logistics or serve as mercenaries at the front. Lands were distributed as military fiefs establishing a cavalry system. In newly conquered territories, the Devshirme system conscripted Christian youths who were trained into professional Muslim warriors.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire required continuous territorial expansion to grant military fiefs to meritorious individuals, thereby gaining more soldiers for military campaigns.

Subsequently, it fell under successive Islamic dynasties ruling Persia and Central Asia. In 1258, Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, captured Baghdad, destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate, and established the Mongol Ilkhanate, designating Tabriz as its capital—transforming it into the political, economic, and cultural center. The Maragheh Observatory was constructed nearby, producing the Ilkhanic astronomical tables with its extensive library. During Ghazan Khan's reign, the city became a scholarly hub where Islamic academia flourished, with numerous mosques and religious schools established, making it a center for Shia and Sufi scholarship while serving as a bridge connecting European and Central Asian economies and cultures.

In 1171, after the last Fatimid caliph's death, he dissolved the Fatimid Caliphate and established the Ayyubid Dynasty. Saladin spent the next decade campaigning extensively, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and North African coasts up to Tunisia by 1183. The 1187 Battle of Hattin brought victory over the Kingdom of Jerusalem, though Crusaders soon regained Palestine's coastline.\n\nAfter Saladin's death, his sons contested dynastic control until his brother Al-Adil I ascended the throne in 1200. From the 1250s onward, especially after Mongol dominance in 1260, the dynasty declined rapidly.

This marked the beginning of the era of Delhi Sultanate rule in Northern India.\n\nThe ruling class of the Delhi Sultanate consisted of Islamic military feudal nobles from Central Asia, with the 'Forty Tribes' of Turks and Afghans at their core. They held vast military fiefs known as 'Iqtas' and relied on foreign mercenary armies from Central Asia as the pillar of their rule. They implemented oppressive policies towards Hindu feudal lords and the broader populace, including hostility, discrimination, and persecution, forcibly collecting the jizya tax and compelling conversions to Islam. These actions inflamed the national sentiments and religious emotions of all levels of Hindu society.\n\nNow that Delhi is under our control, some are referring to us as the Sultan of Delhi.

During the 13th to 15th centuries, events like the Mongol invasions plunged Persia and the wider eastern Islamic world into chaos, leading to the gradual decline of the Ghulam system. In the 16th century, with Persia's revival, a new corps was established to counterbalance the growing power of the Qizilbash within the realm, known as the 'King's Friends.' However, this new Ghulam institution differed significantly from its predecessors.

Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad, the ruler of the Ghurids, decisively defeated the Chahamana forces at the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192. His viceroy in India, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, assumed the title of Sultan in 1206, ruling the Muslim-conquered territories of Northern India with Delhi as his capital. From then until the rise of the Mughal Empire, the history of Northern India was essentially the history of the Delhi Sultanate, until its collapse in the mid-15th century, which plunged India into a brief power vacuum.\n\nThe power vacuum left by the dissolution of the Delhi Sultanate did not last long.

Ports such as Bursa in Anatolia and various harbors along the eastern Mediterranean coast became hubs for transactions between Iranian and Italian merchants, with raw silk being Iran's primary export to the West. However, due to the dominance of self-sufficient rural agriculture, inconvenient transportation, and the monopoly of the royal economy, Iran's private commerce long remained small-scale. Persian merchants were mostly engaged in regional goods transport within Iran, lacking comprehensive guild organizations and operating in a decentralized manner, thus playing a minimal role in urban economic and political life. As for long-distance transit trade, it was primarily controlled by Armenian merchants who had settled in Isfahan.\n\nIn 16th-century Iran, the most important handicraft sector was the textile industry, making textile guilds the most influential urban guilds. Other handicraft sectors included ceramics, metalworking, leatherworking, glassmaking, jewelry, dyeing, and papermaking. Some Iranian handicraft products, such as carpets and ceramics, remained renowned in foreign markets—yet this could not conceal the reality of a decline in the commodity economy within the Iranian region. This reflects the comprehensive decline of the Silk Road, resulting in goods previously exchanged along the overland trade routes becoming increasingly difficult to obtain during this period."

The first time I saw him from afar, I recognized he was no true lord. But you, great [Root.Monarch.GetName], all in Hindustan have long heard of your benevolence and wisdom. Your achievements are illustrious in the world, your fame spreads far and wide. The former masters of Samarkand stumble from their horses and flee in panic at the mere mention of your name.

EDG_flavorMUG.3.d:0 "Turkic nobles spread Islam through military conquest, employing far more radical policies than the early Arabs. During the expansion of the Arab Empire, people in conquered lands could retain their faith by paying the jizya poll tax, and the Arabs demonstrated much greater religious tolerance compared to Christian nations. However, the Turkic actions in India were entirely different, marked by widespread slaughter, pillaging, the destruction of Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples, and the forced conversion of infidels to the 'Religion of the Prophet.' Both Buddhism and Hinduism suffered severe blows. While Hinduism, after adaptation and resistance, reached a compromise with the Muslim conquerors and continued to survive and develop, Buddhism ultimately vanished from India due to various internal and external reasons. Islam essentially entered India stepping over the corpse of Buddhism, which consistently faced defeat in most confrontations with Islam. The history of Islam's expansion into Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia is largely a history of encroaching upon and suppressing Buddhism.\n\nThe cruelty of the Turkic conquerors towards Buddhists and Hindus was appalling. Countless Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries were looted, burned to the ground, and mosques erected on their ruins. The religious policies of many Indian Sultanates were highly unenlightened; their religious tolerance was incomplete and reluctant. The Hindu populace bore heavy tax burdens, facing higher rates than Muslims in nearly all taxes besides the jizya. Villages with a mosque could not build new Hindu temples. Hindus held virtually no position within the administrative and judicial systems, barred from high office. In legal disputes, if one party was Muslim, the case was tried under Sharia law, creating an obvious unfairness for non-Muslims.\n\nMore critically, even within the Sultan's direct domains, Islam could not achieve complete dominance under such policies. The entire social structure of India was fundamentally based on Hinduism, especially in the vast rural areas. Without Hinduism, rule could not be maintained, and taxes could not be collected. For the masses of Indian peasants, Hinduism was the religion of their ancestors. Despite its oppressive aspects like the caste system, these tenets were deeply ingrained in the Indian psyche, an inseparable part of their national culture. Converting Indians to Islam proved significantly difficult. This created a profound social schism within the various Sultanates, a rift previously masked by the overwhelming military might of the Muslims but now fully exposed following the decline of the Delhi Sultanate."

The earliest East Slavic chronicle, the 'Primary Chronicle,' from the 12th century, records the origin of 'Kyiv City': the Polianian tribal leaders, three brothers named Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv, jointly 'built a town, and named it Kyiv after their eldest brother.' This occurred around the turn of the 6th-7th centuries, forming the core of the future Kyiv. Kyiv stood at the crossroads of three major trade routes. One was the 'Route from the Varangians to the Greeks' via the Dnieper River, connecting the Baltic region to the Black Sea by water. Another major overland route ran east-west: starting from the Black Sea, passing through Kyiv, Kraków, and Prague, it linked the Arab world with Western Europe. The third trade route began from the Caspian Sea, reached the Baltic via Kyiv, connecting the Arab world with Northern Europe. In 882, the first Rus' state, Kyivan Rus', was established in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 988, the entire city converted to Orthodoxy. Over the next two centuries, it gradually prospered through Eurasian trade, earning the title 'Imperial City on the Dnieper' and becoming the political and religious center of the East Slavs. Even after enduring the brutal Kyivan Rus' civil wars, Kyiv did not decline but quickly rejuvenated, long serving as a holy land for Bogomilist believers and attracting numerous pilgrims.

In the early 12th century, the Principality of Polotsk fragmented into several smaller appanages. The Principality of Minsk was established by a prince of the Polotsk dynasty. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by Kyiv and became a major principality within Kyivan Rus'; however, in 1146, the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivaled Polotsk as the dominant city of the former Polotsk lands. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk struggled for years, attempting to reunite all the lands under Polotsk's rule.

The Bogomilist doctrine, which opposed church authority and the feudal hierarchy, appealed to the lower social strata (peasants, artisans) and some nobles dissatisfied with the Orthodox Church.

EDG_flavorYUA.0.d:0 "Since ancient times, when emperors ruled the world, it has always been China residing at the center to control the barbarians, and the barbarians dwelling outside to serve China. Never has it been heard that barbarians dwelling in China could rule the world. Since the Song dynasty's mandate declined, the Yuan, as northern barbarians, entered and ruled China. All within the Four Seas submitted without exception. Was this by human strength? Truly, it was bestowed by Heaven. At that time, with enlightened rulers and virtuous ministers, they were sufficient to maintain order under heaven. Yet, men of insight and purpose still lamented this inversion of cap and shoe. Thereafter, the ministers and sons of Yuan did not follow their ancestors' teachings, but abandoned and corrupted the fundamental principles. Instances include Emperor Chengzong of Yuan deposing the elder and establishing the younger, Emperor Taiding having a minister murder his sovereign, and Emperor Wenzong having a younger brother poison his elder brother. As for younger brothers taking the wives of elder brothers, and sons claiming the concubines of fathers—superiors and inferiors became accustomed to such acts, complacent and seeing no strangeness in them. Their debasement and chaos in the principles between father and son, ruler and minister, husband and wife, elder and younger, were extreme! The sovereign is the master of the people; the court is the foundation of the world; ritual and righteousness are the great bulwarks governing the age. Their actions being such, how could they serve as instruction for the world and future generations! When their later descendants sank into depravity, losing the Way of ruler and minister, and further added chief ministers monopolizing power, censors harboring grievances, and officials inflicting cruel oppression, then the hearts of the people turned to rebellion, and armed uprisings arose across the land. This caused the people of our China to suffer—the dead with their livers and brains spilled on the ground, the living unable to protect their own flesh and bone. Although this resulted from human affairs, it was indeed the time when Heaven, disgusted with their virtue, cast them aside. The ancients said: 'The northern barbarians' fortune does not last a hundred years.' Examining this today, is it not indeed true?\n\nAt this time, the cycles of Heaven's fortune turn; the vital energy of the Central Plains is strong. Among the millions upon millions, a Sage must descend to drive out the northern barbarians, restore China, establish the guiding principles and regulations, and save this people. Now, more than a decade has passed, yet we have not heard of anyone bringing order and peace to the people. Instead, you are only made to tremble with fear, placed in a situation of shifting allegiances, which is truly pitiable. Currently, in Hebei, Luoyang, Guanzhong, and Shaanxi, there are several powerful leaders: They have forgotten the surnames of their Chinese ancestors and instead adopt the names of barbarian beasts, considering them fine titles. They borrow the Yuan designation to serve their private ends, rely on their followers to coerce the sovereign, act aggressively and arrogantly, and control court authority from afar—these are the He-Luo faction. Others, with few followers and little strength, block passes and occupy strongholds, bribing for noble titles, their aim being to conserve strength and wait for an opportunity—these are the Guan-Shan faction. Both groups initially gained military power under the pretext of capturing 'demon rebels' [the Red Turban leaders]. Once the 'demon rebels' were destroyed and military power obtained, they became arrogant and complacent, no longer having any intention to honor the sovereign or protect the people. They devour each other, instead becoming a great scourge to the people. None are the rightful lords of Huaxia.\n\nI, being urged by the multitude, led troops across the river, occupying the strategic location of Jinling [Nanjing], secured by the natural barrier of the Long River [Yangtze]. Now thirteen years have passed. Reaching west to Ba-Shu [Sichuan], connecting east to the vast sea, controlling south to Min-Yue [Fujian/Guangdong], and incorporating Hu-Guang, Han-Mian, the Huai regions, Xu, and Pi—all have entered the map. Covering the south, all is now under my control. The people are somewhat settled, food is somewhat sufficient, soldiers are somewhat refined. Drawing bows and gripping arrows, I look upon the people of our Central Plains, long without a rightful ruler, and feel deep anguish. I reverently receive the Mandate of Heaven, dare not seek my own ease, and am preparing to dispatch troops north to expel the northern barbarians, rescue the people from utter misery, and restore the dignity of Han officialdom. Fearing the people might not understand and might oppose me as an enemy, fleeing north with their families, sinking deeper into delusion, I therefore issue this proclamation in advance: When the troops arrive, people should not avoid them. My commands are strict and solemn; not the slightest violation will be tolerated. Those who return to me will enjoy eternal peace in China; those who turn from me will flee beyond the frontiers themselves. For the people of our China, Heaven must ordain a person of China to bring them peace—how could barbarians achieve order? I fear the Central Land has long been defiled by their stench, the people distressed and troubled. Therefore, I lead the multitude of heroes to strive vigorously for purification, aiming to expel the northern barbarians, eliminate violence and chaos, ensure the people all find their proper place, and wash away China's shame. Let the people understand this. As for the Mongols and Semu [Central Asian allies of the Mongols], although not of Huaxia lineage, yet born together under Heaven and Earth, those who can understand ritual and righteousness and are willing to be subjects shall be nurtured no differently from the people of Central Xia.

An-Nasir unified Yemen in 1356 and gradually embarked on conquests of surrounding areas. He entered the political power struggles of the Arabian region, filling the local power vacuum. The rule of the Sahada Dynasty was highly decentralized, with various regions retaining significant autonomy, which also facilitated the dynasty's rapid expansion. By 1374, An-Nasir I had become a regional power in Arabia, controlling nearly half of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn 1380, Hajji II, the last Bahri Sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate, was expelled from Cairo. However, the Burji faction failed to quickly stabilize the situation, triggering a civil war within the Mamluk realm. The intense conflict between the factions caused severe damage to Egypt's economy. The Bahri Sultan Hajji II sought assistance from the Sahada Dynasty, promising to cede territories in southwestern Arabia to the Grand Malik An-Nasir I and offer substantial annual tribute. After careful consideration, the 60-year-old An-Nasir I recognized this as the best birthday gift bestowed by Allah. He led his army into Egypt. But after helping the Bahri Sultan suppress the rebellion, An-Nasir I then turned his forces against the Bahri regime itself, ultimately overthrowing the Mamluks and becoming the Sultan of Egypt, establishing a powerful state spanning Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula once again in the world.\n\nHowever, the Sahada Dynasty's rule was highly unstable. While superficially at its zenith, it was in reality precarious. The military nobility within the empire still held immense power; Emirs in regions like Syria possessed great autonomy, and many Arabian tribes continuously sought independence. Since An-Nasir I's death in 1391, the Sahada Dynasty faced persistent rebellions and unrest. The current Sultan of the Sahada Dynasty was the equally astute Muhammad I. Muhammad I was the fourth and only surviving son of An-Nasir I. Endowed with exceptional intelligence from a young age and having accompanied his father on numerous southern and northern campaigns while handling state affairs, he possessed the capability to manage the crises facing the Sahada Dynasty, preventing the already moribund empire from collapsing under its own weight. Yet, after Muhammad's death, the Sahada Empire, in the hands of his successor [From.Monarch.GetName], seemed unsustainable.

One was the spiritual capital, Sana'a, the former capital of the Fatimid Dynasty, said to be the city where Shem, son of Noah, dwelled, where the empire's glorious past is entombed. The other was the head of reality, whose lifeblood was the Nile River. Between these two heads, a narrow, elongated path connected them to the body known as the Empire. This path was both the trade route along the Red Sea coast and a road linking Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem—the three holy cities representing the Prophet's life—symbolizing the empire's splendor and might. But the Sahada Dynasty endured a nightmare. With the end of years of continuous turmoil, the Sahada Dynasty is now riddled with wounds and has lost control over vast territories. Yet, it ultimately survived. As long as a breath remains, we have the chance to stage a comeback."

Transit trade flourished, with merchant caravans arriving in an endless stream. Spices from India, pearls from the Persian Gulf, silk from China, along with slaves, ivory, gold, and exotic animals from East Africa, found vast markets in the Mediterranean world. The southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula and the nearby island of Socotra were famous ancient sources of incense, abundant in frankincense and myrrh. Incense made from frankincense was indispensable for religious sacrifices and court ceremonies, while myrrh was a crucial ingredient for perfumes and many medicines, particularly畅销 in the Mediterranean world. It was from this prosperous base in Yemen that the Sahada Dynasty launched its conquests of Arabia and Egypt. Yemen is our cradle, the land of our dragon's ascent. However, after the Sahada Dynasty moved its capital to Egypt, many powerful figures in Yemen secretly engaged in activities opposing the Sahada rule. Al-Hadi Mutahhar launched a rebellion that swept through Yemen in 1443. Now, another group of Yemeni nobles opposing our rule has raised the banner of revolt against us in the city of Mocha, demanding secession from the empire and the re-establishment of an independent Yemen."

Many Levantine Emirs were also growing restless. To win over several northern vassal Emirs as his support, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to travel to Jerusalem under the pretext of pilgrimage, to hold secret talks there with the Emirs of Fadl, Damascus, and Lebanon. In [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s conception, the Levantine Emirs were subjects at his disposal, but those arrogant Mamluks were, nominally, also his subjects, and they would certainly not dare cause trouble while he was personally present in the Levant. However, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could never have imagined that Muhammad, the leader of the Alexandria Mamluks, had bribed an insignificant valet of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to administer a large dose of strychnine into the fermented grape juice of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s final meal. Just two hours after consuming his last meal, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] experienced full-body convulsions, arched his body into a bow, and died in agony, stripped of all dignity. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s death dealt an even heavier blow to the empire. No one could have anticipated such an event. The Levant lost its final restraint, and the Mamluks in Egypt swiftly launched a power struggle. Muhammad al-Bahri aspired to restore the rule of the Bahri dynasty, while the Mamluks of Jaqmaq al-Burji demanded the establishment of a Mamluk electoral system. The two sides rapidly erupted into civil war. Well-equipped and thoroughly prepared, they were determined to make Egypt's rivers run with blood once more."

EDG_FYM_civil_war.5.d:0 "Nubia, a name long buried by history, left its mark when the throne of Kashtha, King of the Kushite Kingdom, overshadowed ancient cities like Memphis and Thebes. But with the attacks of Aksum, the glorious past of the Kushite Kingdom and Nubia vanished into the rolling waves of the Nile. Although the Nubians lost their kingdom, they did not lose their soul. Rulers of Lower Egypt changed as frequently as a revolving lantern. The Nubians first converted to Christianity, then later to Islam, yet they still used the Greek alphabet to write their language. Their dark skin and unique language remained steadfast through the long river of history. For the Sahada Dynasty, the Nubian region was remote and sparsely populated, its language unintelligible to Arabic speakers, and governance was largely laissez-faire. After all, in the Sultan's eyes, that wilderness held neither value nor threat. For the Nubians, paying tribute to the Egyptians by day was undoubtedly an oppression, and mocking Egyptian decadence was their only way to gain verbal satisfaction.\n\nAn Imam from Wadi Halfa—named Muhammad Yanusi, the most revered Imam in the area—would come to the city's mosque at sunrise every day during Ramadan to preach to the people until sunset. No one in Wadi Halfa, or indeed in all of Nubia, was held in higher esteem. His duties as a cleric were not yet over when his duties as a leader abruptly arrived.\n\nDue to the occlusion of information, the Sultan's tax decree and the news of the empire's turmoil reached Wadi Halfa almost simultaneously. One evening, before the Maghrib prayer, Imam Yanusi heard the news. The Imam pondered for a long time. Under a starry and moonlit night, he opened the Quran, which he had read countless times, and his gaze settled on this page:\n\n'Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah. But if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do.'"

Upon hearing the news of their employer's death and the withheld pay, most of the local garrisons scattered like birds and beasts. The meticulously maintained Red Sea route and pilgrimage path were immediately overrun with Bedouin who seemed to sprout from the desert itself. Mecca, Medina, Aden, and Sana'a were crowded with residents seeking refuge, and the order across the peninsula vanished in an instant.\n\nFaced with the chaos engulfing the Arabian Peninsula, the Holy Cities became a guiding beacon. The Sharif of Hejaz, the leader of the Quraysh tribe, a descendant of Ali, Abu al-Qasim Hashim, sent a personal letter to the Sheikhs across the peninsula. To ensure delivery, three different couriers were dispatched to carry the same message to each Sheikh. Even so, Imam Rashid only received one letter; the other two fell to the scimitars of the Bedouin.\n\nIn the letter, the leader Abu, in the name of the Hashim family—that is, as a descendant of the Prophet—endorsed them, granting the various Sheikhs the authority to govern their own territories. He called on all parties to cease their confrontations and focus on managing their own domains, for he understood that the Sheikhs of this peninsula would not relinquish their hard-won autocratic power. He hoped this letter would quell the immediate chaos, but could the fires of war on the peninsula truly be smothered by a mere sheet of thin paper?"

Ahmad learned from a young age to don the cloak of humility, making himself appear non-threatening among the Mamluks and other military nobles, yet deep inside, he harbored burning ambition. In his early years, Ahmad followed Muhammad I on campaigns north and south. He was deeply impressed by this brave and wise Sultan, knowing full well he could never surpass his sovereign, and resigned himself to serving faithfully for the remainder of Muhammad's life.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad I, Ahmad Rosetta spent several years cautiously observing his new liege lord. Finally confirming the possibility of his grand designs, Ahmad began secretly building his own power base. Highly respected and with illustrious military achievements, he became a figure whom both the Bahri and Burji factions were willing to compromise with and obey.

EDG_flavorAEL.1.d:0 "The two Albigensian Crusades have left everlasting memories of suffering upon this land. The ambitions of the King of France have long threatened our security. Advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] have proposed an idea: to establish stronger fortifications in Lyon and Narbonne, thereby defending against threats from the north."

EDG_flavorAEL.2.d:0 "As the number of True Believers gradually increases, it is necessary for us to further standardize the management of our followers. We must convene our first council in our holy city of Aix—the Eighth Ecumenical Council of the Orthodox Faith—to discuss church affairs and establish order. The council gathered numerous Cathar scholars and reached a unanimous conclusion: Catharism must gather under the banner of [Root.GetName] to maintain its independence."

EDG_flavorAEL.3.d:0 "Bernard VI de Ventadour was one of the leaders of the Cathar faith during the Albigensian Crusade. The origins of the Count of Albi trace back to the famous troubadour Bernard de Ventadour from southern France. He once served at the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine and fell in love with the Duchess. Historically, heartbroken after the Duchess married into the English royalty, he entered a monastery and composed numerous sorrowful songs. In this timeline, we assume he overcame his heartbreak, wandered to the County of Toulouse, married a handmaiden of Raymond II, and became a court troubadour for Raymond VI.\n\nWhen the Albigensian Crusade erupted, Bernard's son William 'the Fire' volunteered for the Count's forces. At the decisive Battle of Salecran, he led his troops to set fire to the French king's supplies and provisions, earning him the epithet 'the Fire.' William was later granted the title of Albi, becoming William I of Albi. After Toulouse was formally crowned as a kingdom, the Ventadour family was naturally elevated to Counts. Due to Albi's strategic importance and the Ventadour family's longstanding influence, they hold a significant position within the Arles court.\n\nAs our war preparations become increasingly complete, the current Count of Albi, Bernard VIII de Ventadour, requests to contribute his strength to the holy war."

EDG_flavorAEL.4.d:0 "On a beautiful Monday, numerous Cathar scholars gathered in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Cathedral was filled with an assembly of brilliant minds; no meeting in the past millennium could have gathered so many wise souls. The scholars convened another conference on Cathar doctrine, proposing that not all people are obstinate—the Gospel of God alone can surely make all mortals convert devoutly. We also hope that some may join our ranks. The scholars unanimously agreed that the church of [Root.GetAdjective], after years of development, has attracted the world's attention, and [Root.GetAdjective]'s [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undoubtedly become the leader of the Cathar world. The conference suggested that [Root.GetAdjective] should unite all Cathar nations, letting the voice of Christ spread across Europe."

EDG_flavorAEL.5.d:0 "Since the 13th century, Avignon has gradually developed into another religious center for Catharism besides Aix. With the gradual renovation and expansion of the Avignon Church, it has attracted an increasing number of pilgrims. The scale of the great church is now incomparable to its initial state. Today, the magnificent Avignon Church attracts countless scholars and pilgrims, showcasing the advancement of Catharism."

EDG_flavorAEL.6.d:0 "The Milan Cathedral in Italy shines brilliantly in the northern Italian region, capable of hosting religious activities for 40,000 people. Its construction began in 1386 AD and was not completed until 1485 AD. This cathedral is entirely built of white marble, with a hall 59 meters wide, 130 meters long, and a central vault reaching a maximum height of 45 meters. The cathedral's distinctive feature lies in its exterior: pointed arches, pilasters, and traceried windows, with 135 spires resembling a dense forest of towers piercing the sky, each spire crowned with a statue of a saint. The exterior of the church boasts over 2,000 statues, making it quite unique. Including interior statues, there are more than 6,000 in total, making it the Gothic church with the most statues in the world. Consequently, the architecture appears extraordinarily ornate and vibrant, possessing a secular atmosphere. The church features a spire reaching 107 meters high, the work of the 15th-century Italian architectural master Filippo Brunelleschi. At the pinnacle stands a golden statue of the Virgin Mary, radiant under the sunlight, both miraculous and magnificent."

EDG_flavorAEL.7.d:0 "Genoa... In Italian, it is called Genova, and was once called Zena, which in Arabic means 'a beautiful city.' It is located in northern Italy. During the Middle Ages, the city was called Janua. In Latin, 'janua' means 'portal' or 'gateway.' It refers not only to a door panel hinged to open and close but also to the threshold and exit separating a person's enclosed dwelling from the boundless universe. Thus, Janua is not just a portal; it is the exit to a new day, the threshold from yesterday to tomorrow; it is a gaze fixed on the future while simultaneously looking back at the past. Genoa is an ancient city with a very long history. Long before the founding of Rome, the Ligurians already inhabited the area. It was once an administrative region of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it fell into Byzantine hands, was subsequently occupied by the Lombards and the Franks, and later, the Republic of Genoa was established here, becoming one of the most active powers in the Mediterranean. This lasted until Genoa came under the control of the House of Savoy, rendering the republican system nominal. However, Genoa's substantial citizen class has continuously struggled both internally and externally. Now that we control prosperous Genoa, its vast citizen class requests autonomous privileges for the city. Its fate rests in our hands."

EDG_flavorAEL.8.d:0 "Although our nation has largely converted to the True Faith, some stubborn elements still secretly cling to their false beliefs, hoping for the return of their false king and false pope. Some scholars argue that we should continue to support our newly established papacy to further the enlightenment of our people and the world."

EDG_flavorAEL.10.d:0 "Since the first ecumenical councils, the Bishop of Rome has gradually acquired a status that was never rightfully his. The so-called Pope in Rome is merely a guise the Roman Bishop has donned for himself. As our faith has gradually expanded, the disguise of the false pope has been torn away. The authority of the Catholic Church in the Holy Roman Empire has dissipated like ashes under the illumination of the Albigensian Gospel, and the Christian world has placed all its hopes upon Catharism."
EDG_flavorAEL.11.d:0 "How long has the Roman Papacy existed? It seems so long that we have lost track of time. It feels as though it was there at the world's birth, that the world was meant to function this way, that the Church was meant to serve Rome as its master—so natural. We will tell the world that nothing is born this way, nothing is inherently meant to be this way. Rome's special status is not one it deserved, nor does it have the right to continue holding it. The Roman Bishop and the Roman Church shall return to their proper place."
EDG_flavorAEL.12.d:0 "The authority of the King of France vanished completely with the failures of the two Albigensian Crusades. Yet, someone must become the King of the Franks. Now, looking across the lands of Western Europe, only we have the capability to take up the crown of Charlemagne and become the suzerain of all princes."
EDG_flavorAEL.13.d:0 "As one of the largest principalities within the Empire, Franconia holds extraordinary influence and representativeness. Successive Dukes of Franconia have long maintained a special relationship with the King of Arles, as we share a common ancestral lineage with Arles.

EDG_flavorAEL.14.d:0 "The Republic of Piedmont shares a deep friendship with the Kingdom of Arles.

He helps those in need and shares his faith with others. $HEIR$'s piety has long been recognized by many Cathar believers, but this devotion has also brought about a significant change. The Gospel of God has convinced $HEIR$ that he should enter a monastery for the remainder of his life, which would, however, create a succession crisis for the kingdom."
EDG_flavorAEL.18.d:0 "As Catharism gradually permeates the Empire, more and more princes have begun to embrace the faith. The Holy Roman Emperor can no longer stem the Cathar tide. At the most recent Imperial Diet, the princes demanded that Catharism become the official religion of the Empire. Although the Emperor maintains an unyielding stance, the truthful power of Christ's Gospel is a force the Emperor cannot oppose."

Their ancestors started their fortune by trading olive oil and dyes, eventually monopolizing the trade routes from Barcelona to Orléans. During the First Albigensian Crusade, although they suffered significant economic losses, the Reghena family weathered the crisis thanks to the wealth accumulated over generations, while their competitors either went bankrupt or were forced into exile. Jérôme, the third patriarch of the Reghena family, successfully forged connections with the royal court. He not only secured the substantial court textile contracts but also became the primary financier for the monarchy. As the Cathar influence gradually took root, and with the support of successive Kings of Arles, by around 1440, the Reghena family's commercial network spanned the entire South of France and extended into Catalonia and Piedmont, all while consistently serving the Arles royal house. Recently, due to the positive development of the domestic economy, the Reghena family has offered us their support."

EDG_flavorSMO.0.d:0 "The Republic of Smolensk was established in 1407 when the local merchant Veche council overthrew the tyrannical Rurikid prince and founded a Veche Republic. However, the Veche still maintained a repressive domestic policy, treating the nation's agriculture and handicrafts as their own colony and exploiting peasants and lower-class artisans to the extreme, ultimately leading to an uprising by freeholders and townspeople. The rebelling peasants and citizens formed an alliance later named the United Front. After overthrowing the merchant Veche, the freeholders and citizens established a government that rejected the nobility and formed a Hundred-Member Council.\n\nYet, the nascent Republic of Smolensk failed to completely expel the nobility; even the Republican Council contained numerous conservative elements. They exercised power on behalf of the peasants yet possessed vast wealth and held extensive lands. Leveraging their economic strength, the conservatives and remnants of the nobility continuously expanded their political influence and gradually dominated the council.\n\nThe power of the Republic's Consul soon swelled to an overwhelming extent. Representatives willing to speak for the lower classes in the Hundred-Member Council became few and far between. The laws provided almost no protection for peasants and lower-class artisans; instead, they granted more and more privileges to large landowners and wealthy merchants. Tenant farmers who lost their land and could not pay rent were sold into slavery; lower-class artisans injured at work had to pay substantial compensation to their employers to cover the cost of machinery and lost time. The military government colluded with wealthy merchants, shielding each other, exchanging favors, and jointly oppressing the broad masses of peasants and artisans.\n\nThe military government maintained a high-pressure internal policy, causing immense suffering among the lower classes. Anyone critical of the military government was secretly arrested. Smolensk's peasants sarcastically remarked, 'Why is the government angry? We merely stated what they have done.' Yet, externally, the military government was weak and ineffective. In 1433, the republic lost half its territory in a war against the Prince of Chernigov, and the most proactive action the military government took during the war was to suppress 'traitors' within the country who discussed the government's strategic failures.\n\nIn 1440, Yuri Rostislavich became the Republic's Consul and further tightened the exploitation of the lower masses. He decreed that peasants whose land was requisitioned must pay administrative fees to the government, and citizens conscripted into the army must pay management fees to the military. The Rurikid princes lacked such imagination, but during Yuri's tenure, he managed 'to have his cake and eat it too,' selling large numbers of peasants into slavery while also demanding they pay a 'freedom tax.' Although the military government's oppressive rule cast a terrifying shadow over the republic, seemingly suppressing all discontent, everyone understood that a storm was brewing."

The peasant leader Aleksei became their hope and leader; they believed only through uprising could they change their fate.\n\nHowever, on the eve of the peasant uprising, Aleksei suddenly passed away. All peasants and artisans were plunged into deep mourning, feeling they had lost a great leader and mentor.\n\nAt Aleksei's funeral, the peasants and artisans bid farewell to their leader with the most devout prayers. But the uprising had to continue. They had to keep fighting for their rights and dignity, to keep resisting the military government.\n\nThe Consul continued to brutally suppress the peasants, making their lives even harder. Many peasants were imprisoned for treason. Yet, Aleksei's death only strengthened their resolve to overthrow the military government. They launched a massive uprising aimed at toppling the regime and re-establishing a just republic.\n\nAlthough Aleksei was gone, his spirit and ideals lived on in the peasants' hearts. Anton took up the banner of rebellion and led the peasants in continuing the fight. They would struggle to achieve their rights and dignity. They knew this uprising was not just for themselves, but for all who suffered oppression and injustice. They would fight for justice and equality until final victory."

However, under the guidance of sound policies and hands-on leadership, the people embarked on an arduous reconstruction effort. The republican government expanded infrastructure, vigorously developed irrigation projects, distributed land equitably, and encouraged peasants to engage in agricultural production, thereby boosting their motivation and enthusiasm. Smolensk's agricultural production gradually embarked on the path to recovery. The peasants' hard work yielded bountiful harvests, with large quantities of grain and other agricultural products exported to external markets, generating substantial economic benefits for the nation. Famine vanished from the people's tables, and the republic regained its prosperity."
EDG_flavorSMO.5.d:0 "On a cold winter day, Gerasim Marozov was born in a remote village of Smolensk. All the land in Marozov's village belonged to high-ranking officials of the military government, which brutally exploited the local peasants. From a young age, Gerasim witnessed the suffering and oppression endured by the peasants. Once, for confronting an official of the military government, he was hung at the village entrance, severely beaten, and left hanging upside down throughout the freezing night, nearly freezing to death by the next morning.\n\nUpon reaching adulthood, he joined the local insurgent organization and participated in numerous actions against the military government. As an exceptional fighter, Gerasim quickly became one of the leaders within the organization, earning the respect and trust of many. In a particularly dangerous operation, Gerasim led his team into a village controlled by the enemy, successfully rescuing hundreds of detained peasants and defeating the enemy forces. This victory not only boosted the peasants' morale but also struck fear into the enemy.\n\nUnder his leadership, more and more peasants joined the resistance. Although they often faced brutal suppression and persecution from the enemy, they remained steadfast and pressed on until they ultimately achieved victory in the Second Uprising. Gerasim Marozov became a symbol of the revolution and a hero to the people. His bravery and selfless spirit inspired generation after generation to continue fighting for the nation's freedom and dignity."

However, over time, some internal problems emerged within Smolensk.\n\nAt a certain point, some reactionary nobles and wealthy merchants began conspiring to resist the peasant republic's government and sought external forces to support them. They believed Smolensk's current system was erroneous and evil and that the original monarchy and aristocracy should be restored.\n\nThese reactionary elements secretly began recruiting supporters, planning violent actions, and attempting to overthrow the republic. They spread rumors and propaganda, incited popular discontent, and exploited economic crises and other social issues to expand their influence.\n\nIn $YEAR$, a group of old nobles set foot on Smolensk soil once more and, allied with domestic reactionary forces, launched a rebellion.

This was a critical moment determining the future survival of the republic. The leader of the dictatorial military government, Grand Marshal Yuri, threatened the security of the republic's capital and proposed a deal: to take all the wealth of the elites and establish an independent principality within Smolensk. This caused an uproar within the peasant militias.\n\nRepresentatives arrived from every corner; they were ordinary peasants and artisans, but they knew they had the right and duty to defend their homeland. After the session began, Chairman Anton Petrov delivered a passionate speech that inspired everyone present. He declared that they must stand up to defend the unity and integrity of this land.\n\nSubsequently, every representative voiced their opinions and views. They unanimously agreed that safeguarding the nation's territorial integrity was the responsibility of every citizen. A heavy atmosphere hung over the assembly hall, but the representatives did not retreat. They resolved to take action, defending their government at all costs.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of intense debate and voting, the representatives passed a resolution announcing the establishment of a National Military-Administrative Committee, responsible for maintaining national security and territorial integrity, with Anton Petrov serving as its Chairman. This decision received the support and endorsement of all present.\n\nThis small nation faced immense challenges, but its people were willing to confront everything. They understood their responsibilities and duties, believing that united, they could overcome all difficulties. This historic decision of the Smolensk Republic's National Peasant State Congress would be forever engraved in people's hearts. It not only demonstrated the strong will of this nation's people but also became a beacon of freedom and equality."

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.1.d:0 "Smolensk is undoubtedly an agriculturally-based society, where agricultural production plays a vital role in socio-economic development. The turmoil caused by the old nobility during the Second Uprising resulted in significant damage to production: fertile fields were trampled by rebel armies, and many farming households became homeless refugees. Restoring the economy has become an imperative for the republic's continued progress. To promote economic recovery, representatives convened the Fifth National State Conference in $YEAR$.\n\nFurthermore, the conference emphasized not only the need to restore the economy and develop production but also stressed the crucial importance of ensuring shared prosperity for all. They were determined not to let political and economic resources flow disproportionately to any single class, thereby preventing the fruits of the uprising's victory from being seized once again by the powerful.\n\nDuring the conference, peasant representative Mikhail Tolishnev delivered a passionate speech:\n\n'Dear compatriots, respected fellow countrymen and comrades! It is true that we have achieved victory now, and this is cause for celebration. But we must never forget that we achieved an identical victory 40 years ago, only to have the fruits of that victory stolen by Yuri and his cronies!\n\n'After the previous uprising ended, due to our lack of oversight in the resource distribution process, privileged classes represented by Yuri appropriated our social resources. Through various legal yet cruel means, they seized our land and stripped us of our power, leading to extreme wealth disparity.\n\n'They gained control over the majority of the nation's resources through various methods, enjoying high incomes and superior living conditions, while ordinary people could only earn meager wages through hard labor and toil. Some even struggled to secure basic food and shelter. Although our uprising succeeded the first time, we failed to protect its gains, allowing the nation to be taken over once again by cruel elites!\n\n'Finally, I hope everyone can recognize the root cause of this problem—that we failed to establish an effective system for monitoring power and turned a blind eye to the growing wealth gap! If we are to prevent our hard-won victory from being stolen again, we must ensure common prosperity and work together to change this. We need to build a just and transparent social system, guaranteeing equal opportunities and rights for everyone. We must dismantle the old privileged class structure, enabling all to achieve success through their own efforts, with no one able to monopolize social resources through unjust means. Only then can our society become more just, equal, and free, securing a better life and future for all of us.'\n\nMikhail's speech was met with thunderous applause. Undoubtedly, this conference will become a significant milestone in Smolensk's history. However, whether the conference's resolutions can be genuinely implemented and its spirit faithfully carried forward still faces uncertainty."

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.2.d:0 "Although the Republic has existed for a long time, its peasants still find themselves facing many hardships. In this era, they are no longer oppressed or exploited, yet they still lack basic rights and freedoms. The Tenth National Congress is precisely a gathering dedicated to exploring solutions to these issues.\n\nAt the congress, the peasants raised many demands. First, they continue to demand economic development to alleviate their poverty. They believe that by improving agricultural production and promoting the growth of manufacturing, more employment opportunities can be created and peasants' incomes can be increased.\n\nIn addition to economic development, the peasants also hope to achieve cultural prosperity and political enlightenment. They consider education essential and recommend that the government establish more church schools so that everyone may receive an education.\n\nMoreover, in light of the extravagant corruption and arbitrary behavior displayed by certain bureaucrats, they also call for continued government transparency, improved oversight over officials, and guarantees that everyone may enjoy equal rights and opportunities.\n\nA representative named Vasiliy Konstantinovich delivered the following speech:\n\n\"We peasants toil tirelessly and contribute greatly to the nation, yet our interests are often neglected and infringed upon by certain bureaucrats. They tend to care only about their own private gains while turning a blind eye to our suffering. They frequently require us to comply with all sorts of strange rules and regulations, leaving us troubled and powerless.\n\n\"At the same time, the corruption of certain officials has brought us great distress and harm. They often abuse their power, accept bribes, and even suppress dissenters and critics. Such actions fill us with deep indignation. Their behavior has already gravely undermined the interests of both the state and the people and must be thoroughly reformed and corrected.\n\n\"Therefore, on behalf of the broad peasant masses, I call upon the Republican government to take action—strengthen oversight and management of the bureaucracy, severely punish corrupt officials, and safeguard the lawful rights of the people. We hope that one day we peasants may truly enjoy the respect and treatment we deserve, becoming an indispensable force in the nation's construction.\"\n\nThe peasants' demands reflect the people's pursuit of fairness, justice, and freedom. They also remind us that at all times, the voices and needs of the people must be heard and respected."


EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.3.d:0 "At the Fourteenth People's Assembly of the Republic, delegates discussed how to build an efficient government to enhance management capabilities in five key areas: production, administration, judiciary, military, and civil affairs.\n\nIn the realm of production, delegates argued that to increase efficiency, it was necessary to adopt new agricultural and handicraft technologies and methods. They also emphasized strengthening the management and protection of farmland and cultivated land, preventing land consolidation, ensuring that tillers have their own land, and strictly prohibiting the emergence of new feudal lords.\n\nIn the administrative sphere, the government needs to establish an effective administrative structure to make policy formulation and implementation more efficient and just. Furthermore, delegates called on the government to increase its focus on villages, urging leaders from various departments to engage at the grassroots level to understand the real conditions in both urban and rural areas.\n\nIn the judicial field: Building an efficient government requires improving the judicial system, including refining the legal framework and strengthening oversight of judicial procedures. Additionally, efforts to combat criminal activities should be intensified to maintain social order and security.\n\nIn the military domain, establishing an efficient government necessitates building a strong military force to defend national territory and people's safety. Moreover, training and management of soldiers should be enhanced to improve the army's combat effectiveness and operational efficiency. More importantly, ensuring equality among personnel within the National Army and in resource distribution, as well as efficient mobilization, is crucial.\n\nIn civil affairs, the government needs to address social welfare issues, ensuring proper care for the elderly without family and orphans. Expanding church schools to elevate the knowledge level of the populace is also a top priority.\n\nThroughout the process of building an efficient government, the people's representatives believed that the focus should remain on the interests of the state and its people, adhering to laws and regulations, and committing to advancing the nation's economic, political, and social development."

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.4.d:0 "At the Twenty-Second People's Assembly of the Republic, there was fervent discussion on the importance of promoting the revolutionary spirit, the heroic spirit, the spirit of practice, and the scientific spirit.\n\nFirst, the delegates deemed the revolutionary spirit absolutely essential. They believed that only through continuous change and revolution can societal progress be driven forward. Every individual, they argued, should embrace revolutionary ideals and use their own strength to advance social development. Second, the heroic spirit was also widely debated. They held that figures such as soldiers who fight bravely, clergy and healers who make sacrifices, and leaders who guide the people to victory are all worthy of emulation. The heroic spirit they embody should serve as our model. The spirit of practice was another topic of discussion at this assembly. They asserted that we must not remain solely at the theoretical level but should take action, applying theoretical knowledge to practice. Only through practice can we better master knowledge and skills and achieve greater success. Finally, the scientific spirit received significant attention. They considered science a vital force driving social development and believed that only through continuous exploration and innovation can we make constant progress. They called on people to embrace a pioneering and enterprising spirit, daring to explore and seek solutions to unresolved problems, thereby better serving society.\n\nRepresentative Mikhail, filled with righteous indignation, vehemently criticized the prevailing atmosphere of extravagance, debauchery, and corruption within the republic: 'It is not hard to see that many undesirable trends exist in our current society. Some chase luxury and pleasure, forgetting their responsibilities and mission; others engage in corruption, depriving the masses of their interests; still others act arrogantly and tyrannically, showing no respect for others' lives and rights. These vile phenomena have plunged the entire society into crisis and must be taken seriously by every one of us. In response, I believe we need to practice the heroic spirit and the revolutionary spirit. The heroic spirit refers to qualities of bravery, fearlessness, and self-sacrifice. Only those who possess these qualities can step forward in difficult times to protect justice and fairness in society. The revolutionary spirit, meanwhile, refers to the drive for continuous change and progress. Only those with a revolutionary spirit can propel society steadily forward. I am confident that all delegates and friends present here possess the ability to practice both the heroic and revolutionary spirits. We must keep our mission and responsibilities in mind, placing the public interest above personal gain, and lead by example. Only in this way can we build a truly beautiful, just, and equal society. Finally, I hope we can unite and jointly practice the heroic and revolutionary spirits. Let us strive together to build a society that is more beautiful, vibrant, and full of opportunities!'"

Among these, the fundamental stances included 'Promoting Democracy, Respecting Rights,' 'Seeking Equality, Opposing Oppression,' and others. Basic viewpoints encompassed 'Collective Wisdom, Joint Deliberation,' 'Mutual Respect, Reaching Consensus,' and similar principles. Core methodologies included tenets such as 'Free Debate, Not Excluding Dissenting Opinions' and 'Openness and Transparency, Avoiding Partiality to Private Interests.'\n\nDuring the assembly, peasant representatives extensively solicited opinions from all sides and debated numerous critical issues, such as land use, tax distribution, and political rights. On these topics, adhering to the fundamental stances, basic viewpoints, and core methodologies, they engaged in intense yet constructive debates, ultimately reaching unanimous agreements.\n\nAfter the assembly concluded, the peasant representatives compiled the meeting records into documents and disseminated the spirit of the assembly to all peasants, helping them better understand and support the reforms. This People's Assembly not only fully demonstrated the wisdom and unity of the peasants but also injected new momentum into the republic's development.\n\nIn summary, regardless of the era, democracy, equality, freedom, and justice are the fundamental values pursued by humanity.

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.6.d:0 "Due to the fluctuating political situation within the republic in recent years and the expanding privileges of various social strata, significant resentment towards bureaucrats and wealthy merchants has accumulated domestically. Privileged classes have monopolized social resources, with a small minority of the wealthy and powerful enjoying superior treatment, while the ordinary populace remains at a disadvantage. This inequality has a profound impact on society, increasing the risk of cumulative effects and social instability. At the Thirty-Second People's Assembly convened by the republic, peasant representatives unanimously demanded adherence to equality and opposition to oppression.\n\nAt the start of the session, the peasant leader Aleksei angrily accused: 'First, I must address the corruption within the republican government. Government officials exploit their power for personal gain, even resorting to any means necessary. Disregarding the people's sentiments and interests, they appropriate public resources for themselves. This behavior has become a chronic malady in our society. We cannot tolerate this situation continuing and must stand up to stop such abuse of power and acceptance of bribes.\n\n"Second, the monopoly of social resources by the privileged classes is also an issue we must focus on. The wealthy and powerful enjoy preferential treatment, while ordinary citizens remain disadvantaged. The impact of this inequality on society is extremely pernicious. We must shatter this phenomenon of inequality.\n\n"Finally, I must denounce the republican laws as being mere empty words. Laws guide the operation of our entire society, yet we find that some individuals can evade punishment through bribery and other means, while ordinary people face severe penalties. This shocking reality shows that our laws are utterly failing to fulfill their proper role of protecting the people.'\n\nMany other representatives also rushed to speak: 'We are equal! No one is more important or has more rights than another.' This declaration received enthusiastic applause from numerous attendees from the lower classes. However, many representatives of bureaucrats and wealthy merchants seated in the assembly hall watched with cold disdain, silently cursing these ungrateful paupers and lazy swine for roaring in the public hall due to their own lack of effort.\n\nThe participants also expressed dissatisfaction with certain unfair policies and practices. They condemned those bureaucrats and merchants who exploited the peasants and called for the enactment of fairer laws."

Numerous Bogomilist scholars convened a council in Kyiv aimed at demanding the abolition of the Orthodox Church. The Bogomilist believers argued that their faith was closer to the true teachings of Christianity, while Orthodoxy had become outdated and corrupt. They contended that Orthodox rituals and dogmatic systems had strayed from the genuine spirit of Christianity and had become tools of the ruling class, depriving the people of their freedom and rights. The council called upon the Bogomilist faithful to overthrow Orthodox lords and convert to the true faith."

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.9.d:0 "In $YEAR$, Bogomilist scholars held the famous Grand Council of Moscow in Moscow.

They considered these groups irredeemable criminals who must be eradicated to purify Christianity."
EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.10.d:0 "Due to the economic development in the Rus' region, merchants have amassed substantial profits from social production, leading affluent lives. These wealthy merchants typically operated large-scale agricultural and handicraft industries, which were highly profitable sectors at the time. These successful merchants often possessed vast lands and enterprises, enabling them to enjoy luxurious residences and employ numerous servants. They also indulged in collecting precious items such as jewelry, porcelain, textiles, and more. Affluent merchants flaunted their wealth at social gatherings, wearing exquisite clothing and accessories, savoring fine food and wine, while engaging in dance and conversation with people from other social strata. Many peasant representatives viewed these merchants as a significant source of decadence and corruption, arguing that if these extravagant and corrupt wealthy merchants were not suppressed, our nation would inevitably slide back into decay."

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.11.d:0 "For a long time, the great nobles possessed vast estates from which they derived enormous incomes. Their lives were marked by extravagance and corruption, living in a manner of squandering money like dirt, frequently hosting grand banquets and social events in their luxurious manors or castles.\n\nThese great nobles often used their power and influence to satisfy their personal desires. They reveled in squeezing the people's wealth and marrow. For instance, if a serf broke a wooden plow, the noble might have him hung in the center of the courtyard and brutally beaten, all while admiring his collection of jewelry, artworks, and antiquities, displaying these expensive items in his manor or castle. They focused intensely on personal image and etiquette, wearing the most fashionable clothes and accessories to display their status and wealth, while their serfs shivered in the cold wind, clad in rags barely sufficient for covering.\n\nThe Boyars controlled vast lands and properties and wielded immense influence, enabling them to interfere in political and economic decisions to acquire more wealth and privileges. This injustice and corruption ultimately led to social unrest and growing discontent.\n\nIn $YEAR$, [Root.GetAdjective] achieved the restoration of order in the Rus' region. As a peasant republic, the [Root.GetAdjective] government clearly would not treat the existing nobility in the old ways.

EDG_flavorSMO_Mission.13.d:0 "The Bryansk Conference convened in $YEAR$. Some delegates argued that it was the optimal time to expand the peasant revolution. They pointed out that as the chaos in the Rus' lands intensified, the exploitation and oppression of peasants and artisans by feudal lords were worsening. Heavy taxes and policies that deprived peasants of their land made their lives increasingly difficult. These oppressed masses would support the republic's revolution and join our cause. Conversely, failure to act would allow the plight of our peasant compatriots to deteriorate further.\n\nOther delegates held a more conservative stance. They emphasized that the current situation was perilous; expanding the peasant revolution could lead to more violence and bloodshed. More importantly, the republic's strength was still frail, while the Grand Prince of Moscow was at the peak of his power. They argued that we could not confront all feudal lords simultaneously."

Our merchants and missionaries abroad are constantly being executed, and our international reputation is becoming increasingly tarnished. Some believe that declaring war on the Grand Prince of Moscow is necessary and urgent. They argue that without taking firm action, the Grand Prince is likely to complete the formation of a reactionary front and pose an even greater threat to Smolensk in the future.\n\nOthers oppose this view. They contend that the Grand Prince of Moscow, as our former suzerain, still possesses significant power. Rashly initiating war against him would be unwise and could lead to substantial losses and casualties. They recommend resolving the issue through diplomatic means, proposing the release of the reactionary nobles we have arrested to appease foreign aristocratic forces, or at least delaying any decision to await more information and subsequent developments.\n\nIf we issue a challenge to the Grand Prince of Moscow, we will demand large territories inhabited by our compatriots. Should the Grand Prince refuse, we will immediately declare war."

EDG_flavorSCO.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Scotland and the War of the Nobles"
EDG_flavorSCO.0.d:0 "Although Scotland was far inferior to its southern rival, England, in both land and population, successive English kings relentlessly attempted to infiltrate Scotland. In 1250, King Alexander III of Scotland married Margaret, daughter of John III, who demanded Alexander pay homage and tribute. Alexander III refused vehemently. Alexander and Margaret's daughter married King Eric II of Norway, and they had a daughter, Princess Margaret, known as the 'Maid of Norway.' In 1275, Queen Margaret of Scotland passed away. In need of a male heir, Alexander III married Yolande de Dreux as his second wife. However, while visiting his new queen, Alexander III died after falling from a cliff during a night journey. The 'Maid of Norway' Margaret became Alexander III's legal heir, but at that time, the young queen was not only in Norway but also only five years old—in other words, Scotland had lost its king. Had the young Margaret lived to adulthood and personally sat upon the Stone of Scone to become King of Scotland, Scottish history might have been different. But four years later, news of the young queen's death in Norway reached Caledonia, immediately stirring a storm in Scotland.\n\nIn 1290, with the death of Margaret, the 'Maid of Norway,' the Scottish throne officially became vacant. Two main competing families emerged: the Balliols and the Bruces. After the Scottish throne fell vacant, the Balliols and Bruces began vying for the right of succession. To resolve this issue, Scottish nobles, clergy, and representatives of the people convened a historic assembly in 1291. This assembly, held at Perth Castle in eastern Scotland, was known as the 'Convention of Perth.' Representatives from across Scotland engaged in intense debate and voting, attempting to find a suitable heir for the throne. Over several weeks, after careful consideration and deliberation, the representatives ultimately selected John Balliol and Robert Bruce as the two most likely candidates to become King of Scotland. To avoid another succession crisis, the representatives decided to establish an electoral system, with the former Steward of the Royal Household, the Stewart family, serving as conveners. According to the new regulations, future Kings of Scotland would be elected by the nobility and clergy together, rather than simply inherited by the royal heir. This decision became a milestone in Scottish history, laying the foundation for the future Scottish political system.\n\nAt the Convention of Perth, the Scottish people demonstrated their wisdom, resolve, and determination. By establishing an electoral system, they ensured the legitimacy and stability of future Scottish kings, laying a solid foundation for Scotland's independence and development. However, the vacancy of the Scottish throne also attracted the attention of another uninvited guest—the English King Edward I to the south. Shortly after the Convention of Perth, King Edward I of England intervened in the Scottish succession issue, attempting to use his power and influence to pressure Scottish nobles and clergy. However, his intervention did not gain Scottish acceptance or support. Ultimately, through the firm resistance of the Scottish people, Edward I's interference failed. His actions instead fueled Scottish nationalism, strengthening the unity and resolve of the Scottish people. The Scottish people not only defended their right to succession but also safeguarded their autonomy and independence. Although Edward I ultimately failed to claim the Scottish throne, his actions heightened tensions between England and Scotland and injected new momentum into the Scottish independence movement. From then on, the Scottish people began building a stronger national consciousness and self-identity on their own soil, laying the groundwork for the independence movement in Scottish history. Initially, only the Bruce and Balliol families participated in the election, but as the de Umfraville family of Northumbria gradually established themselves in northern England, this family also became a potential claimant to the Scottish throne.\n\nScotland, situated in the northwestern corner of the known world, enjoyed a geographical position that ironically provided better development prospects. The English nobility to the south no longer bowed to the crown, whereas the Scottish crown was not subordinate to anyone. Although the three families jostled for power, thanks to the diplomatic skill of the Stewart family and the examples set by former kings Robert the Bruce and John Balliol, Scotland stood firm amidst the storms. At this very moment, St. Andrew watches over Scotland."

This legislation required all landowners to report their holdings and boundaries to the government, accurately recording the size and value of each plot. Landowners failing to comply with these regulations faced fines or forfeiture of their land titles.\n\nFurthermore, the act stipulated that the government had the authority to confiscate any land proven to have been acquired illegally and return it to its rightful owner.

Against this backdrop, the Gaels became the pillar and safeguard of Scotland.\n\nThe Gaels were the primary inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands, living in rugged mountainous terrain. With their brave and resilient character, they had long been engaged in struggle against the English. In the wars against England, the Gaels formed the mainstay of Scotland's military forces. They excelled at utilizing the terrain and varying tactics to counter the English armies, and through their combat skills and courage, they successfully repelled English offensives. In the wars against England, the Gaels played a crucial role, becoming staunch supporters of the Scottish state.\n\nBeyond their battlefield contributions, the Gaels were involved in all aspects of Scottish political life.

EDG_flavorSCO.9.d:0 "Robert Burns, the Scottish Ploughman Poet, holds a uniquely important place in the literary history of Britain. He revived and enriched Scottish folk songs; his poetry is inherently musical and can be sung. Burns was born in an era when the Scottish nation faced conquest by foreign powers, thus his verse is filled with radical ideas of democracy and freedom. Living in a countryside of破产 farmers and sharing a deep connection with the impoverished peasantry, his poetry celebrates the beauty of his homeland and expresses the simple friendships and loves of working people. In 1786, Burns published his first work, 'Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect.' The success of this collection led him to abandon all plans of leaving Scotland. Instead, he went to Edinburgh and became a celebrity in social and literary circles. In Ireland and America, his works were pirated, making him an international figure. The collection demonstrates the poet's break from the Neoclassical style then dominant in British poetry, drawing nourishment from local life and folk literature, thereby infusing poetic creation with fresh vitality and forming the fundamental characteristics of his work. It celebrates nature and rural life with devout emotion and satirizes the hypocrisy of the church and people in daily life with piercingly sharp language."

He continuously preached and spread Christian faith and moral values, and dedicated himself to advancing the development of education, enabling more people to have the opportunity to receive schooling and learn about the Christian faith.\n\nUltimately, guided by his faith and principles, Sir John Hartley earned the respect and reverence of many. He became one of the most influential Christian leaders in 16th-century England and one of the most esteemed bishops in the history of Canterbury Cathedral."

EDG_flavorSCO.13.d:0 "Spenser was the most outstanding poet between Geoffrey Chaucer and Shakespeare. He was born in London into a cloth merchant's family and entered Cambridge University in 1569, where he studied literature, philosophy, and some natural sciences. Two years after graduating, he became a client in a noble household and simultaneously befriended poets of the British innovative poetry movement, represented by Sir Philip Sidney. Influenced by these poets' ideas, Spenser wrote and published his pastoral collection 'The Shepheardes Calender' in 1579. He also authored the long poem 'Prosopopoia, or Mother Hubberd's Tale,' the sonnet sequence 'Amoretti,' 'Epithalamion,' among others. In 1580, Spenser went to Ireland, residing in a castle granted to him by the Queen, where he wrote and published his masterpiece 'The Faerie Queene' between 1590 and 1596. In 1598, his home was burned down during the Irish rebellion, and he fled back to London. Spenser died in London the following year and was buried in the 'Poets' Corner' of Westminster Abbey, right next to Geoffrey Chaucer."

EDG_flavorSCO.18.d:0 "William Hogarth, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in Britain, was a famous British painter, printmaker, satirist, and a pioneer of European comic strips. His works cover an extremely wide range, from superb realist portraits to sequential print series. Many of his works frequently satirized and mocked the politics and customs of his time. This style later became known as the 'Hogarthian style,' and he is called the 'Father of British Painting.'\n\nAt the age of 23, Hogarth set up his own business as an engraver. He disliked the rigid rules of the academic school, preferred free rein, and excelled at satire. He learned oil painting from Sir James Thornhill, the King's Principal Painter. His artistic talent lay in a gift for imitation, a quality indispensable for his mastery of oil painting techniques. In his later years, Hogarth told young people about himself: 'I had a good eye. Besides, imitation is a natural tendency in children, but it was particularly strong in me. Imitating whatever I saw gave me unspeakable pleasure.'\n\nShortly after his series of engravings 'A Harlot's Progress' gained public attention, Hogarth fell in love with the daughter of an aristocrat. In that era, their love was forbidden due to their different social standings. They had no choice but to elope. Sir James Thornhill announced he was disowning his daughter, but Lady Thornhill, aching for her daughter, eventually relented. When Hogarth's aforementioned print series was exhibited, she bought it and displayed it in her dining room. The old Sir asked who had painted them, and his wife told him, 'Your son-in-law.' Seeing the young man's artistic talent, the old Sir tacitly accepted the fact."

EDG_flavorSCO.20.d:0 "The Howard family has a tradition of serving as Lord High Admiral. Howard's father, grandfather, and two of his uncles all held this position. Although Sir Francis Drake had more extensive naval experience than Howard, his lowly birth made him unsuitable for the role of Lord High Admiral. Thus, starting in 1585, Elizabeth I appointed Howard as Lord High Admiral.\n\nHoward demonstrated a very open-minded approach when commanding naval operations. He was able to heed the advice of those with rich experience in maritime warfare and collaborated effectively with Drake, John Hawkins, Martin Frobisher, and other experienced naval commanders. During the Battle of Gravelines in 1588, while Howard agreed with Drake's interception strategy—to stop the Spanish 'Invincible Armada' outside British waters—his naval command tactics became quite conservative once the Spanish fleet entered the English Channel. Howard preferred long-range maneuvers and harassment to exhaust the Spanish Armada, rather than actively engaging in close-quarters combat. After the immediate crisis passed, disease struck the British navy. During this time, Howard and his naval crews stood firmly together, jointly protesting the government's reluctance to provide them with treatment and its refusal to pay their wages."

EDG_flavorSCO.21.d:0 "Hawkins was born in 1532 into a family of merchant seamen in Plymouth, Devonshire, in southwestern England. The Hawkins family was a prominent maritime power along Britain's western coast at the time, with many members engaged in overseas commercial ventures. His father, William Hawkins, pioneered sea trade between Britain and Brazil starting in 1530, becoming a famous merchant and representing Plymouth in Parliament three times.\n\nHawkins received his nautical training from a young age on his family's ships. After his father's death in 1554, he inherited the business and began trading with Spain and the Canary Islands. Through these activities, he not only accumulated wealth but also learned that Spanish colonists in the West Indies were in dire need of slave labor. Consequently, Hawkins resolved to circumvent Spanish restrictions and engage in the highly profitable slave trade between Africa and the West Indies.\n\nIn 1572, Hawkins entered Parliament. In 1577, he succeeded his father-in-law as Treasurer of the Navy and later also served as Comptroller of the Navy. During his tenure in these key naval positions, he reformed naval finances, saving the Queen's government significant annual expenditure. Simultaneously, he directly oversaw the reconstruction of naval vessels. Had he been given more time, he would undoubtedly have completed this task excellently, bringing us longer-term benefits."

EDG_flavorSCO.23.d:0 "Drawing on the experience of navigators and adventurers like Drake and the needs of practical combat, Hawkins oversaw the construction of a new type of warship, of medium size and with a lower profile than previous models. These warships were fast, highly maneuverable, and capable of performing missions at sea even in severe weather. In naval tactics, Hawkins further promoted a new approach centered on artillery combat, moving away from the traditional tactic of closing with the enemy ship and boarding for close-quarters fighting. To enhance the firepower of warships, a lighter, more portable type of cannon gradually replaced the older models. These new cannons had less recoil, faster firing rates, and longer range. Additionally, Hawkins also built some fast auxiliary ships. By the time the Spanish Armada arrived in 1588, the British navy possessed 25 warships of over 100 tons burden and 18 fast auxiliary ships capable of ocean travel. In 1588, Britain and Spain fought the famous naval battle in the English Channel. The British ships, improved under Hawkins's direction, surpassed the Spanish vessels both in maneuverability and firepower, thereby providing favorable conditions for the British victory. Hawkins himself participated in the battle as a Rear Admiral and squadron commander. For his service in the battle, Hawkins was knighted."

For this event, Renaissance-style pavilions, courtiers, champions, and entertainers were all transported to France; the entourage for this summit numbered over 6,000 people. Henry VIII was 29 years old at the time, in the prime of his life, described by the Venetian ambassador as 'the handsomest king in Christendom.' By his command, he became the first British king to be addressed as 'Your Majesty,' instead of the previous 'Your Grace.'"

EDG_flavorSCO.25.d:0 "Thomas Wolsey was of humble origins; his father was a butcher and cattle dealer in Ipswich, Suffolk, who later purchased land and gradually became wealthy. Wolsey received his early education at Magdalen College, Oxford, obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree at the age of 15. In 1498, he served as Junior Bursar at Magdalen College and was promoted to Senior Bursar in 1499. During this period, Wolsey was also appointed as the priest of the parish of Limington, marking the beginning of his career in the Church. In 1503, he became the private chaplain to Sir Richard Nanfan. Nanfan, the British representative at the port of Calais, recommended Wolsey to King Henry VII. In 1507, Wolsey became Henry VII's private chaplain and assisted the king in diplomatic affairs. Thomas Wolsey expressed his desire to carry out a series of reforms and has petitioned our monarch accordingly."

EDG_flavorSCO.26.d:0 "In domestic affairs, due to the king's deep trust, Wolsey controlled the Great Seal, the Privy Seal, and the King's personal seal, thereby wielding power over the key departments of Britain. Firstly, in the judicial sphere, he developed the policies of Henry VII, emphasizing respect for the authority of the royal courts and the importance of adhering to the law. He advocated for the same judicial approach towards both the rich and the poor in the royal courts—a bold decision, as it was bound to infringe upon the interests of the nobility and provoke their opposition. In the early years of Henry VIII's reign, the activities of the royal courts had nearly ground to a halt. Wolsey revitalized them, using them to punish various riots and disturbances, particularly by subjecting lawless nobles to judicial proceedings. The royal court was originally an inner court department, composed of several of the king's privy councillors, serving the monarchy and handling cases directly related to the Crown. Wolsey opened it to the public, allowing ordinary cases involving lower-class individuals to be tried there as well. Simultaneously, Wolsey transferred cases involving forgery, perjury, and defamation from ecclesiastical courts to the royal courts, expanding their jurisdiction and effectively making the royal courts a crucial component of the national judicial system."

EDG_flavorSCO.27.d:0 "The Court of Chancery was a court of equity handling civil litigation, dealing with matters such as trusts, the execution of wills and contracts, and resolving disputes over property. The Court of Chancery had developed during the 14th and 15th centuries, adjudicating cases based on the provisions of common law. As societal conditions grew increasingly complex, common law's lack of flexibility and its lengthy trial procedures became inadequate for effectively resolving various cases related to commerce, contracts, and property. Wolsey modified the provisions of common law to adapt to changing circumstances, deciding cases based on the actual facts and the merits of the issues themselves. This allowed this judicial body to fully realize its efficacy and become a regular part of the national judiciary. Wolsey's reforms in the judicial system served to strengthen feudal autocratic rule."

EDG_flavorSCO.28.d:0 "Thomas Cromwell was an outstanding statesman during the transitional period of early modern Britain. The decade he assisted Henry VIII was a period of painful reform for Britain. Prior to this, although Britain possessed territorial and royal independence, it was subordinate to the Roman Catholic Church in religious matters. It was Cromwell who presided over and drafted the Act of Supremacy (1534) and a series of other statutes, which declared the King the supreme head of the Church in Britain, transforming Britain into a new type of monarchical state with independent sovereignty. Simultaneously, Cromwell promoted the legal publication of William Tyndale's translated Gaelic Bible in Britain, transferring the right to read the Bible from the clergy and upper classes, who understood Latin, to the common people, thereby facilitating the rooting of Protestantism in Britain. Furthermore, Cromwell presided over the dissolution of the monasteries, auctioning off monastic lands. On one hand, this replenished Henry VIII's treasury; on the other hand, large quantities of auctioned lands fell into the hands of the emerging bourgeois gentry, consolidating and strengthening their economic power and setting the stage for the future bourgeois revolution. His numerous and enduring administrative reforms 'provided a complete set of institutions for governing the new state he helped create. He once again fully demonstrated the demeanor of a constructive statesman, matched by few.'"

EDG_flavorSCO.29.d:0 "After Cromwell assumed key government positions, he implemented financial reforms. Prior to the reforms, Tudor royal revenues were primarily managed by three departments: the Treasury, the General Surveyors of the King's Prerogative, and the Duchy of Lancaster. This convoluted and chaotic system had long dominated royal financial administration. Following the start of the Reformation, revenues increased dramatically due to the confiscation of church lands. This sudden increase in income rendered the original financial mechanisms inadequate for the new circumstances. Consequently, Henry VIII tasked Thomas Cromwell, a reformist leader with extensive financial experience, with carrying out fiscal reforms. Cromwell utilized Parliament to pass a series of acts transferring church property and revenues into royal hands. Through parliamentary statutes, Cromwell established six parallel revenue courts and the Court of General Surveyors (responsible for revenues from lands acquired during the reigns of Henry VII and Wolsey), breaking the unified control of the inner chamber. The acts detailed the purpose, functions, personnel, and regulations of these revenue courts. Except for the Treasury, which retained its previous management style, the other financial courts were endowed with modernized financial management systems. They were headed by efficient Chancellors of the Exchequer who, under their authority, controlled cash, directly audited accounts, conducted budgeting, balanced revenues and expenditures, held the state seal, and operated with specified full-time personnel, powers, accounting and settlement procedures, along with a dedicated tax collection structure from central to local levels. The reformed financial departments became well-ordered, clearly divided permanent administrative bodies and were among the first to achieve independent development as government administrative agencies separated from the royal household administration. The financial institutional reforms promoted by Cromwell marked a crucial step for Britain towards a systematic and efficient modern state financial management system. Cromwell established a relatively stable taxation system. In 1534, he reorganized finances, securing from Parliament guarantees for Fifteenths and Tenths and Subsidies. That same year, he implemented the 'Act for the First Fruits and Tenths of the Clergy,' diverting the regular revenues that previously flowed to the Papacy to the state treasury. Additionally, a 1/10 income tax was levied on clerical benefices within Britain. These revenues, together with national customs duties, formed the foundation of the Tudor state's institutionalized taxation."

EDG_flavorSCO.30.d:0 "Thomas Cromwell forcibly confiscated the properties of approximately 400 smaller religious houses to replenish the royal treasury. This act of confiscation was not without precedent; Henry V had previously dissolved monasteries to fund the Agincourt campaign, and the King of Sweden had done the same in 1527. Many monasteries failed even to meet the minimum requirement of twelve monks. The thirteen Cistercian monasteries in Wales housed only 85 monks in total. In exchange for state pensions, many religious houses surrendered all their properties. Over an eight-year period, the 'privatization' of the monasteries brought the Crown nearly one million pounds in revenue. The face of England changed dramatically. The surviving monasteries became landmarks; Rievaulx Abbey, Fountains Abbey, and Wymondham Abbey stood tall in the countryside, much as urban churches were once ubiquitous. Most monasteries were stripped of their assets and then demolished, often using gunpowder, while their contents were lost through auctions. Many monastic sites became quarries, their stones used to expand private residences and build great hall chimneys. Monastic chapels were converted into parish churches, notably in Sherborne, Dorset, and Beverley, Yorkshire. Monastic lands were sold to anyone willing to pay, sparking a revolution that allowed the emerging merchant class to acquire land previously reserved for the nobility. Since the Black Death, England had undergone opportunistic social changes. No similar transfer of wealth had occurred since the Norman Conquest. The outcome significantly accelerated England's progress into the modern era."

EDG_flavorSCO.31.d:0 "The Pilgrim's Progress is a novel written by Britain's John Bunyan. The book is divided into two parts. In the First Part, the narrator dreams of a man named 'Christian' reading a book and learning that his city will be destroyed by heavenly fire, which fills him with terror. A figure named 'Evangelist' then instructs him that he must flee his hometown and journey to the Celestial City. Bearing the burden of the world, Christian embarks from that point on a difficult and courageous pilgrimage to seek salvation for himself and for others. The Second Part describes the pilgrimage of Christian's wife, 'Christiana,' and their children to the Celestial City, guided by a person named 'Great-heart.'\n\nThe purpose and process of these two journeys are fundamentally similar; both involve overcoming various hardships and dangers to ultimately achieve spiritual salvation. However, there are differences: the First Part focuses on Christian's individual spiritual journey as a seeker of truth facing the divine alone, while the Second Part emphasizes the communal life of Christians as a united body in love, collectively pursuing the heavenly goal. This community encompasses all types of Christians—men, women, children, and the elderly—with varying degrees of faith, courage, and strength. Yet, in all circumstances, they love and exhort one another, support and bear with each other, and grow together on the pilgrim's path. It resembles a family overflowing with love, devoid of competition or rivalry, characterized instead by harmony, order, consideration, forbearance, and inclusiveness."

EDG_flavorSCO.32.d:0 "In the mid-17th century, a Dutch professor steeped juniper berries in spirits to create a medicinal liquor for treating malaria among merchants and sailors. After subsequent refinements, the liquor's flavor profile became richer. The British poor loved it for its mellow aroma, and even more for its simple production and low cost. Seemingly overnight, gin establishments sprang up all over London. Handcarts selling gin filled the streets. Workers would often buy a cup after their shift, down it in one gulp, and then stagger away, disappearing around the next corner. Lack of money was no great obstacle either; one could buy a cloth soaked in gin, open wide, and wring it forcefully to squeeze out a few drops. Even previously respectable London women found its temptation hard to resist: they would spend entire nights indulging in taverns, chatting animatedly and flirting with all sorts, gulping down one glass after another, leaving childcare and housework completely forgotten."

King Henry VIII of England was also unwilling to adopt more radical Reformation measures and consequently instructed Parliament to pass this Act. The Act severely criticized Protestant doctrines such as allowing clerical marriage and denying the doctrine of Transubstantiation in the Eucharist, prescribing harsh punishments for supporters of these doctrines. Its aim was to curb criticism of Catholic doctrine and religious rituals, ensure the English people adhered to its main tenets, and prevent the Reformation from taking an extreme path. However, this Act also caused many issues, as numerous ministers believed it would push our religious reform onto an overly radical course."

Located in northwestern England, approximately 30 kilometers from Liverpool, it possessed abundant iron ore resources.\n\nBy the late 15th century, the Great Chester Iron Mine had become a major supplier for England, and its iron ore output continuously increased. This made Chester a prosperous city, attracting numerous merchants and artisans to settle there.\n\nThe miners of that era used traditional methods for extraction, heating and smelting the iron ore at high temperatures to produce iron bars and steel. Although the technology of the late 15th century was relatively rudimentary, the Great Chester Iron Mine remained one of the industrial centers of the time, making significant contributions to the contemporary economy and societal development."

It is said he was an ordinary man of humble origins, but on the battlefield, he displayed remarkable bravery and decisiveness.\n\nWilliam Blackburn demonstrated outstanding command ability and excellent judgment during the war against France. He often personally led raid operations, successfully destroying multiple French camps and fortresses. His soldiers firmly believed their general was their guardian spirit, as before every battle, William Blackburn would always boost morale and inspire them to charge forward.\n\nUltimately, under William Blackburn's leadership, the British army achieved victory in the war against France. This conflict made William Blackburn a legendary figure; his name was recorded in British history books, and he became one of the most distinguished war heroes of the campaign against France."

EDG_flavorSCO_land.8.d:0 "The Great Cornwall Copper Mine was one of the most famous copper mines in Britain during the 16th century. Reportedly, this mine was once regarded as a symbol of national wealth.\n\nLegend has it that the discovery of the Great Cornwall Copper Mine was an accidental event. At the time, a farmer, while ploughing his fields, found a peculiar stone in the ground and took it to the local church for the priest to examine. The priest believed the stone held some special significance and sent it to the most renowned scientist of the time for analysis. The results confirmed that the stone contained a large quantity of copper ore.\n\nAfter the news spread, many people flocked to the small village, attempting to extract more copper ore from the land. Soon after, the Great Cornwall Copper Mine became one of the most important copper mines in Europe.\n\nOver the following decades, the output of the Great Cornwall Copper Mine continuously increased, attracting more and more investors and merchants to operate there. These individuals not only brought immense wealth to the local economy but also drove advancements in technology and industry."

EDG_flavorSCO_land.9.d:0 "Devon textile machinery technology was one of the most advanced textile technologies in late 15th-century Europe, and its application in Britain was also widely promoted. In Britain, the Devon textile industry had gradually become one of the nation's important industries, but production efficiency remained relatively low and unable to meet growing demand. Therefore, the application of Devon textile machinery technology played an extremely important role for England's textile industry.\n\nThe introduction of Devon textile machinery technology significantly increased production efficiency in England's textile industry, while also improving product quality and quantity. The advantage of this technology lay in its ability to achieve continuous production, with a much faster production speed than traditional manual operations. These benefits led to the widespread application of Devon textile machinery technology in Britain, making it one of the mainstream technologies in England's textile industry at the time."

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.5.d:0 "The name Britannia derives from the goddess Britannia, whose origins may trace back to Brigid, the Celtic goddess of the oak, or Boudica, queen of the ancient Celtic Iceni tribe. Coins issued by the Roman Emperor Hadrian featured a personified image of Britannia. Early depictions portrayed Britannia as a beautiful young woman, wearing a Roman centurion's helmet, clad in a white Roman stola, with her right breast exposed. She was typically seated on a throne upon a rock, holding a spear and a shield. Sometimes she wielded a trident or sat upon a globe above the waves. Britannia represents our sacred lineage and long history, symbolizing the radiant birth of a new empire.

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.1.d:0 "Alexander IV was a capable young monarch who experienced a bloody struggle for power within the court early in his life, nearly suffocated to death with a pillow by his own mother, yet he ultimately survived and was crowned King of Scotland. As a prince with an unfortunate childhood, Alexander IV trusted no one; anyone could be used and discarded by him at any moment. However, he always managed to conceal his misdeeds, maintaining a positive personal image that allowed others to willingly submit to him, thereby enabling him to implement numerous reforms.\n\nBuilding upon the Scottish system of elective monarchy, Alexander IV established a completely new and dynamic system. He expanded the membership of the electoral parliament, introducing a large number of minor nobles, burghers, and clergy, thereby weakening the power of the great nobles and enhancing royal autocracy by expanding the authority of the privy council. Since Alexander established his capital in Lothian, this system became known as the Lothian System."

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.2.d:0 "The reign of King Edward II of England can hardly be described even as mediocre. The ever-expanding power of the nobility increasingly confined royal authority to the southeastern corner of England, effectively reducing the king to the Earl of London. The royal favorite, the Earl of Cornwall, was forced into exile twice under pressure from a faction of nobles led by the king's own cousin, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Defeat in the border wars in Northumbria and the Great Famine of 1315-1317 dealt heavy blows to this already beleaguered kingdom. After the king's final, inevitable failure to free himself from the control of these unruly nobles, many of the magnates of the Kingdom of England finally slipped from the king's grasp. Several boroughs in the East Midlands, having escaped the king's effective control, established autonomous municipal governments. Merchants within these boroughs enjoyed economic and political privileges: their economic rents could be reduced, and they possessed broad voting rights. If we preserve these borough privileges after conquering the region, the local economic order might be maintained."

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.3.d:0 "The Lollards were followers of Wycliffe in late medieval England. This derogatory term originated from Middle Dutch, meaning 'mumbler,' and was earlier used for European groups suspected of heresy. In 14th-century England, the Church was the largest feudal ruling class, owning approximately one-third of the land in England. It exploited English peasants not only through rents and labor services but also through heavy taxes and the shameless sale of fake saintly relics, draining the lifeblood of the faithful. The corruption, decadence, and brazen extortion of the Catholic Church not only deepened people's hatred for the clergy but also stimulated national consciousness, pushing the anti-clerical sentiment long present in English society into a new phase in the 14th century. The conflict between royal authority and the Papacy grew increasingly severe. Throughout the 14th century, Parliament passed a series of statutes opposing papal interference in English internal affairs. Simultaneously, the nobility found common cause with the lower-ranking knights and the emerging burghers; they were filled with envy and dissatisfaction towards the abbots living corrupt lives and wielding state power. Clearly, the old feudal theological worldview could no longer satisfy this new generation. The common people at the bottom, suffering under dual oppression from both Church and secular authorities, were the most likely to join such anti-clerical movements.\n\nIn the 14th century, the English theologian John Wycliffe launched a fierce assault against the Roman Catholic Church, heralding the beginning of the European Reformation. Furthermore, as the reforms deepened, Wycliffe's proposals for church reform gained strong support from knights, commoners, and the emerging bourgeoisie. According to the needs of their own social strata, they enthusiastically joined this religious reform movement, and these people were disparagingly called 'Lollards,' labeled as heretics. The first Lollards centered around Wycliffe's colleagues at Oxford University, led by Nicholas of Hereford. In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury forced some Oxford Lollards to recant their views, but the sect continued to expand. A Lollard uprising in 1414 was quickly defeated by the King of England; the rebellion was met with brutal reprisals. However, due to the general malaise and turmoil within the Catholic world, this uprising did not mark the end of the Lollards' public political influence. Increasing numbers of lower-class people and clerics began openly or secretly adopting Lollardy, gradually moving beyond the control of the English rulers.\n\nBy 1444, large numbers of believers in southern England had converted to Lollardy, and the region of East Anglia had established its own Lollard church, breaking away from the control of the Roman Papacy. The rulers of East Anglia also held Lollard doctrines as their guiding principle, establishing a Lollard Council subordinate to the Duke to manage the local Lollard faithful and provide support for the ruler."

Castles were built on each side of the River Ouse. Over time, York gradually developed into an important city and became the administrative center of Yorkshire. As the influence of the Kingdom of Scotland extended into the York region, it evolved into a military borderland between Scotland and England, with its strategic military importance growing steadily. After gaining control of York, our ministers have proposed the construction of stronger fortifications in this location."

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.9.d:0 "In $YEAR$, a movement known as Greater Celticism emerged in Scotland. The origins of this movement can be traced back to the frequent wars between Scotland and England in the late medieval period. During this time, the Scottish people began to rediscover their Celtic heritage, seeking to strengthen their identity and sense of unity through it. These efforts at cultural revival ultimately led to the outbreak of the 'Greater Celticism' movement.\n\nIn this movement, Celtic history, language, and culture were revered as sacred, seen as the wellspring of Scottish national creativity. Cultural elements such as traditional Celtic music, dance, and crafts became symbols of the movement.\n\nHowever, 'Greater Celticism' was not merely a cultural revival movement; it also held political and social significance. In Scottish society at the time, class struggle between the nobility and commoners was intense. Celtic culture was viewed as a shared identity transcending social classes and was thus widely employed in various political movements.\n\nFurthermore, 'Greater Celticism' attempted to assimilate other ethnic groups within Scotland into the Celtic culture and nation. This included other peoples living in Scotland at the time, such as the English, Northumbrians, and Dutch.\n\nIn summary, the 'Greater Celticism' movement was a significant cultural and political movement in Scottish history. It not only strengthened the Scottish people's identity and sense of unity but also promoted the preservation and development of Celtic culture."

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.10.d:0 "In $YEAR$, although Ireland had achieved a brief period of unification, in reality, division and conflict among its various clans had persisted for centuries. The Kingdom of [Root.GetAdjective] dispatched envoys to Ireland to make contact with the different clans and attempt to establish relations with them.

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.11.d:0 "In $YEAR$, [Root.GetAdjective]'s [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] issued a significant decree known as the Ayr Proclamation. The purpose of this decree was to expand the power of the minor nobility, burghers, and clergy while limiting the influence of the great nobles, thereby ensuring national stability and prosperity.\n\nPrior to this, the political situation in [Root.GetAdjective] was highly tense. The great nobles held absolute power and frequently used their positions to suppress the interests of other social classes. This led to social discontent and unrest, severely hindering the nation's development.\n\nTherefore, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to take action and issued the Ayr Proclamation. This decree explicitly stipulated that all individuals should have equal opportunities to hold positions in the government and judiciary. The minor nobility, burghers, and clergy gained greater political participation and a voice, and were granted certain powers.\n\nSimultaneously, the power of the great nobles was restricted. These magnates had to abide by the newly enacted laws and regulations and could no longer arbitrarily abuse their authority. They also had to acknowledge the legitimate rights of the minor nobility, burghers, and clergy, and could no longer monopolize political and economic resources.\n\nThe issuance of the Ayr Proclamation provoked a degree of controversy and opposition. Some great nobles believed the decree threatened their interests and status and therefore attempted to obstruct and oppose it. However, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] firmly implemented the decree and took effective measures to ensure its comprehensive enforcement.\n\nThe proclamation had a significant impact on Scottish society. It broke the monopoly of the great nobles and maintained social stability and balance.

EDG_flavorSCO_mission.14.d:0 "Historically, Britain never became as deeply entangled in the political whirlpools of the European continent and the Papacy as Germany did. Consequently, the Celtic peoples did not develop the same intense moral indignation and national resentment towards the corrupt Roman Church as the Germans. In the past, a spirit focused on reality and practicality meant the Celts were less inclined than the Germans to fervently pursue inner faith or spiritual experience. However, with the rise of the Celtic nations on the British Isles over the past century, numerous social factors still hindered a full Celtic revival. Greater Celticism gradually captured public attention, with people yearning to strengthen their nation's Celtic nationalist forces and build a more advanced nation-state.\n\nDuring this Celtic resurgence, the power of the domestic bourgeoisie also continuously grew. The bourgeoisie demanded to break free from the constraints of feudal theological thought and called for religious reform. As Renaissance and Reformation ideas spread, anti-clerical sentiment rose among all social classes. Meanwhile, the increasingly powerful monarchy sought to shake off the shackles of Roman ecclesiastical authority. Whether driven by nationalist sentiment or the needs of practical politics and state interests, a Reformation belonging to the Celtic peoples became inevitable.\n\nIn $YEAR$, a gathering assembled in the palace of [Root.GetAdjective]'s [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].

EDG_flavorSCO_colonial.3.d:0 "In $YEAR$, [Root.GetAdjective] settlers began expanding colonies into the southern part of North America, gradually establishing tobacco plantations and slave-based agricultural estates. This period traces back to 1629, when [Root.GetAdjective] merchants presented a colonial plan for North America to the [Root.GetAdjective] Crown.\n\nThe primary objective of the [Root.GetAdjective] settlers in the southern North American region was the cultivation of tobacco. They discovered that the climate of this area was highly suitable for tobacco growth, and market demand was substantial. Through trade with local Native Americans, the [Root.GetAdjective] settlers acquired land and commenced tobacco cultivation. Over the following decades, they continuously expanded their planting scale, becoming one of the most significant tobacco producers in North America at the time.\n\nHowever, tobacco cultivation required a large labor force, leading the [Root.GetAdjective] settlers to begin utilizing slave labor. Initially, they trafficked slaves from Africa, but due to high costs, they later started purchasing indentured servants from Europe. These workers typically signed contracts to work for their masters for a number of years in exchange for certain compensation.

EDG_flavorSCO_colonial.4.d:0 "In 1540, Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devonshire, Britain. Drake's father was a yeoman farmer from Tavistock, north of Plymouth. In 1549, Catholics in Cornwall initiated the "Prayer Book Rebellion" opposing Edward VI's decision to use the English Book of Common Prayer. The rebellion soon spread to Devonshire. Drake's father, a devout Protestant, relocated to Plymouth, where Protestant influence was strong, seeking refuge on a small island in the sound. This island is now named Drake's Island and serves as a camping ground for the Sea Cadet Corps.\n\nSoon after, Drake's father moved again, this time to Gillingham near the mouth of the Thames, serving as a temporary chaplain for the workers and sailors at the newly established Chatham Dockyard. From the age of ten, Drake served as an apprentice sailor under Captain Whiteland, sailing along the coasts of France and the Netherlands, learning the practical aspects of navigation. By seventeen, Drake had become the captain of a small coastal vessel.\n\nUpon hearing of the immense profits John Hawkins had gained from the triangular trade, Drake resolutely sold his own ship and joined Hawkins's third voyage. However, in September 1568, while Drake and his cousin Hawkins were leading five slave ships to Mexico, their vessels were severely damaged by a storm. Initially, the Spanish governor permitted them to enter the port of Veracruz for repairs. But as the British entry into the Caribbean had already encroached upon Spain's sphere of influence, the governor suddenly ordered an attack. All British crew members were executed; only Drake and Hawkins escaped with their lives. This event became known as the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa.\n\nBehind this incident lay the power disparity between England and Spain, exacerbated by religious conflicts, forcing both sides into irregular maritime confrontations. Among the various methods of contention, privateering became a significant one. This engagement rapidly deteriorated Anglo-Spanish relations. The following year, England seized several Spanish treasure ships dispatched to support armies in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their privateering activities to break Spain's monopoly on Atlantic trade.\n\nFrom his youth, Drake had deeply experienced persecution from Catholics, harboring a bitter hatred and a strong spirit of resistance against Catholicism. The loss of his investment at San Juan de Ulúa in an instant further ignited his fury towards Spain.\n\nAfter his initial foray to the West Indies in 1569-1570, Drake received a letter of marque from the Queen in 1571. His cousin, John Hawkins, due to his military exploits, became Treasurer of the Navy and the official in charge of the Royal Dockyard at Deptford, responsible for researching and upgrading warship performance. This role greatly assisted Drake's subsequent voyages and even the campaign to defeat the Spanish Armada. After receiving the Queen's license for reprisal, Drake began leading his own fleet in relentless raids and plunder against Spanish colonies in the West Indies and Central and South America."

They typically acquired necessary supplies through trade with local indigenous peoples while gradually beginning to establish their own plantations. These plantations primarily cultivated cash crops like sugarcane, tobacco, and coffee.\n\nOver time, the economic position of the [Root.GetAdjective] people in the Caribbean continuously strengthened. They actively participated in international trade and quickly became one of the main players in the sugar and tobacco trade. However, due to a lack of sufficient capital and resources, the Scots were unable to expand their sphere of influence like other major European powers.

This diamond, mounted on the [Root.GetAdjective] Crown, is believed to be cursed. An Indian proverb once warned: 'He who owns this diamond will own the world, but will also know all its misfortunes. Only God or a woman can wear it with impunity.'\n\nThe diamond has caused disputes between the Indian government and the British Crown. Its history dates back to the 14th century, and since then, murders and betrayals have followed this diamond closely. In the 18th century, the Persian emperor Nader Shah attacked the Mughal Empire, and what he desired was this very diamond. When his search proved fruitless, a harem concubine hinted to him that the diamond was hidden in the turban of the Mughal Sultan. When the Persian emperor examined the Sultan's turban and found the diamond within, its size and brilliance astonished him, causing him to exclaim 'Koh-i-Noor!' (Mountain of Light). Thus, the diamond received its name."
