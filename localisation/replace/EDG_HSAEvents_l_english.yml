EDG_HSAEvents.0.desc:0 "As the Imperial Grand Marshal, Saxony lies to the south of the Hanseatic League. If we do not wish for conflict with them, a friendly treaty could perhaps alter our relations.\n\nWe shall present them with a contract, forming a stable alliance. The Hanseatic League will provide funds to assist the Grand Marshal in handling various matters within the Empire, and the Grand Marshal will in turn assume the responsibility of defending the Hanseatic League.\n\nIf the treaty is established, we will secure the Salt Route, enabling better execution of our subsequent trade activities."

EDG_HSAEvents.1.desc:0 "The leader of the Hanseatic League, Lübeck, located to our north and bordering us, has recently submitted an application to us, hoping we can reach an agreement.\n\nThis agreement stipulates that the Hanseatic League will provide funds to support our handling of internal imperial affairs, while we in turn guarantee not to militarily interfere with the Hanseatic League's trade activities and assume the duty of protecting the Hanseatic League.\n\nIf the agreement is passed, we will gain considerable funds and economic support from the Hanseatic League. Alternatively, we can choose to refuse this agreement. After all, only Lübeck under our control can create the greatest benefit for us, is that not so?"
EDG_HSAEvents.1.aa:0 "We agree to this agreement"

EDG_HSAEvents.4.desc:0 "Centuries ago, brave Icelandic sailors discovered a large island in the far north—Greenland—and established settlements there. As Iceland became part of the Norwegian Crown, Greenland also became a Norwegian colony, and a trade route from Norway to Greenland was established.\nAlthough contact between Norway and Greenland has been lost for some time, those Norwegians must still possess the sea charts to Greenland. With just a small incentive from us, these charts can be ours."
EDG_HSAEvents.4.aa:0 "They might still be useful."
EDG_HSAEvents.5.name:0 "The Queen of the Baltic"
EDG_HSAEvents.5.desc:0 "The old Lübeck castle first appeared as early as 819 AD. In the 11th century, it was renamed Liubice, meaning 'lovely city'. In 1143 AD, Count Adolf II of Holstein rebuilt the city of Lübeck on the foundations of Liubice, forming the prototype of the present inner city. After the great fire of 1159, Lübeck was replanned with a street layout resembling fish bones, well-connected in all directions. This model later became sought after in urban construction across Northwestern Europe, with cities like Stockholm following suit.\n\nIn 1266, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II declared Lübeck a 'Free City', directly subordinate to the 'central' authority administratively, while economically functioning like a 'special zone' or free trade port. In 1356, with rapid economic and trade growth, Lübeck became the headquarters of the Hanseatic League, solidifying its important position in European economics and politics at the time.\n\nThe Hanseatic League was then a commercial organization founded by cities in northern Germany such as Hamburg, Bremen, and Rostock to safeguard mutual interests in trade activities. From 1370-1402, due to rampant piracy and banditry, primarily by the Victual Brothers, many towns actively joined the Hanseatic League seeking protection, and the cities began to collectively organize armed forces to combat the bandits. By the late 14th century, its membership exceeded 160 cities. It began developing maritime ventures, expanding trade with Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, North Africa, and Central Asia, and establishing trading posts in France, Iberia, Novgorod, and elsewhere, forming an intercontinental trade network of the era. In 1375, the then Holy Roman Emperor bestowed upon Lübeck the title 'Holy City', placing it alongside the four cities of Rome, Venice, Pisa, and Florence.\n\nNow the Hanseatic League is entering its ascendant period, and Lübeck, as the leading city, bears the responsibility of guiding the entire Hanseatic League's continued development. In the past, Lübeck was granted the title and corresponding privileges of a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire, and this shall become the capital of its rise—the land of the Golden Boar aims to lead the entire German region to prosperity and flourishing by establishing a trade empire."
