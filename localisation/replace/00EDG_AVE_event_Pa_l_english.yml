EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.1.d:0 "For centuries, traditional knights across Europe have showcased and honed their combat skills in tournaments. Recent technological advancements, such as the introduction of tilt barriers to prevent collisions and more protective armor, have refined these events. This has led to tournaments increasingly resembling entertainment spectacles rather than practical combat drills, yet it also means more people can participate than ever before.\n\nTraditionally, the origins of these chivalric tournaments can be traced to the Burgundy region. In the year 800 AD, Charlemagne of the Frankish Kingdom unified Western Europe and was crowned 'Emperor of the Romans' by the Pope. The twelve valiant warriors who fought alongside Charlemagne in his southern and northern campaigns were naturally regarded as the 'Guardians of God,' known as 'Paladins' or Holy Knights, which is seen as the origin of knighthood. Since then, frequent jousting tournaments have been held in the region, further developing its martial traditions.\n\nOur nation's banners flutter high in the wind, and gilded trumpets sound a four-note fanfare to honor our equestrian elite. The air is filled with the aroma of roasted almonds, the scent of horses, and an atmosphere of vibrant excitement. Our cultural and military excellence greatly benefits the nation's development, a fact now more evident than ever.\n\nWith our control over the Land of Chivalry, proposals have been made to further promote and deepen the influence of traditional Western European chivalric spirit and virtues, embedding them deeply into our homeland, people, royalty, and court.\n\nEvery decade, we will be able to select a chivalric virtue to imprint into our Plantagenet Royal Authority."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.2.t:0 "The Governance of Naples"
EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.2.d:0 "In the early 12th century, the Normans had unified the regions of southern Italy and Sicily, formerly held by the Byzantines, Lombards, and Muslims, into a single state. In 1130, they adopted the title of King of Sicily and Apulia, though this was not recognized by the Pope or the Holy Roman Emperor. By the late 12th century, the kingdom had passed to the Hohenstaufen emperors, experiencing a period of great prosperity in politics, economy, and culture. After the legitimate Hohenstaufen line ended, Charles of Anjou, brother of King Louis IX of France, was invited by the Pope to take control of the kingdom (1266). Charles moved the capital from Palermo in Sicily to Naples, reflecting his northern-oriented policy. He became the leader of the Guelph (Papal) faction in northern Italy. However, his tyrannical rule and heavy taxes sparked the revolt known as the Sicilian Vespers (1282), which resulted in Sicily separating politically from the mainland, with the Aragonese crown of Spain taking the island's throne. This event had a significant impact on the history of both Naples and Sicily.\n\nFollowing the fragmentation of the Aragonese Kingdom, Naples and Sicily once again found themselves in a precarious state, with various other claimants eager to seize this prized territory. The two main contenders for the Sicilian throne—Tancred of Lecce, the illegitimate son of Roger III, and Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor—fought to a stalemate. After lengthy negotiations and under papal supervision, they were forced to sign the unsatisfactory Treaty of Amalfi. The treaty stipulated that the Kingdom of Sicily be divided: the House of Hauteville would retain their holdings on the Italian peninsula, known as the "Peninsular Sicily" throne, while the House of Hohenstaufen would occupy the island of Sicily, referred to as "Trinacria," derived from Sicily's three-legged symbol.\n\nHowever, the sovereignty of both sides proved short-lived. On the peninsula, the significantly weakened Hauteville house faced challenges from other noble Sicilian families, who claimed that Tancred of Lecce, as an illegitimate son, had no right to Roger III's inheritance and that the legitimate Hauteville line had ended. Tancred himself crushed four or five such rebellions, but upon his death and the succession of his son, William III, the undeterred Hohenstaufen dynasty once again incited internal strife in Peninsular Sicily, attempting to fragment it to pave the way for future invasion. This time, the Hautevilles did not achieve final victory; the throne of Peninsular Sicily was overthrown. In 1260, the aging William III was only allowed to retain the titles of Duke of Apulia and Lecce, marking the dissolution of the Norman dynasty in southern Italy.\n\nSubsequently, the region of Naples descended into prolonged turmoil. Now, as descendants of another branch of the Normans, we have once again unified these Norman lands. It is time to decide how to govern them."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.3.t:0 "The Ownership of the Italian Crown"
EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.3.d:0 "The region of Italy has a long history, and its relationship with our nation is equally deep-rooted. This is the birthplace of the ancient Roman Empire. In 510 BC, the Romans ended the Roman Kingdom era and established a Republic, with power divided among the Senate, Consuls, and Tribal Assembly. The Roman Republic extended to southern Italy, and after the Second Punic War in 241 BC, Sicily was incorporated into its territory. By 202 BC, through four Macedonian Wars and the Third Punic War, Rome had defeated Carthage and brought Spain and Greece under its control. Later, via the Syrian Wars, Rome gained control over parts of West Asia.\n\nOur connection with them perhaps traces back to the time of Caesar. In 49 BC, Julius Caesar led his troops across the Rubicon River. According to Roman law, only consuls and praetors were permitted to command armies in Italy south of the Rubicon; anyone else leading an army across was considered an act of rebellion. Thus, crossing the river was not merely entering Italy but a declaration of war. This marked the first invasion of the Italian peninsula by a political faction centered in the heartland of France.\n\nIn 410 AD, the Germanic Goths, led by Alaric, entered Italy and besieged Rome. With the help of slaves inside the city, the gates were opened, and the city was sacked. Subsequently, the Visigothic and Ostrogothic Kingdoms were established within the Western Roman Empire. For a considerable period thereafter, England, France, and Italy could essentially be considered as sharing common roots. The historical relationship between Italy and France dates back to shared cultural and linguistic origins, both stemming from the ancient Frankish Kingdom. Although England's origins differ from Italy and France, being established by the Anglo-Saxons, the House of Plantagenet originated from the French House of Anjou, maintaining close ties with the former.\n\nFrom 962 AD to the 11th century, northern and central Italy became part of the 'Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation,' while the south remained Byzantine territory until the 11th century when the Normans invaded southern Italy and established the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. With the collapse of Holy Roman Empire rule in Italy, the region fragmented into numerous kingdoms, duchies, city-states, and small feudal holdings.\n\nIn the turbulent history to come, the struggle between France and Spain over the Apennine Peninsula intensified, leading to decades of Italian Wars, with most of Italy's territory being occupied by France, Spain, and Austria in succession. However, now, these future possibilities may never come to pass. With our control over the entire Italian peninsula, it is time to decide the fate of Italy's ancient crown."

Its first King of England was Henry II. Besides their ancestral hereditary lands, the County of Anjou, this dynasty once ruled the Duchy of Normandy, the Kingdom of England, and the Duchy of Aquitaine. They briefly held a vast domain stretching from the Pyrenees to the Scottish border, and the Kingdom of England during this period is historically referred to as the 'Angevin Empire.'\n\n'Plantagenet' was the nickname of Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou, father of Henry II.

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.7.d:0 "The Quadruple Alliance, formed by the kingdoms of England, Lotharingia, Arles, and Aragon, aimed to counter and limit the expansion of the Capetian dynasty. When Pope Innocent III launched a crusade against the Almohad Caliphate in Iberia, King Peter II of Aragon feigned compliance with French and Papal commands while secretly making peace with the Almohad Sultan. He leaked the crusaders' routes, leading to the ambush of French knights and Castilian troops by Muslims, causing the campaign to fail and indirectly protecting his sphere of influence in southern France. However, Aragon's alliance with Arles also led to a large number of Cathars from Languedoc moving south, continuously expanding Cathar communities in Catalonia. This completely shattered Aragon's already fragile religious balance, and the kingdom's attitude gradually shifted from tolerance to severity. In 1261, "the Conqueror" James I made plans with the Ilkhanate to attack Egypt jointly. To raise military funds, his tax collectors knocked on every door in Barcelona demanding donations, which undoubtedly ignited the anger of Aragon's peasants. After setting out on his expedition, James I was attacked by Moorish pirates supported by the Abbasids; his fleet was destroyed, he was captured, and ultimately died from Moorish flogging. When news of the king's death reached Barcelona, long-suffering Cathar believers stormed the palace and seized control of Catalonia. This disastrous eastern campaign destroyed the Kingdom of Aragon. The southern Moorish governor took the opportunity to capture Valencia, while the Mozarabic populace in the west elected a priest to lead the kingdom, leaving the Aragonese claimants with only the small fragment of Teruel.\n\nNow, the influence of the Plantagenet dynasty blankets this war-torn land.

The young Eric lacked his mother's competence, and the Kalmar Union declined rapidly under his rule. After the Danish nobility opposed Eric's designated successor, his uncompromising stance ultimately sparked a civil war. Swedish Regent Karl VIII thus gained complete control over Swedish governance, effectively freeing Sweden and Norway from the Kalmar Union. Following his victory over the nobles, Eric sought to consolidate his rule domestically, implementing many policies to weaken the power of the burghers. This eventually led to a burgher uprising in 1439, where the burghers defeated Eric and forced him to grant greater autonomy to various municipalities. This rendered the Kingdom of Denmark virtually defunct, with the cities forming a commercial confederation on their own. Now, we can follow the tradition of the Kalmar Union to reintegrate the northern kingdoms and bestow upon them a suitable royal title. Alternatively, we could manage the unruly Nordic peoples separately to avoid any threat to our rule."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.14.d:0 "The 'Roman' in the Holy Roman Empire does not signify an inheritance of the ancient Roman Empire but is a theological concept. During the coronation in the year 800, Pope Leo bestowed the title of Roman Emperor upon the Frankish Charlemagne, transferring this divinely ordained Christian theological realm from the Romans to the Franks. Over the following centuries, Catholic ecclesiastical authority became the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire's legitimacy. Clergy, in the name of faith, extracted wealth from the Germans, wielding power both within institutions and over the countryside.\n\nHowever, the Roman Catholic Church forgot that its position was not truly granted by God but relied on the trust of the people. The church's relentless exploitation of peasants, artisans, and merchants eroded their piety. Rampant corruption in daily operations and imperious threats to secular authority made it increasingly intolerable for many German princes. Outdated dogma also failed to meet the faith demands of emerging nation-states. Yet the Emperor turned a deaf ear to the princes' discontent, intent on maintaining the existing hierarchy and order within the Empire, oblivious to the wildfire spread of heresies and religious divisions pushing the Empire toward the abyss.\n\nSince we have already declared a break with the Roman Catholic Church, we might as well harness the current German anger towards Catholicism, forcing the Holy Roman Emperor to confront the Reformation and steer the Empire's religious faith toward the middle ground of Anglicanism. We could also seize this opportunity to lay claim to the imperial throne, with the cost being merely the ire of a weak emperor."

EDG_flavorAVE_mission_Pa.15.d:0 "A stormy night.\n\nIn the inner chambers of the imperial palace, [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] wearily leans back in an armchair, eyes closed in contemplation. Thoughts of recent rumors of unrest within the Empire and the conspiracies of northern princes plotting in secret fill [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]'s mind.\n\n[Emperor.Monarch.GetName] cannot understand why the heretics, once easily crushed by force, are no longer vulnerable, or why merchants, once swayed by profit, now stand so united. And there are the newly risen Franks in the west, deluding subjects with dangerous doctrines, manipulating nobles with deft diplomacy, and forging an aggressive army like a greedy wolf in tailored clothing, drooling with ambition. Could it be that the political order built by [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]'s forebears is about to collapse in [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]'s own hands?\n\nOutside the window, rain drips from the eaves, rhythmically drumming a muffled beat on the tiles, like war drums before battle. [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] is agitated and distracted. [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] rises, draws the long-unused ceremonial sword, and swings it futilely in the air. The breeze stirred by the blade only affects the oil lamp on the table, causing its flickering flame to waver like the fate of the Empire.\n\n"Your Majesty!" A panicked shout interrupts [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]'s thoughts, footsteps approaching in a chaotic rhythm. Before [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] can express anger, the source of the voice appears. A flash of lightning illuminates a face contorted with fear—it is the diplomatic advisor. As if dragged from water, his face is a blur of indistinguishable rain and tears, eyes wide with horror, his once-splendid garments thoroughly soaked and clinging limply to his trembling form, all dignity lost.\n\n"Your Majesty," the advisor gasps, his rapid breaths like echoes from hell, "an ultimatum has arrived from Paris. They demand you lead the Empire to convert, or else..." "Or else what?" [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] feels as if standing in the rainy night outside, chilled from head to toe. The advisor's hollow words seem to come from another world: "Or else, they will march to demand retribution and force you to surrender the imperial throne..."\n\nIn an instant, thunder crashes outside the palace. The sword slips from [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]'s weakened fingers. [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] staggers back, collapsing into the armchair. A fierce gust of wind violently thrusts open the tightly shut window, extinguishing the last remaining light in the room. In the darkness, [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] reaches out feebly like a drowning person, grasping at nothing.\n\nAfter a long while, [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] struggles to part [Emperor.Monarch.GetHisHer] lips and forces out a reply,"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] awaits a reply, one that will decide the future of the continent.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] closes [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] eyes in contemplation, recalling the night of declaring the break with the Roman Curia. Perhaps it was merely an impulsive act driven by fervor, yet it won the support of most within the realm. Was it mere chance? [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not know, but now many Germans share [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] sentiments. The opportunity to completely settle accounts with the Catholic Church within the Holy Roman Empire is at hand. And blocking the path of the Plantagenet army is only that emperor in name. At this thought, the cold contours of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s face curve into a hint of scorn.\n\nTorrential rain pours down; bean-sized droplets recklessly drum against the armor like war drums before battle. Never has [Root.Monarch.GetName] felt so clear-headed. Slowly drawing the sword, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes at its mirror-like blade. Behind [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] resolute eyes, war banners flutter vigorously as if dancing in the wind.\n\nFrom the distance comes the distinct clatter of hooves. A messenger cuts through the rain like lightning. Dismounting swiftly, the messenger strides to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s front. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has received the reply. In an instant, [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] eyes widen with fury, heart pounding fiercely. [Root.Monarch.GetName] never imagined that weak emperor would dare defy [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] will. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] feels greater joy—it has been too long since anyone dared face [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] mighty army. A flash of lightning illuminates the elite troops poised for action before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] gaze transcends their burning battle fervor, as if peering toward the heart of the Holy Roman Empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] understands this is a war to shatter the old order; no one can stand aside.\n\nWhen was the last time [Root.Monarch.GetName] swung a sword? [Root.Monarch.GetName] tightens [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] grip on the sword, momentarily lost in thought—was it against Scotland's ambitious Alexander, or France's diplomatic Capetians?

They scrutinize the newcomer curiously, unable to stop their hushed whispers. Is he our new protector? Will he tear down our churches? Those who know the history of the House of Plantagenet clench their fists in secret, but the sight of the army's fluttering banners leaves them despondent. They know all resistance is futile, for none can withstand the might of Anglicanism.\n\nThere are also welcoming lines eagerly awaiting; allied soldiers excitedly wave their fists, and converts to Anglicanism pray devoutly. They celebrate, having finally reached this day of victory. A resolute and decisive ruler replaces the weak and incompetent emperor; God's plenipotentiary on earth arrives at the heart of the empire. Perhaps other costs will come in the future, but at least for now, there is no need to fear decline.\n\nInside the court, banners and emblems of the House of Plantagenet are hung everywhere; flowers and music together adorn the immortal victory. Nobles in splendid attire bow their heads one after another, while uneasy clergy await their fate. At the end of the crowd of courtiers, the officiant waits before the throne for the new sovereign. [Root.Monarch.GetName] steps forward slowly, examining the bishop who stands with lowered eyes and bowed head. The bishop's aged hands tremble slightly, hesitating whether to follow the traditional formalities. [Root.Monarch.GetName] disregards his expectations, reaches out, picks up the imperial crown symbolizing the empire's power, and places it upon [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] own head. Amidst the admiration of the loyal and the terror of the doubtful, the Roman pseudo-church that usurped God's glory completely loses its right to dominate Germany. The glory of the House of Plantagenet brings a new legacy to the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nExiting the palace doors, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is greeted by brilliant sunlight. The conqueror silently mounts [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] horse; attendants raise banners high around [Root.Monarch.GetHimHer], escorting the emperor home in triumph. Have the infidels in the south returned? Will the northern conquerors submit with courtesy? Having clarified the goals of the House of Plantagenet, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sets a direction in [Root.Monarch.GetHisHer] heart, and the army's awe-inspiring might fills [Root.Monarch.GetHimHer] with soaring pride.

Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] led the army eastward, straight for the empire's heart. Along the way, the Anglican coalition fought victory after victory, crushing one Catholic prince after another. Yet today, they face unprecedented resistance.\n\nLooking at the city that has long withstood assault, [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot help but fall into self-doubt. The path here has been littered with devastation and suffering; the Catholic alliance is far more tenacious than imagined. It seems the power of faith not only shields Anglican soldiers but also blesses Catholic blades. The war of attrition steadily drains the coalition's supplies and morale. How much more must Frangleterre pay for this victory?\n\nSuddenly, a commotion arises outside the camp, as if thousands are shouting simultaneously, yet the sound's origin and direction are indistinguishable. It is a cacophony of hysterical fear and joy.
