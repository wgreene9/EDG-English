EDG_TUR_mission_1_1_desc:0 "Forty years ago, the brutal Timur led his great army to invade Asia Minor. Sultan 'The Thunderbolt' Bayezid led his troops to meet them, and the two sides fought a decisive battle at Ankara in 1402. Bayezid was defeated and captured, later dying in prison. His sons engaged in a bloody civil war, and to this day, the Ottoman Sultanate has not been reunified. This division cannot continue. We will make the glory of the Turks shine once more upon the lands of the East."
EDG_TUR_mission_1_2_desc:0 "After 'The Thunderbolt' Bayezid's defeat at Ankara, the Ottoman Empire was torn asunder. Our powerful enemies stabbed us in the back again and again. But this history of humiliation is about to end, for the great Ottoman Empire is once again united!"
EDG_TUR_mission_1_9_desc:0 "Pannonia lies at the heart of Europe. It was conquered by the Romans around 35-14 BC and made into a province. In the later Roman period, the Huns from Siberia in Asia swept across Europe after conquering the Germanic peoples and used Pannonia as a base to confront the Roman Empire, triggering the famous Great Migration in world history. After the Roman legions withdrew in 395, the Province of Pannonia ceased to exist. Later, the Avars, closely related to the Huns, entered the region. In 896, it served as a base for the Hungarians under Grand Prince Árpád to raid Europe. The Great Hungarian Plain (Pannonian Plain) in Central Europe takes its name from the Roman province of Pannonia. As the successors to the Roman Empire, we naturally have reason to reclaim this province and install our Pasha."
EDG_TUR_mission_1_10_desc:0 "Austria has always been our arch-nemesis. Long ago, when Sigismund was Holy Roman Emperor, Albert II was already slain by the Ottomans. This is by no means the end of our hatred."

EDG_TUR_mission_1_13_desc:0 "The wars between the Fatimid Caliphate, the Marinids, and the Almohads have brought poverty and chaos to North Africa. This land, now little more than ashes, lies adjacent to vital trade routes and desperately needs economic recovery."
EDG_TUR_mission_1_17_desc:0 "Córdoba was the glorious capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, holding immense religious significance. We shall build a magnificent city and grand mosques here."
EDG_TUR_mission_1_18_desc:0 "The Balkan Peninsula has a long history, being one of the earlier cradles of human civilization. Its southern region was the birthplace of ancient Greek culture. After the 2nd century BC, it was successively ruled by the Roman, Byzantine, and other empires. From the 4th to the 7th centuries AD, fierce struggles for dominance over the peninsula unfolded among the Huns, Avars, Lombards, Bulgars, Romans, and various Slavic peoples. Now, this land is fully under our control, and the new empire brings comprehensive prosperity."
EDG_TUR_mission_1_19_desc:0 "Kosovo has a long history. According to research by Croatian historian Alexander Stipcevic, the earliest inhabitants of Kosovo were more than 40 warlike nomadic tribes of the Illyrian Thracians, ancestors of the Albanians, who settled in Kosovo as early as the 4th-5th centuries BC. From the late 6th to early 7th centuries AD, large numbers of Slavic migrants crossed the Danube and settled in the Balkans. They built castles and churches, cultivated wastelands, and drove the pastoral Illyrians into the hills and mountains. In the 9th century, the Serbs, a South Slavic people, established their own state and discovered valuable riches here. Kosovo is not only rich in mineral resources but also a crucial strategic stronghold; he who rules Kosovo rules the Balkans."
EDG_TUR_mission_2_8_desc:0 "The Sanjak of World Peace is our autonomous territory for non-believers. Granting a degree of autonomy to non-Muslim rulers is a characteristic of our vassalage system."

EDG_TUR_mission_4_8_desc:0 "This inland sea between Southeastern Europe and the Anatolian peninsula of Asia is named for its dark waters and frequent storms.

EDG_TUR_mission_4_12_desc:0 "The ethnic origins of the Arabs can be traced back to ancient Semitic tribes, and they consider themselves descendants of Ishmael. Historically, they are related to the Assyrians, Arameans, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Hebrews, and others. In the early 7th century, after the rise of Islam, the various Arab tribes, united under the banner of Islam, rapidly expanded outward. By the mid-8th century, they had established the Arab Empire stretching from the Indus River in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, spanning Asia, Africa, and Europe. From the 10th century onward, the Arab state gradually declined and fragmented into many independent caliphates. In 1055, the Seljuk Turks captured Baghdad, ending the Eastern Caliphate. The western caliphates subsequently fell one after another, though the title of Caliph nominally persisted until 1258. Throughout these fluctuations, the Arab world remained in a state of division. Now, all Arab clans are subject to our rule."
EDG_TUR_mission_4_13_desc:0 "The Bedouins are a valiant and warlike people, highly skilled in martial arts and producing many excellent riders. Incorporating them into our military system will strengthen our cavalry forces."
EDG_TUR_mission_4_14_desc:0 "In Greek, 'Sicily' means 'three heads.' Located southwest of the Apennine Peninsula, it is the stumbling block on Italy's boot stretching into the Mediterranean. It is the largest island in the Mediterranean. Vast and fertile, with a warm climate and beautiful scenery, it abounds in citrus, lemons, and olives. Due to its excellent natural environment for agriculture and forestry, it has historically been called the 'Golden Basin.' After a Byzantine general took advantage of internal strife among the local Normans to conquer Sicily and establish a protectorate council, the island fell under Orthodox Christian rule. But soon, we shall conquer this 'Golden Basin.'"
EDG_TUR_mission_4_15_desc:0 "We have conquered all of Italy, we rule all of Italy, we are the Padishah of all Italy."
EDG_TUR_mission_4_16_desc:0 "The Rum Millet System is a politico-economic framework we established for managing the administrative and economic affairs of Italy. It grants a degree of autonomy to local cities, allowing citizens to participate in local governance, thereby reducing our administrative burden and increasing civic engagement."
EDG_TUR_mission_4_17_desc:0 "The Franks have harbored enmity towards Muslim nations since the Middle Ages, launching numerous Crusades against us. Now, we shall annihilate them."
EDG_TUR_mission_4_18_desc:0 "Historically, the French have often assimilated other peoples. Now, we will make them into Muslims assimilated by us."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_8_desc:0 "The Beys are the core force of our empire's local governance. Perfecting control and management over the Beys, ensuring a loyal and efficient Beylik system, will grant our government greater potential."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_9_desc:0 "The Qadis manage public order in the state and hold judicial power locally. Expanding the authority of the Qadis will serve as a check on the administrative and military power of the Beys."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_10_desc:0 "The Mamluks have long held power in Egypt, akin to a vast autonomous territory. However, their governance of Egypt is inefficient and chaotic. They do not deserve to wield such significant authority."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_11_desc:0 "The Nile River is Egypt's river of wealth. Proper management of this river will promote economic development in the Egyptian region, providing us with more industrial raw materials."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_12_desc:0 "Egypt was the granary of the empire during Roman times, an important agricultural colony. Although Egypt's economy suffered damage during the Mamluk period, we shall now restore Egypt's prosperity."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_14_desc:0 "The cunning Venetians have long been a thorn in our side. Previously, we lacked sufficient opportunity to punish them. Now, we shall hang the Doge of Venice."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_15_desc:0 "We have achieved a high degree of control over Venice. The local Venetian Pasha, to commemorate the empire's conquest of the Venetian region, renovated the former Doge's Palace, which now serves as the Pasha's administrative seat."
EDG_TUR_mission_5_16_desc:0 "The Latins may often appear cowardly, but under our empire's military-political system, we will absorb their advanced military technology, thereby strengthening our own military prowess."

The earliest East Slavic chronicle, 'The Primary Chronicle' (compiled in the 12th century), records the origin of 'the city of Kiev': the three brothers of the Polyan tribe—Ky, Shchek, and Khoryv—together 'built a town and named it Kiev after their eldest brother.' This occurred around the turn of the 6th to 7th centuries and formed the nucleus of the future city of Kiev. Kiev has endured prolonged devastation, but she shall stand tall in the future."

However, the Golden Horde had been ravaged by bloody internal strife, weakening its control over the western Kievan Rus' region. Prince Ivan I of Kiev, from the Rurikid dynasty, served as the Golden Horde's agent in Kievan Rus', but Ivan I harbored his own ambitions. By the late 14th century, as the Golden Horde gradually declined, Ivan I consolidated his position in Kievan Rus', successfully repelled attacks from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and even seized the principalities of Turov and Minsk from the Lithuanians. Ivan I died of illness in Kiev in 1440 at the age of 83. His son, Andrei I, proved incompetent and despotic. Disregarding the feudal rights of other princes at his father's funeral and imposing heavy exactions throughout Kievan Rus' to curry favor with the Golden Horde, he sparked the Kievan Rus' Civil War beginning in December 1443. The principalities of Galicia-Volhynia, the Zaporozhian Hetmanate, and Chernigov all declared independence, each claiming the right to become the new Grand Prince of Kievan Rus', plunging into a chaotic struggle for the city of Kiev. Meanwhile, the Prince of Turov and the Archbishop of Minsk watched from the sidelines, striving to defend against the northern Lithuanians without the protection of the Grand Prince of Kievan Rus."

In the early 15th century, the principality was re-established, and the princely title was granted to the most prominent local family—the Chernigov family, who ruled the city of Chernigov itself. Prince Yevgeny of Chernigov, who ascended in 1411, initially had no desire to contend for hegemony over Kievan Rus', but he was even more unwilling to submit to Galicia-Volhynia or Zaporozhia.

This formidable ruler, who originally had the opportunity to annihilate the southern Taifas, ultimately failed to achieve his great undertaking. Moreover, due to sharp internal conflicts, weak royal authority, and succession disputes, the united Kingdom of León-Castile-Asturias eventually dissolved into the three kingdoms of Galicia, Asturias, and Castile, which frequently clashed in the years that followed. Aware that his heirs could not maintain the kingdom's unity and recognizing the deep divisions among the nobility, Fernando III left a final testament before his death, hoping the King of Valencia would protect his descendants. This testament was sent to Valencia and remains displayed in the royal palace hall to this day. In 1344, the Kingdom of Galicia was attacked by the Kingdom of Asturias. King Alfonso XI of Galicia fell in battle, and the Galician nobility attempted to install the brutal King of Castile as King of Galicia in exchange for Castilian aid. After the King of Castile repelled the Asturian armies, Sebastián of Galicia staged a coup, seized state power, and held the cities until a rebellion within Castile forced the Castilian king to return home to deal with the threat. After the war, Sebastián became the first Consul of the Republic, and Galicia became a republic. The Reconquista failed to achieve effective results for a long time. The Christian coalition formed a combined army to attack the Taifa of Córdoba in 1403 but was defeated at Córdoba, with King João I of Valencia even perishing there. The situation in Iberia is complex and unpredictable. The struggle between Muslims and Christians is prolonged and deadlocked. This situation must change."
EDG_SPA_3_12_conquer_center_desc:0 "Fernando III's death caused the fragmentation of the Kingdom of León-Castile-Asturias. Now, Asturias lies in the north, while Castile occupies the center of all Iberia. She must either become the strongest kingdom or be destroyed by another."

However, it was not until October 30, 1499, that the judges of the city of Valencia incorporated the founding of the University of Valencia into the statutes of the city's court. The university's establishment was approved by Alexander VI, the Valencian Pope, who issued a papal bull on January 23, 1501, followed by royal decree from Ferdinand II on February 16, 1502."
EDG_SPA_3_17_develop_desc:0 "Avignon Cathedral, also known as the Historic Centre of Avignon, is located in the city of Avignon in southern France, which served as the seat of the Roman Popes in the 14th century. Covering a total area of 15,000 square meters, it consists of the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and the Palais Neuf (New Palace) connected together. Decorated by Simone Martini and Matteo Giovannetti, it occupies the majority of the city's area, surrounded by strong ramparts and the remains of the 12th-century Pont Saint-Bénézet. The Palais Neuf, built by Pope Clement VI, differs starkly in style from the Palais Vieux. Its design fully embodies the character of this 'Prince of the Church'—extravagant and profligate, constructing the palace in magnificent splendor, while his passion for art adorned it like a hall of artistic treasures."
EDG_SPA_3_18_develop_desc:0 "Christianity venerates Jerusalem not only for its role in the Old Testament but also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to biblical accounts, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem shortly after his birth and later cleansed the Second Temple. The site of the Last Supper is located on Mount Zion, adjacent to the Tomb of David. Another crucial Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, where Jesus was crucified. The Gospel of John merely states the place was outside Jerusalem's city walls, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha was located not far from the walls of the Old City, within the city's boundaries. The site is occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. For the past 2,000 years, Golgotha has been a premier Christian pilgrimage destination, and pilgrims often retrace Jesus' path along the Via Dolorosa in the Old City streets. Now, Jerusalem is back under our control."

During the Arab occupation from the 9th to the 13th centuries, the city of Palma basically formed its urban scale. In 1229, King James I of Aragon took the city from the Arabs and subsequently carried out large-scale renovations in the Gothic style. During the Middle Ages, with the development of maritime trade, numerous palaces were built in the old city district."

Alexandria became the capital of the Egyptian kingdom and quickly grew into the largest city in Hellenistic culture, second only to Rome in size and wealth in the ancient Western world. However, after Egypt's Islamic rulers established Cairo as the new capital of Egypt, Alexandria's status continually declined. By the end of the Ottoman Empire, it had almost dwindled to a small fishing village."
EDG_SPA_4_19_develop_desc:0 "The Church of the Virgin Mary, also known as the Hanging Church, is located in the Coptic Quarter of Old Cairo, Egypt.

The Hanging Church is arguably the most beautiful among all the churches here. Its snow-white towers and beautiful crosses, set against an azure sky, radiate the unique sanctity and brilliance of Christian churches.

Our institutions are rigid and lack vitality, consistently preventing our central government from strengthening control over the regions, even triggering rebellions in Bulgaria and Albania. Some stubborn conservatives within the country still believe we should maintain the old system. They revere the title 'Emperor of the Greeks' left by Stefan the Great, failing to realize that it is precisely this title that prevented us from focusing on mobilizing our own national strength. We can abandon the title 'Emperor of the Greeks,' or we can rely on talent to reform our political system."
EDG_emp_ser_1_5_desc:0 "We have already achieved many accomplishments, one of the most notable being the establishment of a South Slavic autocratic empire. This holds great symbolic significance for the Serbian people."
EDG_emp_ser_1_6_desc:0 "The difficulty of managing an empire is immense. The empire has an enormous demand for bureaucrats of certain quality. To meet the gap in administrative talent, perfecting imperial administrative doctrine is crucial. After completing 'The Treatise on Imperial Administration,' we established academies across the empire to train administrative talents, selecting imperial bureaucrats from this pool to ensure both their quality and quantity."
EDG_emp_ser_4_2_desc:0 "Due to the Tsar's lack of a son, a fierce struggle for the throne erupted in Bulgaria. The final victor of the civil war was Konstantin IV.

EDG_emp_ser_4_3_desc:0 "Skanderbeg of Albania and Duke Konstantin IV of Bulgaria formed an alliance, initiating a rebellion against Serbia. Konstantin IV then proclaimed himself Tsar, founding the Tsardom of Bulgaria. This is an intolerable act of high treason.

EDG_emp_ser_4_1_desc:0 "The Bulgarians and Albanians rebelled against our rule and launched war upon us. We are the Emperor, but relying solely on domestic forces cannot resolve this crisis.

The city itself sits upon a series of small hills, with the Sea of Marmara to the south, the Golden Horn to the north, the entrance to the Hellespont to the east, and overlooking the Thracian Plain from a commanding height to the west. Roman Emperor Constantine the Great rebuilt and expanded Byzantium on the edge of Europe, announcing the relocation of the capital to this strategically located city in AD 330, renaming it New Rome, also known as Constantinople, meaning 'City of Constantine.' From then on, this city began its glorious thousand-year history, with Constantine's name becoming one with the city. On January 17, AD 395, Emperor Theodosius I passed away, and the Roman Empire formally split into the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire. Constantinople, as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, became the political, economic, cultural, and religious center of the eastern Mediterranean. The Byzantines further constructed the Theodosian Walls here, making the entire urban area like a naturally fortified stronghold, easy to defend and hard to attack. Constantinople has long been the most resplendent jewel on the lands of Eastern Europe. Now she belongs to us, and we have renamed her 'Tsargrad,' symbolizing the rise of the Tsardom of Bulgaria—or more accurately, the rise of the Bulgarian Empire."

These non-Muslims had to acknowledge the supremacy of Islam and the dominant position of the Islamic state, accept certain social restrictions, and pay a poll tax (jizya) that Muslims were exempt from, to signify their acceptance of subordinate status.

EDG_per_mission_1_19_desc:0 "The early Persian Empire relied on undisciplined Turkmen nomadic tribal armies, which frequently rebelled. For contemporary Persian rulers, how to curb the expansion of Qizilbash power was the primary challenge after ascending the throne. With the help of the British adventurer Robert Shirley and under the direction of minister Allahverdi Khan, we utilized new weapons to equip a new army, making it the cornerstone for restraining tribal forces. The new standing army consisted of Royal Corps formed from Persian peasants and prisoners of war from the Caucasus region—Armenians, Georgians, Circassians—and their descendants. It primarily included artillery, musketeers, and infantry. The infantry numbered 12,000 per corps, cavalry 10,000 per corps, all equipped with firearms; the artillery reached 12,000 men, equipped with 500 bronze cannons."

Furthermore, Abbas reduced the number of Qizilbash in the army from the original 60,000-80,000 to 30,000, reversing the situation where Turkmen tribal nobles held significant military power, thus diminishing the influence of the Qizilbash within the military."

EDG_per_mission_2_18_desc:0 "The tense relationship between central and local authorities is key to understanding the Safavid regime's structure and political governance. The most fundamental problem of the Safavid state was that structurally it was a tribal confederation, making it highly unstable. The various tribes, with their autonomy, economic interests, and military ambitions, were distinct and often hostile to each other, frequently plunging the state into political disorder. They all opposed the establishment of a centralized state. Throughout the Safavid period, the most impactful political struggles were often within the ruling elite rather than power struggles between rulers and the ruled. This power struggle and the shifting balance were most clearly reflected in the degree of state centralization or decentralization, with the key being the relationship between the Shah and the Qizilbash tribes. This state structure of Persia is highly precarious; we must weaken local power."
EDG_per_mission_2_19_desc:0 "Below the Shah was the Supreme Council, convened by the Shah and composed of military nobles from various nomadic tribes, bureaucrats, and representatives of the ulema appointed by the Shah. The official next in rank to the Shah was the 'Grand Vizier.' Acting as the Shah's deputy, the Grand Vizier was usually held by Persian nobles, wielding immense power and controlling national affairs. Next was the 'Amir al-Umara,' the Commander-in-Chief of the army; followed by the 'Sadr al-Sudur,' the upholder of the Shah's decrees and legal advisor on Islamic matters. Additionally, there were ministers in charge of finance and other departments. The Council of Ministers only had advisory power; final decisions rested with the Shah. However, the Grand Vizier was always the supreme leader of the cabinet. Yet we need to make some changes, weakening the Grand Vizier's power to strengthen the monarchy."

The purpose of Nizam al-Mulk's reforms was to consolidate the Qajar dynasty's rule, which imposed significant limitations; it was impossible to eliminate the inherent corruption of feudal dynasties. Moreover, Nizam was only able to implement his reform measures with the support of the young king. His reforms infringed upon the interests of the royal nobility, local officials, various khans, mid-to-high-level military and administrative officials, as well as the upper echelons of the monasteries and religious establishment, and also curbed the interests of European powers."

Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni invaded India over twelve times, causing severe destruction in northern India. The Ghaznavid territories in Central Asia were annexed in 1173 by their former vassal, the Ghurid dynasty of Afghanistan. The Ghurid ruler Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad decisively defeated the Rajput Chahamanas in the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192; his governor left in India, Qutb al-Din Aibak, adopted the title of Sultan in 1206 to rule the Muslim-conquered northern Indian regions, establishing his capital at Delhi. From then until the establishment of the Mughal Empire, the history of northern India was that of the Delhi Sultanate, until its collapse in the mid-15th century plunged India into a brief power vacuum. The power vacuum caused by the Delhi Sultanate's disintegration did not last long. New conquerors soon appeared in the northwest. We have the hope of becoming the new hegemon to unify India.

From the 13th to 15th centuries AD, due to events like the Mongol invasions, Persia and the entire Islamic eastern world fell into chaos, and the Ghulam system gradually declined. In the 16th century AD, Persia regained its statehood. To balance the increasingly powerful Qizilbash forces within the country, they established 'Qurchi' (Royal Guard), but the new Ghulam differed in many ways from the previous ones."

Because five dynasties successively ruled from Delhi, and these dynasties' capitals were always located in Delhi, they were collectively called the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nSultan Muhammad of the Ghurid dynasty was assassinated in 1206, leading to the fragmentation of his state. The governor of India, Qutb al-Din Aibak, became independent as Sultan with Delhi as the center, hence the name Delhi Sultanate.

They held large military fiefs called 'Iqta' and relied on foreign Central Asian mercenaries as pillars of rule. They adopted oppressive policies of hostility, discrimination, and persecution against Hindu feudal lords and various strata of the broader population, imposing the jizya (poll tax) and forced conversion to Islam, which stimulated the national sentiments and religious emotions of the Hindu strata.\n\nNow Delhi is under our control.

EDG_per_mission_4_19_desc:0 "Isfahan is one of Iran's oldest cities, built during the Achaemenid Empire in the 4th-5th centuries BC, and served as a capital multiple times. It was a crucial passageway for north-south travel and a famous center for handicrafts and trade. The name 'Isfahan' originates from the Persian 'Spahan,' meaning 'army.' In ancient times, it was an army gathering place, hence the name. During the Seljuk Empire in the 11th-12th centuries AD, the city was the capital. In the Safavid period, the city reached its zenith, with merchants and visitors gathering from all directions; most buildings and mosques in the city were constructed then. There is a Persian proverb, 'Isfahan is half the world,' reflecting the city's prosperity and far-reaching influence at that time. Isfahan existed as early as the Median Kingdom. In the mid-6th century BC, it became a major city under Cyrus the Great's Achaemenid Empire. It suffered damage during the invasion by Alexander the Great's Macedonian army in 330 BC but was later restored. It was an important town during the Seleucid, Arsacid, and Sasanian empires. When the Arab Caliphate captured Isfahan in 640 AD, it was again damaged but later restored; Islamic-style architecture subsequently appeared, beginning an era of prosperity and brilliance in the Islamic period. Isfahan served as the capital of the Seljuk Empire from 1051 to 1118. In 1387, it was captured and ravaged by Timur, who massacred 70,000 people. Later, in 1453, Isfahan was rebuilt, and its glory peaked in the 17th century under the Safavid Empire, with a population reaching 600,000, making it Persia's capital for the second time. Today, Isfahan is a cultural ancient capital of Iran, and its Naqsh-e Jahan Square is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
EDG_per_mission_4_20_desc:0 "As early as the 18th century BC, the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi mentioned Baghdad (meaning 'God-given') as an important stronghold. In Chinese historical records, the Arab Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258 AD), known as the 'Black-Clothed Arabs,' initially had its capital at Anbar. The second caliph of this dynasty, al-Mansur (754-775 AD), deemed Anbar unsuitable for a capital. He personally surveyed and selected a small town on the right bank of the Tigris called Baghdad, deciding to establish a new capital there. After four years of construction, the new capital was completed and named 'Madinat as-Salam,' meaning 'City of Peace,' serving as the capital of the Arab Caliphate. The city was circular, hence called the 'Round City.' It consisted of three layers: outer city, inner city, and royal city, with three walls. With the royal city as the center, the walls formed three concentric circles. Each wall had four equidistant gates, with four main streets radiating from the center to the gates, resembling wheel spokes. The royal city contained palaces, official residences, mosques, libraries, gardens, etc. In 830 AD, Caliph al-Ma'mun established the 'House of Wisdom' in Baghdad, a state academic research institution that gathered renowned scholars of different ethnicities and religious beliefs, collecting, organizing, and translating classical works from Greece, Persia, India, and other regions into Arabic, promoting the development of Arabic science and culture. From the 9th to 11th centuries, Islamic scholarship in Baghdad flourished. Sufism, Mu'tazila, Ash'arism, and Arabic linguistic schools were very active. Scholars of various sects, sponsored and protected by the court, authored books and made significant achievements in Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic jurisprudence, Kalam (theology), literature, and arts. It is recorded that Baghdad once had over 30 various religious schools. Among them, the Nizamiyya University established by Seljuk Vizier Nizam al-Mulk in the 11th century and the Mustansiriya University founded by the Caliph in the 13th century were most famous, producing many renowned scholars and officials. Along with Cairo and Córdoba, it was known as one of the three great cultural cities of the Islamic world."
EDG_per_mission_5_12_desc:0 "The Qanat is an underground hydraulic engineering system created by the laboring people of arid regions over a long historical development. Qanats extract groundwater, turning deserts into oases, and were called 'well-canals' in ancient times. The main working principle of a qanat is that people channel a large amount of rainwater, glacier meltwater, and snowmelt that seep underground during spring and summer seasons to the surface for irrigation, utilizing the natural slope of mountains, to meet production and domestic water needs in desert areas. Qanat systems in different regions have specific local characteristics in their construction, but generally, a complete qanat system includes four main components: vertical shafts, underground channels (subterranean conduits), surface channels (open canals), and small reservoirs (settling basins).

EDG_per_mission_5_14_desc:0 "The Ghulam were a type of army in medieval Central Asia, West Asia, and South Asia, originating from the Persian word 'Ghulam,' meaning 'trained slave.' This was a professional elite force. Historical Turkic-Persian empires such as the Samanids, Ghaznavids, Kara-Khanids, Seljuks, Ghurids, and Khwarazmians all established Ghulam units. From the 13th to 15th centuries AD, due to events like the Mongol invasions, Persia and the entire Islamic eastern world fell into chaos, and the Ghulam system gradually declined. In the 16th century AD, Persia regained its statehood. To balance the increasingly powerful Qizilbash forces within the country, they established 'Qurchi' (Royal Guard), but the new Ghulam differed in many ways from the previous ones."
EDG_per_mission_5_15_desc:0 "Persia's location between the developing Europe, Central Asia, and India served as a bridge, bringing economic development. In the 16th century, the Silk Road to India revived, passing through northern Iran. Shah Abbas I also directly supported trade with Europe. Particularly, the British and Dutch greatly appreciated Iranian carpets, silk, and textiles. Other exports included horses, wool, pearls, and almonds used as spices in India. Main imports were coins, textiles, spices, metals, coffee, and sugar."
EDG_per_mission_5_16_desc:0 "The state's fiscal power has long been controlled by the great nobles, significantly constraining our national financial system. If we reform our tax system, we can collect taxes more efficiently. During Abbas's reign, taxation became the primary source of state revenue. He overhauled taxation nationwide, codifying the tax system into books, and taxes across almost all regions were directly levied according to laws promulgated by the central government. At that time, the total national tax revenue was approximately 785,623 tumans, while government expenditures totaled 491,796 tumans. Consequently, there was a substantial surplus in the government budget. This surplus was kept in the treasury for the king's use as needed. By distributing fiscal revenue among various strata, the government further strengthened its control over the administrative apparatus. To alleviate the economic burden on the poor, Abbas also ordered the exemption of certain taxes."
EDG_per_mission_5_18_desc:0 "During the reign of Abbas I, Persian handicrafts also experienced unprecedented development. Abbas extensively built factories and schools, widely attracting talent. According to records, the carpet factory in Isfahan was enormous, employing up to 25,000 workers alone. Besides hiring domestic workers, he also introduced numerous foreign talents, such as hiring 300 Chinese artisans skilled in porcelain making, who settled in Isfahan and other places with their families. Abbas's economic policies led to the emergence of capitalist sprouts in the Safavid dynasty, bringing prosperity unseen since the Mongol invasions."
EDG_per_mission_5_19_desc:0 "Samarkand is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia, with records dating back to the 5th century BC. The commercially adept Sogdians built Samarkand into a magnificent capital. In the 4th century BC, when Alexander the Great of the Macedonian Empire captured the city, he exclaimed: 'Everything I have heard is true, only Samarkand is more magnificent than I imagined.' In 1219, Samarkand was the new capital and cultural center of the Khwarazmian Empire. After its capture by Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire, it suffered catastrophic destruction. Most buildings in the city were later constructed by order of Timur. With the rise of the Timurid Empire, his armies swept through Persia, India, the Caucasus, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia. He vowed to make Samarkand the capital of Asia, piling treasures plundered from across Asia in Samarkand, bringing the most skilled artisans from every city to Samarkand, and erecting the most splendid palaces and mosques in the city."
EDG_per_mission_5_20_desc:0 "In the 10th century, many Islamic geographers described Ray in detail in their writings. Although Arabs hoped to replicate Baghdad's prosperity in Ray, they were isolated and weak there, while Persians permeated all social strata. The Oghuz Turks abandoned Ray in 1035 and 1042, but Ray recovered during the Seljuk and Khwarazmian periods. According to Islamic historians of the time, the Mongols massacred Ray's inhabitants and completely abandoned the city. In Sassanian chronicles, Ray had already become a secondary city. The origin of Tehran's name is unclear. It was a village in the 9th century, but less famous than the then more prosperous Ray. Sufi scholar Najm al-Din Razi estimated Ray's population before the Mongol invasion at 500,000. In the 13th century, after the Mongols destroyed Ray, many residents fled to Tehran. In some early texts, it was called 'Tehran of Ray.' Geographer Hamdollah Mostowfi described Tehran as a notable village in his 'Nuz'hat al-Qulub.' Castilian envoy Ruy González de Clavijo was likely the first European to visit Tehran, passing through in July 1404 en route to Timur's capital Samarkand (in present-day Uzbekistan). At that time, Timur controlled Iran, and Tehran still had no protective walls. In the early 18th century, Karim Khan ordered the construction of a palace and government offices in Tehran, perhaps to indicate Tehran as the capital, but later moved the government offices to Shiraz. In 1796, Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty was crowned king, and Tehran became the capital."

EDG_adu_mission_1_17_desc:0 "In 1071, the Seljuks achieved a stunning victory against the Byzantine army at Manzikert in present-day Turkey, turning most of Anatolia into Turkish-occupied territory. Around the same time, they successfully seized Jerusalem from the Muslim rulers of Egypt. These two major events shocked the Byzantines, the Papacy, and Europeans, ultimately triggering the Crusades that lasted for over two hundred years.\n\nAlthough the Seljuk Turks eventually regained control of Palestine, their strength was depleted by continuous warfare against the Crusades. Moreover, they were threatened by the activities of their opponents. Internally, Sufi mysticism became highly prevalent, ushering Islam into a period of introspection. It was during this era of exhaustion and weakness that they abruptly collapsed under the Mongol invasions. Baghdad fell to the invaders in 1258, and the Turkmen empire disappeared.\n\nIn the early 14th century, Muslim peoples from Anatolia united under the rule of Sultan Osman I, proudly calling themselves 'Turks' or 'Ottomans' in the name of honor. The Turks launched holy wars to crush the Byzantine Empire, waging campaigns in the Balkan Peninsula and Greece surrounding Constantinople. Since then, the Turks have played an extremely important role in West Asia, renowned for their martial prowess, once campaigning north and south to establish a powerful empire. But now, the Turkish Sultans and pseudo-caliphs have bowed before our military might, offering water and earth in tribute, paying homage to Córdoba. We have become their Caliph."

    
EDG_adu_religion_1_2_desc:0 "Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam, is a collective term for numerous organizations that impart esoteric meanings to Islamic faith and practice asceticism and rigorous spiritual exercises, also known as Sufiism.

The term 'Sufi' officially appeared in Arabic literature in the mid-9th century. By the 11th century, ascetics among Muslims were commonly called 'Sufis.' Arab Islamic scholars refer to its members as 'Mutassawwif.' Since the decline of the Almoravid dynasty, Sufi orders have gradually become active in Iberia, with many expanding their influence.

However, they have close ties with merchants from Pisa, Genoa, and Sardinia, monopolizing trade on the western Mediterranean coast and controlling vast wealth. The Taifa of Granada has long been at a competitive disadvantage in the Iberian Peninsula. Granada's neighbors, both Muslim and Christian states, covet its territory. Consequently, the Taifa of Granada had to seek help from the Almería Brotherhood, giving the Brotherhood significant political influence within Granada. In recent years, the incompetence of the Taifa of Granada and its precarious situation forced the Brotherhood to assume more power, eventually leading to political struggle with the Taifa of Granada."

EDG_BDH_special_Missions_4_3_desc:0 "The fall of the Iberian Christian kingdoms forced northern Christians to retreat into the mountains of Asturias, becoming the forefront of the future Reconquista. However, the vast majority of Christians and clergy still lived under Moorish rule. Muslim rulers called these people 'Mozarabs.' Although existing as a Dhimmi class, they were forbidden from public displays of faith and building new churches, possibly fostering the conservative ethos of the Mozarabic Rite later. As the Reconquista unfolded, northern Christians began to counterattack and liberate old territories. Some Mozarabs started fleeing back to liberated areas to rebuild abandoned towns and replenish the lost population, notably the Kingdom of León, reorganized from the Kingdom of Asturias in 910. While expanding their influence, Iberian Christians also re-established connections with the Pope and other European nations. The Catalan region liberated by Charlemagne was the first to adopt the Roman Rite instead of the traditional local Spanish liturgy. As northern Christians became orthodox, southern Mozarabs grew increasingly conservative, striving to preserve the most original Spanish liturgical traditions. Senior scribes within Mozarab communities wrote manuscripts in Visigothic script, keeping the Mozarabic Rite distinct from northern Christians. However, during the Reconquista, northern Catholic kingdoms continuously made agreements with the Mozarabs, promising not to forcibly impose the Roman Rite in exchange for their support of the Reconquista. This indirectly threatened us. Therefore, we need to promulgate a forward-looking act to ensure the loyalty of Mozarab adherents to us."
EDG_BDH_special_Missions_4_4_desc:0 "Mozarab adherents are protected by us and have consistently submitted to our rule, becoming staunch supporters of the Taifa. Given the substantial political and economic resources controlled by the Mozarab community, we should also grant them more benefits."

Their descendants became the successive princes of Polotsk, including the great Vseslav, who campaigned east and west, once sacking Novgorod, purged domestic reactionary forces, and established a powerful guard fully accountable to the army.

The Lithuanians are tough and resolute. Although conquered, they still preserve their own culture and traditions, even relying on their own resources and political power to secure a place within the system of [Root.GetName].\n\nAfter the political situation stabilized, a Polish nobleman proposed a bold motion. At a private gathering, he suggested to guests from Lithuania whether the two states could form a commonwealth to enhance cooperation and interaction between them.\n\nThe attending nobles were all shocked upon hearing this proposal; silence, rather than uproar, persisted the longest in the hall. Finally, a young Lithuanian noble expressed his opinion. He believed this proposal was very meaningful, as it could promote economic and cultural exchange between the two countries while also strengthening their ability to resist surrounding powers. He believed that if a Sacred Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth could be established, the federal system would help enhance the strength and status of both nations, enabling them to face challenges together in the future years and welcome a brighter future.\n\nHowever, some held different views, believing that historical issues and geopolitical contradictions between the two countries made genuine cooperation difficult. Nevertheless, many considered the proposal worth trying, especially since both Poland and Lithuania were in unstable periods requiring more support and joint action."
