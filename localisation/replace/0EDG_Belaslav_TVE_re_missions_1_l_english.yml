EDG_ERS_1_1_title:0 "Reactionary Zeal"
EDG_ERS_1_1_desc:0 "The Smolensk regime is a malignant tumor harming Rus'. Before unifying Rus', we must be clear about one thing: whoever unifies Rus', it must not be the Smolensk regime. Smolensk must be destroyed!"

EDG_ERS_1_2_title:0 "Proclamation on the Unification of Rus'"
EDG_ERS_1_2_desc:0 "Unification is the will of the Rus' people. The southern princes can accomplish nothing beyond fighting over Kiev. The era of Kiev is over. We shall march south from Northeastern Rus' to end the foolish age of fragmented principalities."

EDG_ERS_1_3_title:0 "Annihilate the Kievan Regime"
EDG_ERS_1_3_desc:0 "As we said, the era of Kiev is over... If some fail to recognize this, we will help them understand..."

EDG_ERS_1_4_title:0 "The Historical Significance of Kiev"
EDG_ERS_1_4_desc:0 "Although we have occupied Kiev, we do not possess absolute claim to it. However, now that we have demonstrated our power to all of Rus', we can slightly adjust the phrasing in the history books. After all, history is written by the living; the dead cannot speak."

EDG_ERS_1_5_title:0 "Grand Prince of All Rus'"
EDG_ERS_1_5_desc:0 "The era of warring states and mutual vengeance is over. All Rus' people are united under one banner. A new Rus' is rising! One people! One state! One Grand Prince!"

EDG_ERS_1_7_title:0 "The Chud Pact"
EDG_ERS_1_7_desc:0 "The Chud people, the main inhabitants of the present-day Livonia region, were once our vassals in Rus'. However, they are now ruled by Germans, and these Germans have the audacity to attack Rus'. Now that the lands of Rus' are unified, it is time to drive out these Germans and re-establish our rule over the Chud people!"

EDG_ERS_1_8_title:0 "Annihilate the Teutonic Order"
EDG_ERS_1_8_desc:0 "So-called German knights, it turns out, are nothing more than this. Any German shall be brought to justice!"

EDG_ERS_1_9_title:0 "The City on the Neva"
EDG_ERS_1_9_desc:0 "There, by the vast sea waves, the river flows broadly; lonely skiffs rock upon the swells, desolate and alone. Along the moss-covered, damp banks, dark huts stand scattered here and there, where impoverished Finns find shelter. The sun hides behind a thick fog. Forests that have never seen sunlight murmur all around. From here, we shall threaten Sweden. Here, we shall build a fortress to humble the arrogant neighbor. Nature has set a window here; we shall open it towards Europe. Right by the sea, we shall stand firm. The sails of nations will gather to journey on these new sea lanes, and we shall rejoice across the sea and sky."

EDG_ERS_1_10_title:0 "Conquer the Suomi Tribes"
EDG_ERS_1_10_desc:0 "The Finnish region has long been contested between Novgorod and Sweden. It holds sufficient strategic value and also produces furs. To vie with Sweden for Baltic hegemony, we must seize Finland."

EDG_ERS_1_11_title:0 "Rus' Baltic Hegemony"
EDG_ERS_1_11_desc:0 "Long, long ago, our ancestors sailed these seas. And now, the Baltic Sea shall become our sea!"

EDG_ERS_2_2_title:0 "Protect Perm"
EDG_ERS_2_2_desc:0 "As Rus' expanded eastward, we encountered Perm. Compared to Rus', Perm is weak, threatened by Muslims. They should understand this: only Rus' can protect them."

EDG_ERS_2_3_title:0 "Principality of Ryazan"
EDG_ERS_2_3_desc:0 "The Principality of Ryazan is an ancient Rus' principality, but it lies too far from Rus' and too close to the steppe, hindering its significant development. We share countless ties. Perhaps we can attempt a peaceful annexation, learning from their experience against steppe peoples... but if necessary, we can also resort to force for the unification of Rus'."

EDG_ERS_2_4_title:0 "End the Special Status of White Rus'"
EDG_ERS_2_4_desc:0 "White Rus' has long drifted apart from Rus'. Though we were once kin, that connection has faded with time. Fortunately, we still recognize the rule of Rurik, and we share a common identity—Rus' people. We can attempt a peaceful annexation and learn from their experience fighting in marshlands and forests. Of course, if necessary, for the unification of Rus', we will not hesitate to resort to force without reservation."

EDG_ERS_2_5_title:0 "Tatars in Rus'"
EDG_ERS_2_5_desc:0 "The Tatars are useful to Rus', especially their skilled cavalry tactics, which can help Rus' achieve victory on the battlefield. However, favoring the Tatars may provoke discontent among the domestic Cossacks. We need to carefully deliberate on which group to rely upon."

EDG_ERS_2_6_title:0 "Reform the All-Rus' Legal Code"
EDG_ERS_2_6_desc:0 "Reform is necessary. The old system must not bind the people of the new era! The new era of Rus' demands new laws."

EDG_ERS_2_7_title:0 "The Court of Rus'"
EDG_ERS_2_7_desc:0 "Within our court, three factions have long existed: the Westernizers, the Traditionalists, and the Autocrats (or alternatively, the Easternizers). However, the struggle among them does not determine which faction holds sway in the court. The favor of the Grand Prince is the dominant factor in their influence over the court."

EDG_ERS_2_9_title:0 "Expand Rus'"
EDG_ERS_2_9_desc:0 "The scope of Rus' territory has never been fixed. Thanks to our experience in expansion, we can now expand while simultaneously establishing governance!"

EDG_ERS_3_1_title:0 "The Rule of the Grand Prince"
EDG_ERS_3_1_desc:0 "Under the rule of the Grand Prince, the people have enjoyed enduring peace, creating a scene full of vitality and prosperity. The people live and work in contentment, with even better days still ahead."

EDG_ERS_3_2_title:0 "Clearing the Forests"
EDG_ERS_3_2_desc:0 "The forests of Northeastern Rus' are vast. In the past, these forests served as our refuge against nomads. But now that we have cast off the shadow of the Tatars, these forests have instead become obstacles to our development. However, this does not mean the Rus' people will retreat. We will bravely face difficulties and carve out our homeland!"

EDG_ERS_3_3_title:0 "The Breadbasket of Rus'"
EDG_ERS_3_3_desc:0 "Grain is of paramount importance. With sufficient grain, we can maintain national stability and support a vast army. Grain and farmers are the foundation of national power."

EDG_ERS_3_5_title:0 "State Vodka Monopoly"
EDG_ERS_3_5_desc:0 "The people of Rus' are fond of drink. Vodka is an inexpensive liquor, and we should monopolize it through state institutions. This will not only generate revenue but also prove useful in other areas."

EDG_ERS_3_6_title:0 "Religious Zeal in Rus'"
EDG_ERS_3_6_desc:0 "The Rus' people are fervent and superstitious towards the Orthodox faith. The Orthodox Church, working closely with the state, can effectively control the populace."

EDG_ERS_3_7_title:0 "The Silver Age of Rus'"
EDG_ERS_3_7_desc:0 "Although Rus' once fell into decline, shackled by the Tatar yoke, the suffering has passed. A glorious era has arrived. Rus' will be great once again!"

EDG_ERS_3_8_title:0 "Reform the Streltsy"
EDG_ERS_3_8_desc:0 "The Streltsy, armed with firearms, emerged early, but they lacked unified standards and centralized deployment. We must utilize them more effectively. However, regarding how to use the Streltsy, we have two distinct paths... By establishing the Streltsy, we will learn how to form elite regiments."

EDG_ERS_3_10_title:0 "Dominate the Fur Trade"
EDG_ERS_3_10_desc:0 "Fur, also known as 'soft gold' in the north and Siberia. The demand for high-quality fur never dries up. We must certainly monopolize the fur trade."

EDG_ERS_4_2_title:0 "Rus' Architectural Regulations"
EDG_ERS_4_2_desc:0 "Construction projects are booming across Rus'. We need unified building standards to significantly reduce construction costs."

EDG_ERS_4_6_title:0 "Prospering Day by Day"
EDG_ERS_4_6_desc:0 "Rus' national power is flourishing daily. We should also construct some great projects to showcase the Grand Prince's magnificent achievements."

EDG_ERS_4_8_title:0 "Cossacks and the Court"
EDG_ERS_4_8_desc:0 "We must ensure the Cossacks' loyalty to the court, or they may well become part of the rebels..."

EDG_ERS_4_9_title:0 "Messengers to Constantinople"
EDG_ERS_4_9_desc:0 "The rulers of Constantinople are always changing, but this does not affect our diplomatic policy—Constantinople should submit to the will of Rus'."

EDG_ERS_5_1_title:0 "Conquer Kazan"
EDG_ERS_5_1_desc:0 "Kazan is a crucial node on Rus' eastern trade routes. After centuries of conflict with us Rus' people, it is time to end the war, for victory shall be ours!"

EDG_ERS_5_2_title:0 "Shatter the Tatar Yoke"
EDG_ERS_5_2_desc:0 "Since the Mongol conquest, Rus' has harbored a peculiar fear of the steppe peoples. The so-called Tatars could easily raid Rus' cities, burning them, plundering people and wealth, before riding off. Although no Tatars actually do so anymore, we must achieve a decisive victory over them to declare that our past humiliation is washed away. We must tell the Rus' that the era when Tatars could simply ride into Rus' and return laden with spoils is gone forever!"

EDG_ERS_5_4_title:0 "Conquer the Steppe"
EDG_ERS_5_4_desc:0 "The vast steppes have nurtured numerous Tatar nomads. Now, this great expanse shall become Rus' territory. The steppe shall become new pastures, farmlands, and estates to nourish our Rus' people."

EDG_ERS_5_6_title:0 "To the Shores of the Black Sea"
EDG_ERS_5_6_desc:0 "The Crimean steppes and the Crimean Peninsula along the Black Sea coast are vital passages for Rus' trade into the Black Sea. For the interests of Rus', we must control Crimea and establish it as a base to build a powerful navy."

EDG_ERS_5_7_title:0 "Construct Sevastopol"
EDG_ERS_5_7_desc:0 "Sevastopol is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and an excellent port—perfect for our naval base. We must build it well."

EDG_ERS_5_8_title:0 "Black Sea Fleet"
EDG_ERS_5_8_desc:0 "A powerful Black Sea Fleet is our maritime guarantee when facing Black Sea powers."

EDG_ERS_5_9_title:0 "Straight to the Ural Mountains"
EDG_ERS_5_9_desc:0 "Crossing the Ural Mountains, Cossack hunters can bring back high-quality furs that sell as far as the Western European market... Regardless, these treasures must belong to Rus'!"

EDG_ERS_5_11_title:0 "Advance into Siberia!"
EDG_ERS_5_11_desc:0 "Siberia's wealth attracts fortune-seekers and the ambitious, while its environment, so different from Europe, also draws exploratory Rus' spirits."

EDG_ERS_A_1_title:0 "Imperial Ambition"
EDG_ERS_A_1_desc:0 "We have grown into a true hegemony that makes the world tremble. It is time to showcase our strength to the world; the old powers must step down."

EDG_ERS_1_13_title:0 "The Birth of Pan-Slavism"
EDG_ERS_1_13_desc:0 "In ancient legend, the three brothers Lech, Czech, and Rus formed the Czech, Polish, and Rus peoples respectively. Although this is merely a legend, we can easily recognize many shared characteristics among the Slavic peoples. We should be closely united brothers."

EDG_ERS_1_14_title:0 "The Elder Brother of the Slavic Peoples"
EDG_ERS_1_14_desc:0 "We are the most powerful and accomplished Slavic nation, and thus we rightfully become the leader of the Slavic world, the elder brother of all Slavs."

EDG_ERS_2_12_title:0 "Neither Holy, Nor Roman"
EDG_ERS_2_12_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is neither holy, nor Roman, and henceforth it shall no longer be an empire!"

EDG_ERS_2_13_title:0 "The Saxon Marches"
EDG_ERS_2_13_desc:0 "Historically, the Germans once demarcated a border with the Slavs at the Elbe River, but later they crossed that border and launched attacks against the Slavs. It is time for them to repay that debt."

EDG_ERS_2_14_title:0 "The Rebirth of the Wends"
EDG_ERS_2_14_desc:0 "Wends, or Polabian Slavs, our brothers and sisters, you should reappear in this world!"

EDG_ERS_2_15_title:0 "Slavic Invasion"
EDG_ERS_2_15_desc:0 "Hey, Germans, your days of attacking Slavs whenever you please are over! Hand over the land!"

EDG_ERS_3_14_title:0 "The Gallic Campaigns"
EDG_ERS_3_14_desc:0 "When Caesar led his armies to conquer Gaul, we too should be prepared, right?"

EDG_ERS_3_15_title:0 "Crossing the Channel"
EDG_ERS_3_15_desc:0 "The English Channel is but a shallow ditch. We must let the British know: from the British coast to Siberia, Rus' is the mightiest in the world!"

EDG_ERS_4_12_title:0 "Entering Constantinople"
EDG_ERS_4_12_desc:0 "Constantinople... Hah... The city desired by the world in my hands? How could I have such a dream?"

EDG_ERS_4_13_title:0 "The Legacy of the Byzantine Empire"
EDG_ERS_4_13_desc:0 "The Byzantine Empire may have faded, but its claims remain. In the name of the Byzantine Empire, we shall protect the Orthodox people!"

EDG_ERS_4_15_title:0 "Invading Iberia"
EDG_ERS_4_15_desc:0 "The Romans colonized Iberia during their rise. Now that we have entered the Mediterranean, the Iberian Peninsula is also our western gateway."

EDG_ERS_5_12_title:0 "Advancing Inland"
EDG_ERS_5_12_desc:0 "The heart of Eurasia, connecting the world's knowledge, goods, and commodity flows. The wealth of the distant East, India, and the Celestial Empire is known to all. Now, it is time to set out towards that wealth."

EDG_ERS_5_13_title:0 "Rus' Land Has No Borders"
EDG_ERS_5_13_desc:0 "If anyone asks where the borders of Rus' lie, my answer is: Rus' land has no borders!"

EDG_ERS_5_14_title:0 "Connecting the World"
EDG_ERS_5_14_desc:0 "The world is united. Information and logistics can no longer be obstructed. This is a new era!"
