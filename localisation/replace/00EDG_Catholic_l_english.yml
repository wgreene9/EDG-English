Catholic theology holds that after a faithful sinner obtains forgiveness from God through confession, the Church may remit the temporal punishment due to sin, known as 'indulgence.' Catholicism teaches that Christ's crucifixion holds immeasurable merit, and that the Virgin Mary and the saints have also accumulated many 'good works,' exceeding what was needed for their own atonement. These are gathered to form the Church's 'Treasury of Merit.' The Church has the authority to grant some of this merit from the Treasury when a penitent's good works are insufficient for full atonement, to offset the debt of punishment. Lay believers typically needed to purchase indulgences to obtain this merit. As members of the Catholic Church, we have the right to peddle indulgences to the faithful within our realm."

EDG_flavorCatholic.2.d:0 "Although indulgences were once prohibited for being seen as a source of corruption, they have proven indispensable to the Church. To maintain the Church's operations and the stability of the universal Church, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has announced the reauthorization for clergy to freely peddle indulgences."

EDG_flavorCatholic.3.t:0 "The Pope Prohibits the Sale of Indulgences"
EDG_flavorCatholic.3.d:0 "Corruption has long plagued the entire universal Church. In modern contexts, indulgences often symbolize Church corruption.

The Church has the authority to grant some of this merit from the Treasury when a penitent's good works are insufficient for full atonement, to offset the debt of punishment. Lay believers typically needed to purchase indulgences to obtain this merit, which was originally the Church's way of aiding the faithful. However, many clergy members have abused their authority, wantonly peddling indulgences to amass great wealth. This has made indulgences almost synonymous with Church corruption and a tool for Reformationists to criticize the Church. To eradicate Church corruption, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has announced a prohibition on clergy freely peddling indulgences."
