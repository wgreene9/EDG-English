EDG_BTA_mission_1_12_title:0 "Gleaming Snows"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_12_desc:0 "Following the sea routes of old Norse sagas, our small vessel pitched and rolled its way toward the fabled shores they called 'Vinland'. Just as our explorers were beginning to despair, they glimpsed the snow-capped mountains of a New World. There could be no doubt - the legends were true."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_13_title:0 "Thirteen Colonies"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_13_desc:0 "In December 1606, a small ship carrying 150 souls pitched and rolled its way from the British Isles toward the American coast. After 144 grueling days at sea, and at the cost of 40 lives, the colonists finally made landfall. Little did they know, as pioneers, the monumental enterprise they would initiate: beginning from a tiny Jamestown, to the Thirteen Colonies along the eastern seaboard of North America."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_15_title:0 "Controlling the Mississippi"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_15_desc:0 "In the Algonquian tongue, 'Mississippi' means 'Great River'. This mighty river flows from Lake Itasca, surging southward to the Gulf of Mexico. If we can master this Mother River of the Americas, we can further extend our control over all the North American colonies, thereby commanding the wealth of the continent."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_16_title:0 "Mastery of North America"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_16_desc:0 "North America is Scotland's America. Goods roll off the production lines, crops from the plantations along the great rivers are harvested from the fields and transported to the nearest ports, where they are crated and loaded onto pitching and rolling merchant sails bound for the continent to the east. And from Britain, there is always a fresh wave of immigrants, eager and ready to board ships and carve out a new destiny in the New World."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_19_title:0 "Setting Foot on the Ivory Coast"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_19_desc:0 "The West African coast, once desolate, is now a bustling hub of commerce. Black women bearing goods atop their heads unload their wares, chattering animatedly as they trade with pale-skinned foreigners, before returning home with novel and advanced products. Our merchants have already established outposts on the Ivory Coast, channeling Africa's bounty ceaselessly back to our homeland."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_21_title:0 "Madagascar"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_21_desc:0 "The island of Madagascar lies off the southeastern tip of Africa, coming into view once one rounds the Cape of Good Hope. By seizing control of Madagascar, we can command the passage through the Mozambique Channel, thereby monopolizing our trade to the Orient. Furthermore, it can serve as a supply station for long-distance merchant voyages, allowing crews to rest and replenish their stores."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_22_title:0 "Spice Islands"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_22_desc:0 "If European explorers discovered tangible gold in South America, then we can say we have discovered intangible gold. The abundance of produce in the Spice Islands is breathtaking - cloves, nutmeg, mace, pepper, all are here in plenty. For a spice-starved Europe, these are undoubtedly a colossal fortune, and naturally, they promise to bring us immense wealth as well."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_25_title:0 "National Admiralty"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_25_desc:0 "Whether to safeguard trade in the North Sea and Northern Europe, or to protect our nation's extensive maritime borders, we must possess a powerful navy. We should enhance the tactical prowess of our fleet and bolster its overall strength. To this end, we must establish a National Admiralty."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_27_title:0 "Naval Rank System"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_27_desc:0 "Although we have established a naval framework and created a National Admiralty for its administration, the promotion of naval officers and the assessment of individual command capability remain highly disordered. Therefore, we should institute a comprehensive naval rank system to facilitate the selection and cultivation of talent."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_28_title:0 "Maritime Department" # Maritime Military Department
EDG_BTA_mission_1_28_desc:0 "Many of our early vessels were simply converted from merchant ships or other civilian craft, resulting in a navy of highly uneven quality. We must establish a Maritime Military Department, dedicated to building a true system of warships, so that we may gain the upper hand in engagements with the enemy."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_30_title:0 "Naval Regulations"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_30_desc:0 "Our early naval administration was chaotic, with maritime affairs often handled based on custom and the personal discretion of sailors and officers. This is clearly detrimental to our management efforts and the professionalization and standardization of the navy. We must establish a comprehensive set of naval regulations to standardize all naval matters."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_33_title:0 "Enclosure Movement"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_33_desc:0 "The development of industry requires both land and people. Our nation has a multitude of small peasants bound to their land, engaged only in subsistence labor. We should 'liberate' them from the soil, let them see the wider world, and contribute to our nation's progress."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_34_title:0 "The Oxford Pasturelands"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_34_desc:0 "Oxford, a town in southern England. Once, there was a small river here, so shallow it could be forded by ox-cart, which gave the place its name. Today, that river has vanished for various reasons, but what has grown in its stead are the great local pasturelands and the herdsmen toiling upon them."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_35_title:0 "Sussex Farmlands"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_35_desc:0 "Centuries ago, when the Saxons from the Germanic lands sailed their ships to the shores of Britain, they named this place Sussex. Once the site of a small kingdom, many of its castles have now been dismantled, replaced by fertile farmland. The grain from here is shipped across the nation, providing a massive supply of food."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_36_title:0 "Reclaiming Ireland"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_36_desc:0 "Ireland lies on the western frontier of the British Isles. Its people lived a traditional life unchanged for millennia, but now that life has been disrupted. Modern, large-scale farms have been established, and intensive farming methods are being widely adopted across the land. Without a doubt, we are gradually making Ireland flourish."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_37_title:0 "York's Economy"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_37_desc:0 "In the year 866 AD, a band of Vikings invaded England and named the territory they seized Jórvík, or York. In today's York, we no longer see Vikings, but we can hear the roar of boilers and the clang of the smithy. York has become a gathering place for workshops of all kinds. Goods from across the nation are brought here, processed, and then sold throughout the land."

EDG_BTA_mission_1_38_title:0 "Reviving Wessex"
EDG_BTA_mission_1_38_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Wessex was once the unifier of the English lands, yet centuries later, we seem to have forgotten this cradle of our dragon. The region's unique geographical advantages have shown us that we can rely on this place to perfect our national industry. We can accelerate local development by leveraging Wessex's specific geographical conditions."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_11_title:0 "Explore the Seas"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_11_desc:0 "Iberian navigators have returned from the west with endless goods and exotic wares from the natives. We cannot allow such vast riches to lie untapped; there too should be a place for the Scots. Sail westward, explorers, for there lies boundless glory awaiting you."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_12_title:0 "Caribbean Haven"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_12_desc:0 "Trade in the Caribbean Sea has flourished as European colonial ventures expand. If we can establish our own outpost in the Caribbean islands, we can not only better pursue trade, but also, when necessary, 'acquire' a share of trade from others' hands."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_13_title:0 "West Indies"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_13_desc:0 "As our colonization of the West Indies deepens, our trade in the Americas becomes more convenient. Furthermore, the West Indies are naturally suited for growing crops like tobacco and sugarcane, providing solid support for our triangular trade. Each small island is like a gold mine, unearthed by us one by one."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_14_title:0 "Invasion of Navarat"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_14_desc:0 "The western shore of the Gulf of Mexico hosts a wealthy civilization—they call themselves the Aztecs. We care not for Aztec traditions, beliefs, or aspirations; we only know our own pursuit—there is gold there. As our colonial enterprise advances, shiploads of gold and tropical produce are sent to Europe."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_15_title:0 "Viceroyalty of Mexico"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_15_desc:0 "To attract settlers to the New World, we initially relaxed restrictions. This led to severe administrative chaos, which perhaps mattered little at first but is now an unavoidable issue. As our colonial reach in Mexico expands, efficient and unified governance in Mexico has become necessary."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_17_title:0 "New World Hegemony"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_17_desc:0 "Having established colonial rule over the New World from north to south, we have effectively achieved hegemony over its trade. African slaves are sent to the New World, while shiploads of plantation crops and precious metals return to Europe. A vast trade network has been established, bringing prosperity to our nation from the New World."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_18_title:0 "Discover Guinea"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_18_desc:0 "Once, the turbulent currents off West Africa hindered our eastward exploration. Now, with advances in navigation, we have finally breached these treacherous seas. When we reached the dense woodlands south of the great desert of Berber legend, we knew our efforts were not in vain."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_19_title:0 "Cape of Good Hope"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_19_desc:0 "'I tell you true, we were nearly at our end and had to turn back—our provisions were running out,' the aged captain recounted the tale of his youth with undimmed vigor. 'That night, as I prepared to give the order to return, I suddenly saw a great cape appear on the horizon, stretching eastwards and then north. Truly, it was the happiest moment of my life.'"

EDG_BTA_mission_2_20_title:0 "Oceanic Trade"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_20_desc:0 "Setting sail from the west of Europe, rounding the West African coast, sailing southward past the Cape of Good Hope, then north to India or south to the Spice Islands, Japan, and China. A vast trade route has been established, continuously funneling Eastern goods into the West and filling the purses of our people."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_21_title:0 "King Solomon"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_21_desc:0 "The imperial court of Ethiopia claims descent from King Solomon, and for generations has guarded the treasure of the Ark of the Covenant in secret. Now, with the gradual establishment of our trade posts around the Gulf of Aden, we may find a way to uncover the Ark's location. This would undoubtedly be a great surprise for the Catholic world."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_22_title:0 "The Southern Continent"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_22_desc:0 "The theory that 'a continent must exist in the world's south' was first proposed by Aristotle in ancient Greece. Everyone believed it to be mere fancy, the idle speculation of a long-gone sage. Yet, with our own actions, we have proven that the southern continent truly exists."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_23_title:0 "Pacific Foothold"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_23_desc:0 "Many years have passed since we discovered Indonesia and Australia, where we have since built vast colonies. Beyond bringing immense trade revenue, our colonial ventures in Indonesia and Australia have secured our firm grip on the western shores of the Pacific."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_26_title:0 "Unshackle the Printing Press" # Unshackle the Printing Industry
EDG_BTA_mission_2_26_desc:0 "The printing industry has long served as the state's mouthpiece, producing extensive propaganda for the machinery of government. In the past, our restrictions on the industry have been too tight. We should inject fresh vitality into printing, allowing it to operate more efficiently and ultimately bring new vigor and dynamism to the people."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_27_title:0 "University of Oxford"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_27_desc:0 "Records of formal instruction in Oxford date back to the 11th century. Since 1176, Oxford has officially been established as our nation's first university. Over the centuries, the University of Oxford has become the center of our educational sector. By developing Oxford, we have cultivated a vast number of talents."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_29_title:0 "University of Cambridge"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_29_desc:0 "The University of Cambridge originated from violent conflicts in the early 13th century between scholars from Oxford and local residents of Oxfordshire. Subsequently, a large number of teachers and students relocated to Cambridgeshire, where the new university gradually took shape. After over two centuries of development, the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford stand as twin jewels in our nation's educational crown, illuminating the path for scholars across Britain."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_30_title:0 "Education Movement"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_30_desc:0 "As our nation's economy achieves significant progress, an educational modernization project known as the 'Education Movement' is also in full swing, receiving strong support from our Parliament. It is believed that before long, our country will be built into a modern educational powerhouse."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_31_title:0 "Modern Education" # Modern Education System
EDG_BTA_mission_2_31_desc:0 "Our nation's education system was born from chance—first from the whims of Henry II which led to Oxford, and then from an accidental armed conflict which led to Cambridge. However, today we have turned it into an inevitability. Europe's, and indeed the world's, first modern education system has been established. Our nation's education leads the world."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_33_title:0 "British Handicrafts"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_33_desc:0 "Traditional British handicrafts are often fragmented. To guide the development of our handicraft sector and improve its standards, we need to implement industrial reforms. We should standardize industry management, enact laws, and focus on developing the handicraft industry to lay the foundation for our nation's modernization."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_34_title:0 "Woolen & Cotton Exports"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_34_desc:0 "Britain's temperate maritime climate and flat terrain are highly suitable for cotton cultivation. Large quantities of cotton are produced and used for various purposes. We should increase cotton production and vigorously support our cotton industry, for both domestic use and foreign trade."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_35_title:0 "Canterbury Woolens"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_35_desc:0 "Britain's woolen production is vast, and among it, the woolens from Canterbury are the most remarkable. Canterbury wool is loose yet resilient, suitable for a variety of products. We should encourage cotton production in the Canterbury region and establish corresponding industrial facilities."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_36_title:0 "East Anglia Industry"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_36_desc:0 "Following the further development of the Enclosure Movement, the so-called 'Agricultural Revolution' first occurred in East Anglia. Agricultural efficiency has improved significantly. Coupled with East Anglia's extensive inland waterway transport network, an effective transportation hub has been established, and industrialization is beginning to emerge in East Anglia."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_37_title:0 "East Midlands Development"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_37_desc:0 "The East Midlands region is close to the cradle of our regime, Scotland, and its location in eastern England allows it to effectively connect north-south transportation. We have established an extensive road network in the East Midlands. By linking various regions, this network can generate significant industrial value and produce a radiating effect."

EDG_BTA_mission_2_38_title:0 "Developing Wales"
EDG_BTA_mission_2_38_desc:0 "The region of Wales was long regarded as a remote backwater, a wilderness of mountains and wilds. Its rugged terrain made economic development difficult and life arduous for its people. Now, our modernizing reforms are about to reach this once-barren land, bringing much-needed relief to the local populace."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_12_title:0 "South America"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_12_desc:0 "The discovery of South America has brought us boundless wealth. Though it is a land of dense rainforests, crawling serpents, and miasmic airs, it also holds untold treasures. Bananas, coffee, and sugarcane all find suitable land for cultivation here. Moreover, here lies the gold we have long dreamed of. This will be the best of times."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_13_title:0 "Viceroy of Colombia"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_13_desc:0 "Our Colombian colony has grown from a few small outposts into a vast territory. Now, the Viceroyalty of Colombia has become a model colony for our nation. Here, the various products needed by our European homeland are produced day and night. Merchant ships unload goods here and return laden to the other shore; everything is thriving."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_15_title:0 "Brazilian Plantations"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_15_desc:0 "When the Portuguese first discovered this land, they named this vast territory 'Brazil' after the 'pau-brasil' (brazilwood) that grew in abundance. However, beyond brazilwood, Brazil is also a great treasury. A multitude of plantation crops can thrive here, bringing us economic benefit."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_16_title:0 "Port of Buenos Aires"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_16_desc:0 "When Spanish explorers first sailed to these shores, the skies were clear and cloudless, leading them to name this land 'Good Airs' or 'Buenos Aires'. Centuries later, it has grown into a vast trading port, connecting the Río de la Plata colonies with the outside world. Here, all is prosperous."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_19_title:0 "West India Company"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_19_desc:0 "The western coast of India should be our first foothold for opening trade with Asia, as from here we can influence the Asian economy. We must establish a West India Company to better guide trade operations between our western Indian outposts and the local population, and seek further trade penetration in the region."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_21_title:0 "Invasion of Gujarat"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_21_desc:0 "As the West India Company gradually establishes its presence on India's western coast, we should prepare for our first expansion in India. Using frictions generated by the Company's activities with locals as a pretext, we can implement 'trade protection' in the region, and Gujarat is a most suitable target."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_22_title:0 "Controlling the Sikhs"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_22_desc:0 "In the northwestern reaches of India resides a people of peculiar faith who call themselves Sikhs. We have no interest in, nor concern for, their beliefs, but their location sits squarely on the vital transit routes to Central Asia. To better control Central Asia, it is time we turned our attention to them."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_24_title:0 "Where the Sun Never Sets" # The Empire on Which the Sun Never Sets
EDG_BTA_mission_3_24_desc:0 "From California on the eastern shores of the Pacific to Burma east of India, the sun never sets on Britain. Our colonies span the globe, and our trade ships sail every ocean of the Earth. This is our era, the era of the Britons."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_26_title:0 "Bail Act"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_26_desc:0 "As early as ancient Rome, the Twelve Tables stipulated that one could be guaranteed by a surety to avoid a plaintiff's summons. The bail system can fully protect people's right to liberty, greatly conserve social resources, and improve our nation's efficiency. We should implement a bail system."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_28_title:0 "Establish a High Court"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_28_desc:0 "For far too long, some nobles have lacked reverence for the law, acting with impunity and causing widespread grievance among the people. By establishing a High Court, we can effectively curb the nobility's tendency to tyrannize locally and disregard royal authority. We will administer justice impartially and uphold equality before the law."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_29_title:0 "The Game of Thrones"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_29_desc:0 "'The King's behavior has become truly intolerable lately—a full forty thousand pounds! We drew forty thousand pounds from the treasury, just to bury his wife!' 'Ah, but what can we do? We are all but His Majesty's subjects.' 'I tell you, as long as old William remains in the Prime Minister's seat, he shall not succeed!'"

EDG_BTA_mission_3_31_title:0 "God's Plenipotentiary" # God's Plenipotentiary on Earth
EDG_BTA_mission_3_31_desc:0 "The royal prerogative of the English King has expanded dramatically over the past century. The King brazenly levies taxes on nobles and entrepreneurs to fund his vanity projects and, under various pretexts, solicits donations and sells titles. As Britain grows increasingly chaotic, more and more people are beginning to question the King's position."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_32_title:0 "The Bill of Rights"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_32_desc:0 "The Bill of Rights, formally titled 'An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown,' explicitly delineates the powers of the monarch, significantly curbing royal authority and truly establishing the principle of parliamentary supremacy over the Crown. It has paved the way for our nation's economic development."

EDG_BTA_mission_3_35_title:0 "Iron and Steel Industry"
EDG_BTA_mission_3_35_desc:0 "Iron and steel form a crucial link in the lifeline of the national economy.

EDG_BTA_mission_4_19_title:0 "Laying Hands on Coromandel"
EDG_BTA_mission_4_19_desc:0 "We must also establish a permanent foothold on the eastern coast of India. The Coromandel Coast is an excellent target.
