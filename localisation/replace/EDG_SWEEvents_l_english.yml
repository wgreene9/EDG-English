EDG_SWEEvents.0.name:0 "Kingdom of Sweden"
EDG_SWEEvents.0.desc:0 "At its inception, the Kingdom of Sweden was a loose realm composed of highly autonomous provinces, each governed by its own laws. The king was responsible for coordinating between the provinces and organizing foreign wars. By the 12th century, royal authority had grown considerably, with unified taxation and laws established across the nation. However, power remained constrained by the three-estates parliament, composed of the nobility and landowners.\n\nIn 1397, to counter the powerful Hanseatic League's influence in the North and Baltic Seas, representatives from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden gathered in the coastal city of Kalmar in southeastern Sweden to formally establish the 'Kalmar Union.' The delegates swore allegiance to Margaret and crowned the 16-year-old Eric as monarch of the tripartite union. From then on, Sweden and Norway submitted to the rule of the Danish king. While retaining their status as kingdoms, the three-estates parliament still controlled most domestic affairs in Sweden.\n\nConflicts between Sweden and Denmark arose frequently during the Kalmar Union period, pushing the already unstable personal union toward disintegration. In 1434, Swedish peasants and miners revolted, followed by sporadic uprisings. Local nobles employed various methods to weaken royal power, prompting King Eric to seek support from the burgher class. He repeatedly allied with the burghers to attack the nobility, hoping to maintain his power and preserve the personal union. However, this sowed the seeds for the Danish monarchy's downfall.\n\nWhen the Danish nobility opposed Eric's designated successor, the king took a hardline stance, eventually triggering a civil war. Swedish regent Charles VIII thereby gained full control of Sweden's governance, effectively freeing Sweden and Norway from the Kalmar Union. Moreover, due to Eric's treachery during his suppression of the domestic nobility, Sweden 'unexpectedly' acquired the region of Skåne and entrusted its administration to the Griffin family.\n\nWith the fall of the Kingdom of Denmark in the burgher uprising of 1439, the Kalmar Union completely dissolved. Sweden had now emerged as one of the most powerful nations in Northern Europe. Charles VIII's primary task was to manage the legacy of the Kalmar Union and consolidate his own position—to be formally crowned King of Sweden."

EDG_SWEEvents.3.name:0 "Gustav Eriksson Vasa"
EDG_SWEEvents.3.desc:0 "Gustav Eriksson Vasa is a young noble from the House of Vasa, whose lineage can be traced back to the 14th century. The earliest recorded family member is Nils Kettilsson, who served as castellan of the Three Crowns Castle in 1355. The name 'Vasa' first appeared at the end of the 16th century, derived from the family coat of arms—a Vase (sheaf)—and has since become renowned throughout Sweden.\n\nEven in his youth, Gustav Vasa inherited a staggering amount of land and wealth. With such a background, it was inevitable that he would not be content with the status quo. Over a few years, he managed to secure the support of most members of the provincial assemblies and several major Swedish nobles, aiming to ascend to the Swedish throne."

EDG_SWEEvents.4.name:0 "Centralization Reforms"
EDG_SWEEvents.4.desc:0 "Gustav Vasa devoted his life to centralization, seeking to reclaim power from various estates and assemblies and concentrate it in the hands of the king. Consequently, he suppressed other domestic classes, particularly the major nobles. Simultaneously, Gustav Vasa addressed the Pope's influence in Sweden by appointing Lutheran clergy in 1527 to carry out religious reforms, confiscating church lands and castles, disbanding church armies, and significantly weakening papal constraints on royal authority.\n\nThe consequences of the centralization campaign were also evident, as dissenters within the country continuously launched rebellions. Major nobles repeatedly challenged Gustav Vasa's authority and attempted to overthrow the government, while several large-scale popular uprisings occurred in Dalarna and other regions. The church also constantly caused trouble during this period. All these rebellions were brutally suppressed by Gustav Vasa. First, in 1540, almost all bishops except the Petri brothers and the Archbishop he appointed were executed. Then, in 1542, the leader of an uprising, Nils Dacke, was drawn and quartered.\n\nDuring the centralization movement, Gustav Vasa maintained national stability and consolidated the position of royal authority through iron-fisted measures. By the time of his death, two-thirds of the nation's land was directly under the Crown, and he amassed immense wealth from commercial activities, making him one of Europe's wealthiest monarchs. Although internal strife after his death led to a series of problems, the reforms he implemented during his reign remained a significant factor in Sweden's subsequent rise."

EDG_SWEEvents.5.desc:0 "During his reign, to implement centralization and reduce the influence of the Catholic Church in Sweden, Gustav Vasa deposed the then Catholic Archbishop of Sweden, Gustav Trolle. He then wrote to Pope Clement VII, demanding the Pope accept his nominated candidate for the new Archbishop, Johannes Magnus, who was completely obedient to the king.\n\nThe Pope naturally refused his demand and ordered the immediate reinstatement of Trolle as Archbishop, which was clearly unacceptable to Gustav I. With the Pope's uncompromising stance on Trolle's ecclesiastical position, Gustav Vasa finally took matters into his own hands in 1531 and decided on the Archbishop candidate himself, completely stripping the Pope of his influence over the Swedish church.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Lutheran-led Reformation began, its doctrines spread widely. In the 1520s, Swedish Lutheran scholars, the Petri brothers, propagated Lutheran teachings in Sweden and were welcomed by Gustav Vasa. Lutheranism thus spread extensively throughout Sweden.\n\nIn 1523, Gustav Vasa ordered the Bible to be translated into Swedish, and it was published in 1526. The complete Swedish Bible translation was published in 1541, commonly known as the 'Gustav Vasa Bible.' This translation was highly successful and was continuously reprinted thereafter, remaining the most widely used Bible translation until 1917.\n\nThe Vasa Bible is generally considered a moderate synthesis of Old Swedish and New Swedish. It did not entirely use the contemporary spoken language nor completely abandon archaic terminology, playing a tremendous role in promoting the development and standardization of the Swedish language."

EDG_SWEEvents.6.desc:0 "Gustav Adolf received an excellent education and strict training from a young age as the heir to the throne. His private tutor, Johan Skytte, was a widely learned man who had traveled extensively. He imparted knowledge in various fields to Gustav, making his intellect surpass that of most young men of his time. Gustav's formal curriculum focused on Latin and theology, but he also held a strong interest in rhetoric, debate, mathematics, geometry, political science, history, and literature. He could speak Dutch, Latin, German, and Italian fluently, and later learned some English, Spanish, Polish, and Russian. He was well-versed in European classical works and studied military science with particular diligence.\n\nFrom childhood, Gustav accompanied his father on travels, even attending council meetings, participating in political and military activities. At the age of 13, Gustav read the coronation oath on his father's behalf at Uppsala Cathedral. At 15, he was responsible for managing the ducal territory in Västmanland, gaining experience in administration and finance. He also frequently held talks with foreign envoys, acquiring practical experience as a ruler.\n\nAfter the emperor's death, as the eldest son, he ascended to the throne at the young age of 17, while Sweden faced internal and external crises.

Moreover, their militaristic policies and exploitation of the people stirred strong discontent among all social classes. More troubling was that Gustav Adolf was still young at his succession and, according to Swedish custom, could not rule directly. This allowed some major nobles to seize the opportunity to demand political participation, thereby intensifying the political crisis.\n\nTo stabilize the situation and overcome internal and external troubles, Gustav attempted to make various concessions to the major nobles. In his coronation oath, he pledged: not to enact laws, declare war, make peace, form alliances with other countries, levy extra taxes, or conscript troops without the consent of his ministers and the estates. Simultaneously, he granted large tracts of land to nobles who had distinguished themselves in war and appointed them to important positions.\n\nSubsequently, Gustav appointed Count Axel Oxenstierna, a representative of the nobility, as the chief minister of the government. This series of concessions alleviated the dissatisfaction of the major nobles, turning their support toward the king."

EDG_SWEEvents.9.name:0 "Swedish Military Reforms (Part I)"
EDG_SWEEvents.9.desc:0 "After a series of wars, Gustav Adolf carried out sweeping reforms to the military system.\n\nGustav Adolf's military reforms did not merely copy the then-prevalent Spanish military system. Instead, he implemented a series of groundbreaking changes in military affairs, such as recruitment system reform, weaponry and equipment reform, military structural reform, training methods and tactical doctrine reform, military technology, and logistical support system reform.\n\nFirst, he abolished the mercenary system and implemented a conscription system. His decree mandated that all men aged 15 to 40 in the nation were obligated to serve in the military. Those refusing service could pay a substantial exemption fee instead. On this basis, he established a standing army of 36,000 men, primarily composed of peasants, and subjected this force to strict training and discipline. In his view, for an army to be victorious, it must possess mobility, which is based on discipline, and discipline is founded on effective administration and leadership. After such reorganization, the combat effectiveness of the Swedish army greatly improved.\n\nCompared to traditional tactics, Gustav Adolf placed greater emphasis on active offense and mobility. He believed that relying solely on the firepower available at the time could not secure victory; there was a need for assault capabilities for close combat, a role only cavalry could fulfill, thus increasing investment in cavalry. Simultaneously, he broke from the old patterns of military supply, establishing an efficient logistical support system centered on fixed supply depots and staging posts. This not only ensured army supplies but also reduced baggage trains, significantly enhancing the mobility of the troops."

EDG_SWEEvents.10.name:0 "Swedish Military Reforms (Part II)"
EDG_SWEEvents.10.desc:0 "Gustav Adolf abandoned the then-popular Spanish Tercio tactics, diligently studying and researching historical warfare experiences, particularly those of his adversaries. Through continuous refinement and innovation, he pioneered the wedge formation, the precursor to linear tactics.\n\nThis tactical formation had a depth of three ranks, with pikemen arranged in a 3 to 6-rank line, flanked by musketeers on both sides. The entire army adopted a linear formation, a development made possible by the improved accuracy and rate of fire of muskets at the time. Elongating the line significantly increased the density of volleys and posed a flanking fire threat to the enemy. This formation transformed the traditional cumbersome squares, enabling infantry, cavalry, and artillery to cooperate and fight in concert. Each branch could also flexibly adjust according to changing circumstances. This was Gustav Adolf's unique tactical innovation and a milestone in military history, marking the transition from ancient and medieval tactics to modern tactics.\n\nGustav Adolf also established an armaments industry, mass-producing firearms, cannons, and ammunition. He made technical improvements to muskets and artillery, enhancing their rate of fire and firepower. He shifted more infantry from pikemen to musketeer formations, increasing the overall firepower and flexibility of infantry squares. By restructuring army organization into smaller units, he enhanced the mobility of the troops.\n\nFurthermore, he strongly emphasized the significance of artillery in warfare. He reduced the weight of cannons to increase their mobility in the field, established specialized artillery units, trained professional artillery troops, and made improvements in cannon types, firing rates, and reloading. He also integrated light cannons into infantry lines to boost firepower output. Under Gustav's command, artillery evolved from a marginalized auxiliary branch into an independent and core military arm."

EDG_SWEEvents.12.name:0 "Swedish Political Reforms"
EDG_SWEEvents.12.desc:0 "During the reign of Gustav Adolf, with the assistance of Count Axel Oxenstierna, political reform policies were gradually implemented.\n\nFirst, Gustav Adolf took measures to reorganize and strengthen administrative institutions at all levels, dividing the nation into several provinces to replace the medieval counties controlled by local magnates. The king directly appointed governors and other key officials. Each province established relatively sound administrative and financial management bodies. These reforms strengthened central control over local areas, secured treasury revenues, and combated residual feudal lordship.\n\nStarting in 1614, under the royal court, the Treasury, the Army Department, and the Navy Department were successively established, and Sweden's first Court of Appeal, 'Svea Hovrätt,' was created as a higher entity than the ancient district courts ('tingsrätt'). Foreign affairs and state archives were also managed by specialized agencies. Officials for all these departments were appointed by the king and answered to him, further strengthening centralization.\n\nGustav also clearly defined the scope of authority for each department, improving the efficiency of the central government. In 1617, Gustav enacted the Riksdag Ordinance, stipulating the number and authority of representatives from each estate in the assembly, granting the Riksdag a degree of independence and responsibility for supervising state financial revenues and expenditures. Simultaneously, the status of the Council of the Realm was elevated. The king would personally attend Council meetings, carefully listen to various opinions, and after making decisions, submit them to the Riksdag for approval. However, in practice, Gustav, with his profound knowledge and eloquent oratory, always managed to sway both the Council and the Riksdag to follow his will.\n\nThese reforms adjusted the relationship between the king and the nobility as well as other social classes, expanded the social base of Swedish feudal rule, and enhanced the prestige of the monarchy."

EDG_SWEEvents.13.name:0 "Swedish Economic Reforms"
EDG_SWEEvents.13.desc:0 "In economic terms, Gustav II vigorously advocated and encouraged the development of mining and metallurgical industries and protected peasant self-governance.\n\nSweden's high-latitude location meant its population, arable land, and total economic output were limited. Therefore, it was necessary to fully tap into the power of the common people. Through decrees, peasant self-governance was adequately protected, preventing excessive exploitation and oppression by the nobility, thereby preserving sufficient vital strength for the kingdom.\n\nIn industry, due to the active introduction of advanced technology and equipment updates, production efficiency greatly improved. At that time, Sweden's annual copper output reached 2000-3000 tons, making it Europe's largest copper exporter. The metalworking industry also flourished by hiring Dutch technicians to guide production and widely adopting advanced technologies from other European countries. In the early 17th century, numerous prosperous industrial cities emerged in Sweden. Gustav introduced preferential policies to attract talent, cultivating a group of excellent domestic technicians. Taking the city of Falun as an example, it had 5,000 artisans engaged in various professions. The development of industry not only significantly improved Sweden's financial situation but also boosted the nation's arms production.\n\nIndustrial development simultaneously brought prosperity to foreign trade. Gustav II allocated funds to establish the 'Southern Company' to manage foreign trade. Swedish copper, iron, timber, and tar were not only best-sellers in European markets but also exported to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, earning the country substantial foreign exchange. This accelerated the growth of national economic strength and laid an economic foundation for Sweden's foreign wars."

However, with the unification of the Rus' principalities in the East, Sweden has had to face its longstanding rival.
