h07_weimar_republic_government:0 "Second Weimar Republic"
h07_weimar_republic_government_desc:0 "After enduring the rule of the First Republic, first by Czech nobility and then by local oligarchs, the people of Weimar came to deeply understand the flaws of a republican system dependent on the Holy Roman Empire's feudal hierarchy and nepotism. Now, guided by the Bible, the people of Weimar have implemented a series of reforms to the republican system. Though the Second Republic still has many shortcomings, it remains a step towards the ideal."

h07_weimar_deutschlande_government:0 "Weimar Constitution"
h07_weimar_deutschlande_government_desc:0 "Germany, Germany above all. However, the Germany founded by the Weimar Republic faces numerous issues, the most severe likely being the excessive latitude granted to presidential power, which makes the nascent German Republic highly susceptible to falling into the hands of a dictator. But that is a concern for the future..."

h07_weimar_nationale_councila:0 "Republican National Council"
h07_weimar_nationale_councila_desc:0 "As the nation's highest governmental body, the Republican National Council is primarily responsible for domestic administrative decisions and legislation. Representatives of citizens, peasants, and merchants from each province obtain seats in the council based on provincial population ratios, ensuring, as far as possible, that the interests of the majority are upheld without outright ignoring minority voices. Additionally, thanks to the Republic's governance traditions, the National Council manages transitions between war and peace effectively."

h07_weimar_black_templars:0 "Templar Army"
h07_weimar_black_templars_desc:0 "Following guidance from the Bible, the Republic finally possesses its own formal army. Unlike traditional European military structures, the Templar Army's organization leans more towards that of a crusading knightly order. In peacetime, soldiers generally engage in agricultural production or urban activities. Once war breaks out, soldiers can mobilize rapidly, and bolstered by faith, the Templar Army exhibits remarkable morale recovery rates."

h07_weimar_religous_affairs:0 "Thy Will Be Done on Earth"
h07_weimar_religous_affairs_desc:0 "Although the Bible holds a special place in the Republic, prolonged interaction with various forms of 'heresy' has led the people to focus more on commonalities in doctrine rather than rigid dogmatism. Service itself is its own reward."

h07_weimar_german_commenweath:0 "Federal State System"
h07_weimar_german_commenweath_desc:0 "The Weimar Republic's local politics consist of various federal states. These states possess considerable autonomy and traditional freedoms, maximizing administrative efficiency in exchange for respect for local governance."

h07_weimar_party_politik:0 "Early Political Party System"
h07_weimar_party_politik_desc:0 "Within central and local administrative bodies, different interest factions form various political interest groups. The Republic's overall governance also heavily relies on these early party-style interest groups."

h07_weimar_president_parliamenta:0 "Semi-Presidential System (Parliamentary Republic)"
h07_weimar_president_parliamenta_desc:0 "Since Weimar's republican system is a hybrid product of multiple political systems and interest groups, the Republic's council requires a leader to ensure necessary unity, even if this might push the leader's position towards the abyss of dictatorship."
