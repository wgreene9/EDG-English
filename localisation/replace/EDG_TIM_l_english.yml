He was born in Sayram, Isfijab, on the Central Asian steppe. His father, Ibrahim, is said to have been a descendant of Caliph Ali. He is considered one of the earliest Turkic poets, composing his Diwan-i Hikmet (Book of Wisdom) in Middle Turkic, establishing principles of asceticism and humble devotion. He was also a pioneer of mysticism, founding the first Turkic Sufi order—the Yasawiyya. By preaching in the Turkic language and reconciling Islam with traditional Turkic culture, he facilitated the widespread adoption of Islam among Turkic-speaking peoples. After his death, his disciples organized into orders (tariqas) to continue spreading his teachings. The mausoleum built for him by Timur became a holy site for the Turkic people. The subjects of [Root.GetName] hope that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will, like their ancestors, follow Yasawi's teachings and embrace Islam."

EDG_TIM_events.0.t:0 "Undercurrents"
EDG_TIM_events.0.d:0 "Timur the Lame, the fearsome conqueror who rose from the Western Chagatai Khanate, undefeated and unstoppable, established the great Gurkani Empire. Although the empire fractured and crumbled due to a betrayal by Nestorian Christians in Khorasan during Timur's campaign against the Ottomans, it managed to maintain its rule in Transoxiana. Timur had designated two heirs, both of whom unfortunately predeceased him. The new heir appointed by Timur on his deathbed, Pir Muhammad, lacked the prestige to hold the empire together. A brutal civil war erupted among Timur's descendants vying for the throne, ultimately won by Pir Muhammad's uncle, Shah Rukh, who defeated the other claimants and entered Samarkand.\n\nShah Rukh has now ruled the Gurkani for nearly forty years. Unlike his father Timur, Shah Rukh focused more on civil governance, resembling a humble Islamic Sultan more than a Turco-Mongol conqueror. Shah Rukh married Gawhar Shad, the daughter of a Persian noble, who long assisted her husband in managing the state. During Shah Rukh's reign, Transoxiana enjoyed prolonged peace and prosperity. Culture and the arts flourished under his generous patronage, and Samarkand became a world center of science and arts, rivaling Florence, while Islamic civilization experienced a renaissance and re-entered a golden age in the region.\n\nHowever, beneath this prosperity, undercurrents are stirring. Shah Rukh's arrogant grandson, Sultan Muhammad, serving as governor of Khorasan, launched a rebellion in Mashhad. The nearly 70-year-old Shah Rukh personally led an expedition to suppress it but was injured during the march and had to return to Samarkand. Sultan Muhammad was killed not long after by the Sarbadars. Since returning injured to Samarkand, Shah Rukh's health has steadily deteriorated, and everyone senses his time is near, yet the succession remains unresolved. Ulugh Beg is the designated legitimate heir, but the Queen, Gawhar Shad, has always favored her own grandson, Ala al-Dawla. Meanwhile, Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbek has united the steppe tribes to the north and is poised to march south, awaiting only the right moment. All hold their breath in anticipation..."
EDG_TIM_events.0.a:0 "§RThe fate of the Sultan determines the rise and fall of the nation!§!"

EDG_TIM_events.1.t:0 "The Death of Shah Rukh"
EDG_TIM_events.1.d:0 "The old Sultan, Shah Rukh, has passed away peacefully in his sleep. Ulugh Beg, who has been governing Hisar, is Shah Rukh's eldest son and thus the rightful heir. Upon receiving news of his father's death, Ulugh Beg is hastening back from Hisar to Samarkand to be crowned as the new Sultan. However, not everyone wishes to see Ulugh Beg's smooth succession. Ala al-Dawla, the eldest son of Baysunghur, is the beloved grandson of the Dowager Empress Gawhar Shad. Immediately after Shah Rukh's death, Gawhar Shad sent messengers to inform Ala al-Dawla, who governs Fergana. Ulugh Beg's eldest son, Abd al-Latif, discovering this, suspected the Dowager Empress of intending to bypass his father and install Ala al-Dawla as the new Sultan. He therefore imprisoned the Empress and prepared to raise an army against Ala al-Dawla. Ala al-Dawla himself had already conspired and previously made a secret pact with Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbeks. Learning of the turmoil in Samarkand, he outright launched a rebellion, while Abu'l-Khayr Khan has also mobilized a great army to invade Transoxiana from the north, intervening in the Timurid succession crisis. Ala al-Dawla's act of inviting the wolf into the fold will ultimately backfire. If Ala al-Dawla is installed as the new Sultan, lacking legitimate foundations for his rule, he will inevitably become even more dependent on northern protection to maintain power, eventually becoming a puppet of the Uzbeks in Samarkand. Abu'l-Khayr Khan, with his predatory gaze, is no benign figure and will certainly not miss such an opportunity. The fate of the dynasty may hinge on this very conflict."

However, Ulugh Beg's rule was not precarious. Under Ulugh Beg's leadership, [Root.GetName] mounted an effective resistance against the Uzbek invasion. Although Abu'l-Khayr Khan achieved some gains in the early stages of the war against [Root.GetName], he soon found himself mired in a quagmire. The war's failures fueled growing discontent among the tribes towards [SHY.Monarch.GetName], forcing [SHY.Monarch.GetName] to choose retreat. The once-overweening Abu'l-Khayr Khan's path of conquest ultimately foundered at the gates of [TIM.GetName]. After repelling the Uzbek invasion, [Root.Monarch.GetName] captured Ala al-Dawla alive, severed his limbs, and cast him into the wilderness to be devoured by wolves. Through this victory, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] successfully established his authority and consolidated his rule.

But now it seems the Khan's momentary impulse has plunged the Ulus into a quagmire. Ulugh Beg's rule was not precarious; on the contrary, our unpopular puppet Ala al-Dawla provoked opposition from all factions within Timur's realm. United by shared interests, they resisted the invasion, causing our offensive to progress painfully slowly. Although Khan [Root.Monarch.GetName] was confident of eventually crushing Ulugh Beg, the tribes grew deeply dissatisfied, with some tribal leaders even beginning to challenge the Khan's authority.

EDG_TIM_events.6.d:0 "Ulugh Beg is Shah Rukh's eldest son and his designated heir. A prodigious literary scholar, mathematician, and astronomer who achieved great scientific accomplishments, Ulugh Beg shows little interest in politics, leading many to believe Shah Rukh's third son, Baysunghur, was more suited to be Sultan. Baysunghur excelled in statecraft and enjoyed high prestige among the nobility but died young at 36. His three sons, Ala al-Dawla, Sultan Muhammad, and Abul-Qasim Babur, inherited their father's status, serving as governors to assist Shah Rukh in ruling. Ala al-Dawla governs Fergana, Sultan Muhammad governed Khorasan, and Abul-Qasim Babur governs Khwarezm. However, Sultan Muhammad rebelled in Khorasan and was later killed by the Sarbadars. To train his politically disinterested heir, Shah Rukh sent Ulugh Beg to Hisar to resist the rising Kartid dynasty in Afghanistan. Ulugh Beg is the designated successor of Sultan Shah Rukh, but now the Sultan lies on his deathbed. The Queen, Gawhar Shad, controls the court and favors Ala al-Dawla, her beloved grandson, intending to help him seize the throne. Ala al-Dawla himself has long conspired, forming a secret pact and alliance with Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbeks, plotting treachery. His brother Babur watches coldly from Khwarezm, waiting for his moment.

We plan to exploit the discord between Babur and his brother to persuade him to side with Ulugh Beg, but the ambitious Babur will not agree easily.

He was Ulugh Beg's most accomplished student and later succeeded Jamshid al-Kashi as the director of the Ulugh Beg Observatory. In his astronomical work, 'On the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy on Philosophy,' he opposed Aristotelian interventions in physics, refuted Aristotle's notions of a stationary Earth and uniform circular motion of celestial bodies, completely separated natural philosophy from astronomy, and promoted astronomy as a purely empirical and mathematical science. He provided empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation. His textbooks, 'Manual of Arithmetic' and 'Manual of Astronomy,' were also translated into Latin and circulated in Europe."

He would often gaze at the stars alone, marveling at the myriad constellations created by Allah, or tinker with various measuring instruments all day long. Because of this, people often said his younger brother Baysunghur was more suited to be Sultan. Later, he became a mathematician and astronomer. Using his position, he founded the Ulugh Beg Madrasa, gathering the greatest artists and scientists of the Islamic world to exchange ideas on artistic creation and scientific research. He built a magnificent observatory in Samarkand and invited the famous mathematician and astronomer Jamshid al-Kashi to oversee its work. At the observatory, using improved sextants, he observed thousands of celestial bodies. With the assistance of his disciple Ali Qushji, he compiled the astronomical tables known as the Zīj-i Gūrganī (Gurganic Tables), whose recorded data deviated from precise results by only a few seconds. In mathematics, he calculated highly accurate sine and tangent tables, precise to at least eight decimal places. However, the tides of time spare no one. As Sultan Shah Rukh grew old, Ulugh Beg had to gradually set aside his beloved astronomy to shoulder the responsibilities of an heir. To hone his military skills, Shah Rukh sent Ulugh Beg to Hisar to resist the rising Kartid dynasty in Afghanistan. Ulugh Beg had to bid farewell to Samarkand, leaving behind his madrasa and observatory. In Hisar, he lived up to expectations, repeatedly defeating invading Kartid forces at Balkh and Kunduz. Now, the relentless current of history has propelled this astronomer, long considered unfit to lead a nation, to the Sultan's throne. Ulugh Beg returned to the long-absent Samarkand, ascended the observatory, and once again looked up at the stars..."

The Stairway of Heaven explored and solved many problems encountered by predecessors in calculating the sizes and distances of celestial bodies, while the Treatise on Observational Instruments discussed various astronomical instruments. Al-Kashi also invented an analog computing instrument called the 'Plate of Conjunctions' for linear interpolation and calculating the times of planetary conjunctions, and a mechanical planetary calculator called the 'Plate of Zones' to predict the true positions of celestial bodies. In the field of mathematics, al-Kashi authored Risāla al-Muḥīṭīyya (Treatise on the Circumference), Miftāḥ al-Ḥisāb (The Key of Arithmetic), and al-Risāla al-Watar wa'l-Jayb (Treatise on the Chord and Sine). He was the first to explicitly state the law of cosines in a form suitable for triangulation, which became known as 'Kashi's Theorem.'

The Court in Dadu (Beijing) periodically sent envoys to Samarkand demanding tribute from us. Timur repeatedly detained and humiliated Yuan envoys. Later, while planning his eastern campaign against China, Timur again dispatched envoys under the guise of tribute to gather intelligence. Shah Rukh, however, maintained good relations with the Yuan, and exchanges were frequent. During Shah Rukh's reign, Chen Cheng, a vice director from the Yuan Ministry of Personnel, was sent on five missions to Samarkand by imperial command, authoring Records of the Western Regions Journey and Gazetteer of Foreign Lands in the Western Regions. The Sultan also dispatched a tributary embassy led by the diplomat Khwaja Ghiyath al-Din Naqqash to visit various parts of China. Ghiyath al-Din's travelogue was printed and published, becoming an important reference for the historians Hafiz-i Abru and Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi in compiling their chronicles.

After failing to secure the succession against his brother Esen Buqa, he fled to Samarkand with his loyal followers seeking asylum. Ulugh Beg, who had not yet become the governor of Hisar, warmly received Yunus and his men, providing them with provisions on the condition that they first entered the fortress to register their names. However, it was then that the highly learned astronomer revealed a ruthless side. After Yunus and all his men had entered the fortress, Ulugh Beg suddenly ordered the gates closed, turning the fortress into a bloody slaughterhouse. All tribal leaders except Yunus were massacred, and the rest were taken captive. Following this tragedy, Yunus was presented as a prize by Ulugh Beg to his father, Shah Rukh, who received Yunus and sponsored his studies in Iran. For decades thereafter, Yunus traveled and studied across Iran, becoming a student of the historian Sharaf al-Din Ali Yazdi, and eventually settled in Shiraz. Now, the gears of fate turn once more. As chaos intensifies within the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] has summoned Yunus back to Samarkand.

While the relationship between successive Khans and Dughlat chieftains had been relatively harmonious, the current Chagatai Khan, [CHG.Monarch.GetName], and the Dughlat chieftain, Muhammad Haydar Mirza, are locked in irreconcilable conflict. Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] has seized this opportunity of internal strife. He has provided troops to Yunus, whom he earlier recalled to Samarkand, to help him reclaim the Khanate. Yunus led his army back to Kashgar, where he was welcomed by Muhammad Haydar Mirza. The Dughlat tribe proclaimed Yunus the new Eastern Chagatai Khan, challenging [CHG.Monarch.GetName]'s rule.

EDG_TIM_events.86.d:0 "Since the conversion of the Chagatai Khanate to Islam, the process of Islamization began beyond the Jade Gate in the Western Regions. Sufism, in particular, found favor with local emirs. With our conquest of Northwestern China, numerous Sufi orders surged into the region from Bukhara, Urgench, Samarkand, and elsewhere. They merged with existing Islamic sects and, under the influence of local culture, formed the Menhuan system. Menhuans are Sufi religious orders; their leaders are called 'Daozu' or 'Zhenren' and hold supreme status within the order. Menhuans almost exclusively belong to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. The four main Menhuans are: 'Qadiriyya,' 'Kubrawiyya,' 'Khufiyya,' and 'Jahriyya.' Qadiriyya and Kubrawiyya belong to the Qadiri and Kubrawi orders respectively, while both Khufiyya and Jahriyya originated from the Naqshbandi order. Khufiyya, also known as the 'Whispering School,' advocates silent, low-voiced remembrance (dhikr). Jahriyya, or the 'Loud School,' in contrast to the earlier arriving Khufiyya, advocates audible, loud recitation of dhikr.\n\nIn fact, before Sufism's introduction and dominance, a more localized form of Islam had already taken root. This sect is called 'Gedimu' (Qadim), meaning 'ancient,' hence also known as the 'Old Sect.' It entered China as early as the Tang and Song dynasties, making it the oldest Islamic sect in China. Gedimu reveres orthodoxy, devoutly adheres to old rules and traditions, emphasizes minute ritual details, opposes Sufism, and has incorporated numerous Han Chinese elements into religious rites and architecture. However, with the rise of Sufism and Menhuans, Gedimu has gradually declined.\n\nSimultaneously, many Muslim literati in the region, seeking to resist the influence of Central Asian Sufi orders, launched a movement of 'Interpreting the Classics through Confucianism'—the 'Confucian-Islamic Synthesis.' Scholars of this synthesis proposed the idea that 'while elucidating the Heavenly Principles, it truly glorifies our Confucianism.' Using Chinese as their mother tongue, they introduced Confucian concepts and terminology, attempting to construct a system of Chinese Islam.\n\nAfter conquering China, we will inevitably need to utilize more sinicized Islamic sects to govern China's Muslim population. Therefore, we must choose a sect to serve as the dominant ideology for ruling Chinese Muslims."

Gawhar Shad long assisted her husband in governing. Under her influence, Persian language and culture flourished within the realm, becoming a significant cultural element. She patronized many court artists, architects, philosophers, and poets, including Jami, and sponsored the construction of buildings such as the Gawhar Shad Musalla Complex in Herat and the Gawhar Shad Mosque in Mashhad. However, although Gawhar Shad played a crucial role during Shah Rukh's reign, she interfered in state affairs after his death, favoring her beloved grandson Ala al-Dawla in the succession issue, leading to severe chaos. When the succession crisis erupted, Ulugh Beg's son, Abd al-Latif, imprisoned his grandmother Gawhar Shad, and she remains confined. The old Sultan considered releasing her, but as the nation descended into chaos once more, the plan was shelved. Some conspirators began to exploit Gawhar Shad's situation.

string_start_timurids:0 "§O「跛子」帖木儿§!\n如果要问谁是§Y成吉思汗§!之后最令人闻风丧胆的征服者，那必然是§Y「跛子」帖木儿§!。帖木儿自§Y西察合台汗国§!崛起，作为西察合台汗的女婿即「§Y古列干§!」把持朝政，并最终废黜了傀儡汗自立为苏丹。帖木儿一路横扫伊朗，所向披靡，建立了伟大的§Y古列干尼帝国§!。帖木儿大军所到之处，无不血流成河，白骨遍野，伊朗人至今仍无法忘却在帖木儿铁蹄下被支配的恐惧。然而在帖木儿远征§Y奥斯曼§!惩戒傲慢无礼的苏丹§Y「闪电」巴耶济德§!时，§Y呼罗珊§!的§Y景教徒§!趁帝国后方空虚之际发动了起义，各地的伊朗人也纷纷响应，帖木儿大军不得不仓皇撤退。这位伟大的征服者虽然战无不胜，但对新征服的土地却采取了统而不治的态度。经历了伊朗大起义之后，帖木儿在伊朗的统治很快就分崩离析，不得不退回§Y河中§!的统治中心。帖木儿晚年曾集结重兵，谋划东征§Y东察合台汗国§!，借道入主元大都。但这场远征§Y大元帝国§!的宏伟计划很快随着帖木儿的逝世而中断了。\n\n§O沙哈鲁苏丹§!\n帖木儿曾指定过两位继承人，长子§Y贾汗吉尔§!与长孙§Y马黑麻·苏丹§!。不幸的是，这两位继承人都先于帖木儿逝世，帖木儿临终前才指定了孙子§Y皮尔·马黑麻§!作为新的继承人。然而皮尔·马黑麻缺乏威望，在帖木儿死后无法维持对帝国的统治。为了争夺王位，帖木儿的子孙之间爆发了一场惨烈的内战，最终皮尔·马黑麻的四叔§Y沙哈鲁§!击败了其他的觊觎者，入主§Y撒马尔罕§!。沙哈鲁已经统治了古列干尼近四十年，不同于父亲帖木儿，沙哈鲁更注重文治，比起突厥-蒙古征服者，他更像是一位谦逊的伊斯兰苏丹。在他的统治期间，河中迎来长久的和平与繁荣。沙哈鲁娶了波斯贵族的女儿§Y高哈尔绍德§!。高哈尔绍德长期协助丈夫管理国家，在她推动下，波斯语与波斯文化在国内繁荣发展，并成为了重要文化元素之一。\n\n§O兀鲁伯与拜宋豁儿之子§!\n§Y兀鲁伯§!是沙哈鲁的长子，也是沙哈鲁指定的继承人。兀鲁伯还是一位天才的文学家、数学家和天文学家，他在撒马尔罕主持修建了一座宏伟的天文台与一座伊斯兰大学，邀请众多数学家与天文学家齐聚一堂交流学习。他在天文台利用改良的六分仪对上千颗天体进行观测，并编撰了天文历表《齐吉·古列干》，其中记录的数据相比精确结果仅有数秒之差。他还计算出了精确的正弦和正切三角函数表，精确到小数点后至少八位。尽管在科学与文化领域取得了巨大的成就，兀鲁伯对政治却缺乏兴趣，以至于很多人认为沙哈鲁的第三子§Y拜宋豁儿§!更适合当苏丹。拜宋豁儿擅长治国理政并在贵族之间享有崇高的声望，却在36岁就英年早逝。他的三个儿子§Y阿老倒剌§!、§Y苏丹·穆罕默德§!和§Y阿卜勒-卡西姆·巴八儿§!继承了父亲的地位，担任总督协助祖父沙哈鲁管理国家。\n\n§O帖木儿文艺复兴§!\n尽管帖木儿残暴嗜杀，却对文艺有着超乎寻常的热爱。帖木儿复兴了衰落的§Y撒马尔罕城§!，并大力赞助伊斯兰世界各地的艺术家、诗人和历史学家进行文艺创作。帖木儿还主持修建了比比哈努姆清真寺、阿克萨拉伊宫、亚萨维陵等精美绝伦的建筑。帖木儿死后，科学与文艺在沙哈鲁、兀鲁伯以及王后高哈尔绍德的赞助下进一步发展并空前繁荣，撒马尔罕成为了媲美佛罗伦萨的世界科学与文艺中心之一，伊斯兰文明在河中得到复兴并重新进入黄金时代。\n\n§O沙哈鲁继承危机§!\n拜宋豁儿去世后，他的三个儿子成为了总督，其中§Y阿老倒剌§!镇守§Y费尔干纳§!，§Y苏丹·穆罕默德§!镇守§Y呼罗珊§!，§Y阿卜勒-卡西姆·巴八儿§!镇守§Y花剌子模§!。沙哈鲁为了锻炼不关心政治的继承人兀鲁伯，将其派往§Y喜萨尔§!抵御正在§Y阿富汗§!崛起的§Y卡尔提德王朝§!。从小高傲自负的苏丹·穆罕默德不干久居人下，在马什哈德发动叛乱并企图自立为王。将近70岁高龄的沙哈鲁御驾亲征以平定这个不孝子孙的叛乱，却因在行军途中受伤不得不返回撒马尔罕，而苏丹·穆罕默德没过多久便被§Y萨巴达尔人§!杀死。沙哈鲁受伤回到撒马尔罕后健康状况每况愈下，预计已命不久矣，继承问题却悬而未决。兀鲁伯本应是正统继承人，但王后高哈尔绍德却一直偏爱自己的孙子阿老倒剌，企图行废立之事，而巴八儿则在花剌子模冷眼旁观。北方的§Y月即别§!的§Y阿布海儿汗§!则已经统一了草原诸部落，随时准备挥师南下，就差一个合适的时机。所有人都在屏息等待..."
