He was born in Sayram, Isfijab, on the Central Asian steppe. His father, Ibrahim, is said to have been a descendant of Caliph Ali. He is considered one of the earliest Turkic poets, composing his Diwan-i Hikmet (Book of Wisdom) in Middle Turkic, establishing principles of asceticism and humble devotion. He was also a pioneer of mysticism, founding the first Turkic Sufi order—the Yasawiyya. By preaching in the Turkic language and reconciling Islam with traditional Turkic culture, he facilitated the widespread adoption of Islam among Turkic-speaking peoples. After his death, his disciples organized into orders (tariqas) to continue spreading his teachings. The mausoleum built for him by Timur became a holy site for the Turkic people. The subjects of [Root.GetName] hope that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will, like their ancestors, follow Yasawi's teachings and embrace Islam."

EDG_TIM_events.0.t:0 "Undercurrents"
EDG_TIM_events.0.d:0 "Timur the Lame, the fearsome conqueror who rose from the Western Chagatai Khanate, undefeated and unstoppable, established the great Gurkani Empire. Although the empire fractured and crumbled due to a betrayal by Nestorian Christians in Khorasan during Timur's campaign against the Ottomans, it managed to maintain its rule in Transoxiana. Timur had designated two heirs, both of whom unfortunately predeceased him. The new heir appointed by Timur on his deathbed, Pir Muhammad, lacked the prestige to hold the empire together. A brutal civil war erupted among Timur's descendants vying for the throne, ultimately won by Pir Muhammad's uncle, Shah Rukh, who defeated the other claimants and entered Samarkand.\n\nShah Rukh has now ruled the Gurkani for nearly forty years. Unlike his father Timur, Shah Rukh focused more on civil governance, resembling a humble Islamic Sultan more than a Turco-Mongol conqueror. Shah Rukh married Gawhar Shad, the daughter of a Persian noble, who long assisted her husband in managing the state. During Shah Rukh's reign, Transoxiana enjoyed prolonged peace and prosperity. Culture and the arts flourished under his generous patronage, and Samarkand became a world center of science and arts, rivaling Florence, while Islamic civilization experienced a renaissance and re-entered a golden age in the region.\n\nHowever, beneath this prosperity, undercurrents are stirring. Shah Rukh's arrogant grandson, Sultan Muhammad, serving as governor of Khorasan, launched a rebellion in Mashhad. The nearly 70-year-old Shah Rukh personally led an expedition to suppress it but was injured during the march and had to return to Samarkand. Sultan Muhammad was killed not long after by the Sarbadars. Since returning injured to Samarkand, Shah Rukh's health has steadily deteriorated, and everyone senses his time is near, yet the succession remains unresolved. Ulugh Beg is the designated legitimate heir, but the Queen, Gawhar Shad, has always favored her own grandson, Ala al-Dawla. Meanwhile, Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbek has united the steppe tribes to the north and is poised to march south, awaiting only the right moment. All hold their breath in anticipation..."
EDG_TIM_events.0.a:0 "§RThe fate of the Sultan determines the rise and fall of the nation!§!"

EDG_TIM_events.1.t:0 "The Death of Shah Rukh"
EDG_TIM_events.1.d:0 "The old Sultan, Shah Rukh, has passed away peacefully in his sleep. Ulugh Beg, who has been governing Hisar, is Shah Rukh's eldest son and thus the rightful heir. Upon receiving news of his father's death, Ulugh Beg is hastening back from Hisar to Samarkand to be crowned as the new Sultan. However, not everyone wishes to see Ulugh Beg's smooth succession. Ala al-Dawla, the eldest son of Baysunghur, is the beloved grandson of the Dowager Empress Gawhar Shad. Immediately after Shah Rukh's death, Gawhar Shad sent messengers to inform Ala al-Dawla, who governs Ferghana. Ulugh Beg's eldest son, Abd al-Latif, discovering this, suspected the Dowager Empress of intending to bypass his father and install Ala al-Dawla as the new Sultan. He therefore imprisoned the Empress and prepared to raise an army against Ala al-Dawla. Ala al-Dawla himself had already conspired and previously made a secret pact with Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbeks. Learning of the turmoil in Samarkand, he outright launched a rebellion, while Abu'l-Khayr Khan has also mobilized a great army to invade Transoxiana from the north, intervening in the Timurid succession crisis. Ala al-Dawla's act of inviting the wolf into the fold will ultimately backfire. If Ala al-Dawla is installed as the new Sultan, lacking legitimate foundations for his rule, he will inevitably become even more dependent on northern protection to maintain power, eventually becoming a puppet of the Uzbeks in Samarkand. Abu'l-Khayr Khan, with his predatory gaze, is no benign figure and will certainly not miss such an opportunity. The fate of the dynasty may hinge on this very conflict."

However, Ulugh Beg's rule was not precarious. Under Ulugh Beg's leadership, [Root.GetName] mounted an effective resistance against the Uzbek invasion. Although Abu'l-Khayr Khan achieved some gains in the early stages of the war against [Root.GetName], he soon found himself mired in a quagmire. The war's failures fueled growing discontent among the tribes towards [SHY.Monarch.GetName], forcing [SHY.Monarch.GetName] to choose retreat. The once-overweening Abu'l-Khayr Khan's path of conquest ultimately foundered at the gates of [TIM.GetName]. After repelling the Uzbek invasion, [Root.Monarch.GetName] captured Ala al-Dawla alive, severed his limbs, and cast him into the wilderness to be devoured by wolves. Through this victory, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] successfully established his authority and consolidated his rule.

But now it seems the Khan's momentary impulse has plunged the Ulus into a quagmire. Ulugh Beg's rule was not precarious; on the contrary, our unpopular puppet Ala al-Dawla provoked opposition from all factions within Timur's realm. United by shared interests, they resisted the invasion, causing our offensive to progress painfully slowly. Although Khan [Root.Monarch.GetName] was confident of eventually crushing Ulugh Beg, the tribes grew deeply dissatisfied, with some tribal leaders even beginning to challenge the Khan's authority.

EDG_TIM_events.6.d:0 "Ulugh Beg is Shah Rukh's eldest son and his designated heir. A prodigious literary scholar, mathematician, and astronomer who achieved great scientific accomplishments, Ulugh Beg shows little interest in politics, leading many to believe Shah Rukh's third son, Baysunghur, was more suited to be Sultan. Baysunghur excelled in statecraft and enjoyed high prestige among the nobility but died young at 36. His three sons, Ala al-Dawla, Sultan Muhammad, and Abul-Qasim Babur, inherited their father's status, serving as governors to assist Shah Rukh in ruling. Ala al-Dawla governs Ferghana, Sultan Muhammad governed Khorasan, and Abul-Qasim Babur governs Khwarezm. However, Sultan Muhammad rebelled in Khorasan and was later killed by the Sarbadars. To train his politically disinterested heir, Shah Rukh sent Ulugh Beg to Hisar to resist the rising Kartid dynasty in Afghanistan. Ulugh Beg is the designated successor of Sultan Shah Rukh, but now the Sultan lies on his deathbed. The Queen, Gawhar Shad, controls the court and favors Ala al-Dawla, her beloved grandson, intending to help him seize the throne. Ala al-Dawla himself has long conspired, forming a secret pact and alliance with Abu'l-Khayr Khan of the Uzbeks, plotting treachery. His brother Babur watches coldly from Khwarezm, waiting for his moment.

We plan to exploit the discord between Babur and his brother to persuade him to side with Ulugh Beg, but the ambitious Babur will not agree easily.

He was Ulugh Beg's most accomplished student and later succeeded Jamshid al-Kashi as the director of the Ulugh Beg Observatory. In his astronomical work, 'On the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy on Philosophy,' he opposed Aristotelian interventions in physics, refuted Aristotle's notions of a stationary Earth and uniform circular motion of celestial bodies, completely separated natural philosophy from astronomy, and promoted astronomy as a purely empirical and mathematical science. He provided empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation. His textbooks, 'Manual of Arithmetic' and 'Manual of Astronomy,' were also translated into Latin and circulated in Europe."

He would often gaze at the stars alone, marveling at the myriad constellations created by Allah, or tinker with various measuring instruments all day long. Because of this, people often said his younger brother Baysunghur was more suited to be Sultan. Later, he became a mathematician and astronomer. Using his position, he founded the Ulugh Beg Madrasa, gathering the greatest artists and scientists of the Islamic world to exchange ideas on artistic creation and scientific research. He built a magnificent observatory in Samarkand and invited the famous mathematician and astronomer Jamshid al-Kashi to oversee its work. At the observatory, using improved sextants, he observed thousands of celestial bodies. With the assistance of his disciple Ali Qushji, he compiled the astronomical tables known as the Zij-i Gurgani (Gurganic Tables), whose recorded data deviated from precise results by only a few seconds. In mathematics, he calculated highly accurate sine and tangent tables, precise to at least eight decimal places. However, the tides of time spare no one. As Sultan Shah Rukh grew old, Ulugh Beg had to gradually set aside his beloved astronomy to shoulder the responsibilities of an heir. To hone his military skills, Shah Rukh sent Ulugh Beg to Hisar to resist the rising Kartid dynasty in Afghanistan. Ulugh Beg had to bid farewell to Samarkand, leaving behind his madrasa and observatory. In Hisar, he lived up to expectations, repeatedly defeating invading Kartid forces at Balkh and Kunduz. Now, the relentless current of history has propelled this astronomer, long considered unfit to lead a nation, to the Sultan's throne. Ulugh Beg returned to the long-absent Samarkand, ascended the observatory, and once again looked up at the stars..."

Al-Kashi was a genius mathematician and astronomer, authoring astronomical works such as Sullam al-sama' (The Stairway of Heaven) and Risala fi alat al-Rusd (Treatise on Observational Instruments). The Stairway of Heaven explored and solved many problems encountered by predecessors in calculating the sizes and distances of celestial bodies, while the Treatise on Observational Instruments discussed various astronomical instruments. Al-Kashi also invented an analog computing instrument called the 'Plate of Conjunctions' for linear interpolation and calculating the times of planetary conjunctions, and a mechanical planetary calculator called the 'Plate of Zones' to predict the true positions of celestial bodies. In the field of mathematics, al-Kashi authored Risala al-Muhitiyya (Treatise on the Circumference), Miftah al-Hisab (The Key of Arithmetic), and al-Risala al-Watar wa'l-Jayb (Treatise on the Chord and Sine). He was the first to explicitly state the law of cosines in a form suitable for triangulation, which became known as 'Kashi's Theorem.'

Now we have learned from this lesson. However, our Turco-Mongol nobility excels at charging into battle but lacks expertise in statecraft. Therefore, we have had to appoint a large number of Persian bureaucrats to fill vacancies in the administrative apparatus.

The Court in Dadu (Beijing) periodically sent envoys to Samarkand demanding tribute from us. Timur repeatedly detained and humiliated Yuan envoys. Later, while planning his eastern campaign against China, Timur again dispatched envoys under the guise of tribute to gather intelligence. Shah Rukh, however, maintained good relations with the Yuan, and exchanges were frequent. During Shah Rukh's reign, Chen Cheng, a vice director from the Yuan Ministry of Personnel, was sent on five missions to Samarkand by imperial command, authoring Records of the Western Regions Journey and Gazetteer of Foreign Lands in the Western Regions. The Sultan also dispatched a tributary embassy led by the diplomat Khwaja Ghiyath al-Din Naqqash to visit various parts of China. Ghiyath al-Din's travelogue was printed and published, becoming an important reference for the historians Hafiz-i Abru and Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi in compiling their chronicles.

After failing to secure the succession against his brother Esen Buqa, he fled to Samarkand with his loyal followers seeking asylum. Ulugh Beg, who had not yet become the governor of Hisar, warmly received Yunus and his men, providing them with provisions on the condition that they first entered the fortress to register their names. However, it was then that the highly learned astronomer revealed a ruthless side. After Yunus and all his men had entered the fortress, Ulugh Beg suddenly ordered the gates closed, turning the fortress into a bloody slaughterhouse. All tribal leaders except Yunus were massacred, and the rest were taken captive. Following this tragedy, Yunus was presented as a prize by Ulugh Beg to his father, Shah Rukh, who received Yunus and sponsored his studies in Iran. For decades thereafter, Yunus traveled and studied across Iran, becoming a student of the historian Sharaf al-Din Ali Yazdi, and eventually settled in Shiraz. Now, the gears of fate turn once more. As chaos intensifies within the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] has summoned Yunus back to Samarkand.

While the relationship between successive Khans and Dughlat chieftains had been relatively harmonious, the current Chagatai Khan, [CHG.Monarch.GetName], and the Dughlat chieftain, Muhammad Haydar Mirza, are locked in irreconcilable conflict. Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] has seized this opportunity of internal strife. He has provided troops to Yunus, whom he earlier recalled to Samarkand, to help him reclaim the Khanate. Yunus led his army back to Kashgar, where he was welcomed by Muhammad Haydar Mirza. The Dughlat tribe proclaimed Yunus the new Eastern Chagatai Khan, challenging [CHG.Monarch.GetName]'s rule.

EDG_TIM_events.86.d:0 "Since the conversion of the Chagatai Khanate to Islam, the process of Islamization began beyond the Jade Gate in the Western Regions. Sufism, in particular, found favor with local emirs. With our conquest of Northwestern China, numerous Sufi orders surged into the region from Bukhara, Urgench, Samarkand, and elsewhere. They merged with existing Islamic sects and, under the influence of local culture, formed the Menhuan system. Menhuans are Sufi religious orders; their leaders are called 'Daozu' or 'Zhenren' and hold supreme status within the order. Menhuans almost exclusively belong to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. The four main Menhuans are: 'Qadiriyya,' 'Kubrawiyya,' 'Khufiyya,' and 'Jahriyya.' Qadiriyya and Kubrawiyya belong to the Qadiri and Kubrawi orders respectively, while both Khufiyya and Jahriyya originated from the Naqshbandi order. Khufiyya, also known as the 'Whispering School,' advocates silent, low-voiced remembrance (dhikr). Jahriyya, or the 'Loud School,' in contrast to the earlier arriving Khufiyya, advocates audible, loud recitation of dhikr.\n\nIn fact, before Sufism's introduction and dominance, a more localized form of Islam had already taken root. This sect is called 'Gedimu' (Qadim), meaning 'ancient,' hence also known as the 'Old Sect.' It entered China as early as the Tang and Song dynasties, making it the oldest Islamic sect in China. Gedimu reveres orthodoxy, devoutly adheres to old rules and traditions, emphasizes minute ritual details, opposes Sufism, and has incorporated numerous Han Chinese elements into religious rites and architecture. However, with the rise of Sufism and Menhuans, Gedimu has gradually declined.\n\nSimultaneously, many Muslim literati in the region, seeking to resist the influence of Central Asian Sufi orders, launched a movement of 'Interpreting the Classics through Confucianism'—the 'Confucian-Islamic Synthesis.' Scholars of this synthesis proposed the idea that 'while elucidating the Heavenly Principles, it truly glorifies our Confucianism.' Using Chinese as their mother tongue, they introduced Confucian concepts and terminology, attempting to construct a system of Chinese Islam.\n\nAfter conquering China, we will inevitably need to utilize more sinicized Islamic sects to govern China's Muslim population. Therefore, we must choose a sect to serve as the dominant ideology for ruling Chinese Muslims."

However, although Gawhar Shad played a crucial role during Shah Rukh's reign, she interfered in state affairs after his death, favoring her beloved grandson Ala al-Dawla in the succession issue, leading to severe chaos. When the succession crisis erupted, Ulugh Beg's son, Abd al-Latif, imprisoned his grandmother Gawhar Shad, and she remains confined. The old Sultan considered releasing her, but as the nation descended into chaos once more, the plan was shelved. Some conspirators began to exploit Gawhar Shad's situation.

His words and deeds were compiled by his followers, and he was buried in Bukhara after his death. The term 'Naqshband' means 'painter' in Persian, as members of the order would trace lines on their chests with their fingers while silently reciting the Quran to dispel distractions and outline the perfect inner realm of truth.

He authored the poetry collection 'Divan-i Hikmet' in Middle Turkic, establishing principles of asceticism and humble devotion. He preached in the Turkic language, reconciling Islam with traditional Turkic culture, and was a primary force in converting the Turkic peoples of Central Asia to Islam.

Kubra was killed by the Mongol army during the siege of Gurganj, but his followers preserved his teachings. The Kubrawi Order adheres to Gnosticism and is enthusiastic about seeking the meaning of visions through rituals and meditation.

After completing his studies, he wandered the deserts of Iraq for 25 years, eventually returning to Baghdad in his later years to teach hadith and combine Islamic law with mysticism. Although Qadir belonged to the Hanbali school, he placed the Shafi'i and Hanbali legal schools on equal footing and issued fatwas based on both, leading people to regard him as a Sheikh of both the Hanbali and Shafi'i schools. The Qadiri Order emphasizes inner purification and divine love and profoundly influenced Nur ad-Din and Saladin.

string_start_timurids:0 "§O"Timur the Lame"§!\nIf one were to ask who was the most fearsome conqueror after §YGenghis Khan§!, it would undoubtedly be §Y"Timur the Lame"§!. Timur rose from the §YWestern Chagatai Khanate§!. As the son-in-law of the Western Chagatai Khan, bearing the title "§YGürkani§!" (son-in-law), he controlled the government and ultimately deposed the puppet khan, proclaiming himself Sultan. Timur swept across Iran undefeated, establishing the great §YGürkani Empire§!. Wherever Timur's armies marched, rivers of blood flowed and bones lay scattered across the earth. To this day, the Iranians have not forgotten the fear of being dominated under Timur's iron hoof. However, while Timur was on his expedition against the §YOttomans§! to punish the arrogant Sultan §Y"Lightning" Bayezid§!, §YNestorian Christians§! in §YKhorasan§! took advantage of the empire's weakened rear to launch a rebellion, with Iranians across the region joining the uprising. Timur's army was forced to retreat in haste. Although this great conqueror was undefeated in battle, his attitude toward newly conquered lands was one of control without governance. After the great Iranian rebellion, Timur's rule in Iran quickly crumbled, forcing him to retreat to his power base in §YTransoxiana§!. In his later years, Timur assembled a massive army, planning an eastern campaign against the §YEastern Chagatai Khanate§! to march through and seize the Yuan capital of Dadu. However, this grand plan to invade the §YGreat Yuan Empire§! was abruptly interrupted by Timur's death.\n\n§OSultan Shah Rukh§!\nTimur had designated two heirs: his eldest son §YJahangir§! and his eldest grandson §YMuhammad Sultan§!. Unfortunately, both heirs predeceased Timur, and on his deathbed, Timur designated his grandson §YPir Muhammad§! as the new successor. However, Pir Muhammad lacked prestige and was unable to maintain control over the empire after Timur's death. To seize the throne, a brutal civil war erupted among Timur's descendants. Ultimately, Pir Muhammad's fourth uncle, §YShah Rukh§!, defeated the other claimants and entered §YSamarkand§!. Shah Rukh has ruled the Gürkani for nearly forty years. Unlike his father Timur, Shah Rukh focused more on civil governance; rather than a Turco-Mongol conqueror, he resembled a humble Islamic sultan. During his reign, Transoxiana enjoyed prolonged peace and prosperity. Shah Rukh married §YGawhar Shad§!, the daughter of a Persian noble. Gawhar Shad long assisted her husband in governing the state. Under her influence, Persian language and culture flourished domestically, becoming one of the empire's key cultural elements.\n\n§OThe Sons of Ulugh Beg and Baysunghur§!\n§YUlugh Beg§! is Shah Rukh's eldest son and designated heir. Ulugh Beg is also a gifted literary scholar, mathematician, and astronomer. In Samarkand, he oversaw the construction of a magnificent observatory and an Islamic university, inviting numerous mathematicians and astronomers to gather and exchange knowledge. At his observatory, using an improved sextant, he observed thousands of celestial bodies and compiled the astronomical tables known as the Zij-i Gürkani, whose recorded data differed from precise results by only a few seconds. He also calculated precise sine and tangent trigonometric tables accurate to at least eight decimal places. Despite his immense achievements in science and culture, Ulugh Beg showed little interest in politics, leading many to believe that Shah Rukh's third son, §YBaysunghur§!, was better suited to be Sultan. Baysunghur excelled at statecraft and enjoyed high prestige among the nobility but died young at 36. His three sons—§YAla al-Dawla§!, §YSultan Muhammad§!, and §YAbul-Qasim Babur§!—inherited their father's position, serving as governors to assist their grandfather Shah Rukh in governing the realm.\n\n§OTimurid Renaissance§!\nDespite Timur's brutality and bloodthirst, he possessed an extraordinary passion for the arts. Timur revived the declining §Ycity of Samarkand§! and generously sponsored artists, poets, and historians from across the Islamic world to create works of art and literature. Timur also oversaw the construction of exquisite buildings such as the Bibi-Khanym Mosque, the Ak-Saray Palace, and the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi. After Timur's death, science and the arts further developed and flourished unprecedentedly under the patronage of Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg, and Queen Gawhar Shad. Samarkand became a global center of science and art rivaling Florence. Islamic civilization experienced a revival in Transoxiana, re-entering a golden age.\n\n§OShah Rukh's Succession Crisis§!\nAfter Baysunghur's death, his three sons became governors: §YAla al-Dawla§! was stationed in §YFerghana§!, §YSultan Muhammad§! in §YKhorasan§!, and §YAbul-Qasim Babur§! in §YKhwarazm§!. To train his politically disinterested heir Ulugh Beg, Shah Rukh sent him to §YHissar§! to resist the rising §YKartid Dynasty§! in §YAfghanistan§!. The proud and arrogant Sultan Muhammad, unwilling to remain subordinate, launched a rebellion in Mashhad, attempting to proclaim himself king. The nearly 70-year-old Shah Rukh personally led a campaign to quell this unfilial grandson's rebellion but was injured during the march and had to return to Samarkand. Not long after, Sultan Muhammad was killed by the §YSarbadars§!. After returning injured to Samarkand, Shah Rukh's health deteriorated rapidly, and his death seemed imminent, yet the succession remained unresolved. Ulugh Beg is the rightful heir, but Queen Gawhar Shad has always favored her grandson Ala al-Dawla, attempting to depose and install a new heir, while Babur watches coldly from Khwarazm. To the north, §YUzbek§!'s §YKhan Abu'l-Khayr§! has unified the steppe tribes and stands ready to march south at any moment, awaiting only the opportune time. Everyone holds their breath and waits..."
