EDG_WAL_walrys_piercing_collar_desc:0 "'Walrys' refers to the ruler of Wallachia, and 'piercing' represents Voivode Dracula's severe punitive measures. Before the Great Voivode Dracula ascended the throne, Wallachia was an obscure minor state, constantly manipulated by others. The life of this Voivode Dracula was exceedingly bloody, and he took pleasure in impaling opponents and captives alive on stakes, then erecting the stakes with bodies along roadsides to terrorize the populace. He frequently carried out purges against the Boyar landowners, beginning his life of impaling people on stakes. And Wallachia, through him, became famous abroad, a household name. In a sense, he achieved immortality through this."

His rule is famous for its high-pressure and terrifying severity, as well as his ruthless and twisted treatment of others."

The various atrocities that followed made the people numb and fearful, obeying the Great Voivode's commands and charging into battle time and again, tireless."

WAL_ideas_1:0 "Gaze of a Hawk, Glance of a Wolf"
WAL_ideas_1_desc:0 "Wallachia's foreign policy has never been pleasant, yet it always manages to accurately press upon the psychological bottom line of others, adept at lowering opponents' expectations.

WAL_ideas_3:0 "Oppressive Production Act"
WAL_ideas_3_desc:0 "Voivode Dracula achieves his rule through extreme oppression of all people.

This also causes merchants to avoid the country, while the people struggle to survive in boundless darkness."
WAL_ideas_4:0 "Impalement Punishment"
WAL_ideas_4_desc:0 "Voivode Dracula's famous system involves using wooden stakes to impale resisters. He delights in their death wails and agony, as if attending a grand banquet and listening to elegant, beautiful music. They cannot kill Voivode Dracula nor end his rule, but can only gradually fade away, striving to appease the Voivode's twisted pleasures."
WAL_ideas_5:0 "On-the-Spot Military Requisition System"
