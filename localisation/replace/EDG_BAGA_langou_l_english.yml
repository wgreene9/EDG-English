EDG_HZB_rev_disater_1_d: "Since its founding, the Ilkhanate has relied on Persians. Even now, our court is filled with a large number of Persians. However, with our governance over Egypt and India, our small court has gradually seen the emergence of more people from other ethnicities. The Persians have grown jealous, believing that without them, the current [Root.GetName] would not exist. First, one Persian went on strike, then Persians in the court, and finally, this fire spread across the entire Persian region. The purpose gradually escalated from the initial struggle for favor to questioning the legitimacy of Mongol rule."
