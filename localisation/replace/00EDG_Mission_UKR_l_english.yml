EDG_UKR_mission_1_9_desc:0 "Peter I's reform activities, conducted mainly during the Great Northern War, meant that many of his measures centered on military reform. Thus, Marx believed that Peter's "entire enterprise hinged on the conquest of the Baltic coast." To defeat Sweden, a formidable European power, and seize a seaport, Peter began reorganizing the army even before the Northern War. In 1700, Peter ordered the abolition of the Streltsy and implemented a conscription system, decreeing that all social classes, regardless of nobility, were equal in military service. During Peter's reign, 53 levies were conducted, forcibly recruiting approximately 284,000 men. To improve the technical and command abilities of military officers, Peter sent many young nobles to study military affairs in Italy, France, England, the Netherlands, and other countries, and hired foreigners with substantial sums to hold key positions in the Russian army. By 1721, 14 of Russia's notable commanders were foreigners. Simultaneously, various military schools, technical academies, and training courses were established domestically to vigorously cultivate military talent. To enhance the army's organization and combat effectiveness, Peter I personally oversaw the drafting of important military regulations and charters. The famous "Military Statute" was promulgated in 1716. It summarized the experience of the Northern War, contained the fundamental principles of drill and tactical training, and defined the organizational principles of the army."

EDG_UKR_mission_3_2_desc:0 "In 1380, Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, with Timur's aid, defeated Mamai, the powerful minister of the Great Khan's court, and gained control over the main territories of the Golden Horde, becoming its Great Khan. However, the Golden Horde had experienced a bloody internal conflict, weakening its control over the western Kievan Rus' region. The Prince of Kiev, Ivan I of the Rurik dynasty, became the Golden Horde's agent in the Kievan Rus', but Ivan I harbored his own ambitions. By the late 14th century, as the Golden Horde gradually declined, Ivan I consolidated his position within the Kievan Rus', successfully repelled attacks from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and even seized the principalities of Turov and Minsk from the Lithuanians. Ivan I died of illness in Kiev in 1440 at the age of 83. His son, Andrei I, was incompetent and foolish. At Ivan I's funeral, he disrespected the feudal rights of the other princes and, to curry favor with the Golden Horde, imposed exorbitant taxes and levies throughout the Kievan Rus', sparking the Kievan Rus' civil war that began in December 1443. The principalities of Galicia-Volhynia, the Zaporozhian Hetmanate, and Chernigov all declared independence, each claiming the right to become the new Grand Prince of the Kievan Rus', plunging into a chaotic war for control of Kiev. Meanwhile, the Prince of Turov and the Archbishop of Minsk watched from the sidelines, striving to defend against the Lithuanians to the north without the protection of the Kievan Rus' Grand Prince."

EDG_UKR_mission_3_3_title:0 "Feather of the Black Eagle"
EDG_UKR_mission_3_3_desc:0 "A unified Chernigov Principality had disappeared by the early 14th century. The land was originally ruled by the Rurik dynasty, but its Rurik rulers rebelled against the Golden Horde and were ultimately eradicated. In the early 15th century, the principality was re-established, and the princely title was granted to the largest local family—the Chernigov family, who ruled the city of Chernigov itself. Prince Yevgeny of Chernigov, who succeeded in 1411, initially had no desire to contend for hegemony over the Kievan Rus', but he was even more unwilling to submit to Galicia-Volhynia or Zaporozhie. Thus, in 1443, he issued a self-defense declaration, emphasizing Chernigov's defensive stance in the chaotic conflict."
