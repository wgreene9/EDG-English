EDG_ETHEvents.0.name:0 "The Solomonic Dynasty of Ethiopia"
EDG_ETHEvents.0.desc:0 "It has been 170 years since 1270, when Yekuno Amlak overthrew the Zagwe dynasty, restoring the Solomonic dynasty to the throne of Ethiopia.\n\nThe political system and feudal structure established by Amda Seyon I have endured to this day, including the implementation of a mobile capital and direct provincial garrisons. These two institutions would become the foundation of the Ethiopian Empire—and perhaps, in the future, stumbling blocks to its development.\n\nIn a region of East Africa where almost all nations adhere to Islam, Ethiopia holds fast to the ancient Coptic Church as its state religion, maintaining Christianity's last bastion in East Africa. Surrounded by infidels, this ancient empire is nonetheless remarkably bellicose, having continuously expanded its territory over the past century and utterly destroyed the Sultanate of Ifat during the reign of Dawit I. However, with the Walashma dynasty, the last sultans of Ifat, reestablishing their rule in East Africa, Ethiopia has gained a new formidable rival—the Sultanate of Adal. Adal constantly seeks to decisively defeat this pagan power entrenched within the Muslim world of East Africa, ever waiting for a moment of weakness in the ancient empire.\n\nDue to the electoral succession law established by the Ethiopian Empire, almost every succession becomes a terrible war of inheritance. Therefore, since the time of Amda Seyon, the Ethiopian Empire has imprisoned all imperial princes, with the royal family electing who shall be released to ascend the throne upon a succession. It was under these circumstances that Zara Yaqob developed qualities of resolute perseverance, calmness, and a love for learning, demonstrating exceptional capability after ascending the throne in 1434.\n\nHis father had already thoroughly ignited the flames of war with the Sultanate of Adal, vowing to fight the infidels to the end, and Zara Yaqob followed in his father's footsteps, beginning campaigns eastward against the Sultanate of Adal. During Zara Yaqob's campaign against the Sultanate of Hadiya in the southern part of the empire, he captured and held as a hostage Eleni, the daughter of the Agaw tribal chieftain within the sultanate, later forcibly marrying her to solidify imperial control over the Sultanate of Hadiya. After Eleni converted to the Coptic Orthodox faith, her relationship with Zara Yaqob improved, and she demonstrated remarkable talent in administration and diplomacy, greatly assisting Zara Yaqob's rule.\n\nWithout a doubt, under the leadership of Zara Yaqob, the ancient Ethiopian Empire will once again usher in an era of its own."

EDG_ETHEvents.1.name:0 "The Rist-Gult System"
EDG_ETHEvents.1.desc:0 "Since the decline of Aksum, for most of its past, Ethiopia lacked currency. This not only affected economic development to some extent but also created significant difficulties in managing and maintaining a large army. Surrounded by infidels, successive Ethiopian emperors inevitably expanded their armies and prepared for holy wars against Muslims. However, with almost no currency in circulation, a unique system emerged under these circumstances: the Rist-Gult system.\n\nThe Rist system is equivalent to a yeoman system, but these yeomen possess incomplete ownership of the land. They can inherit and transfer land but must pay a portion of their harvest to the nobility and provide certain services to them. The Gult system refers to a type of feudal land-grant system in Ethiopian history, particularly prevalent during the Zagwe and Solomonic dynasties. Holders of these grants (Gult) only had the right to collect taxes from the land and were required to provide military service to the emperor in exchange; otherwise, the emperor would revoke their privileges.\n\nUnable to pay soldiers' wages, the emperor often granted land to soldiers in the form of tribute, allowing them to obtain the means of subsistence from it. Although many lords, courtiers, and even minor officials received land grants, most soldiers received neither state-paid wages nor adequate livelihood guarantees. Therefore, the task of providing sustenance for soldiers passing through villages inevitably fell upon the peasants, which in turn significantly impacted their enthusiasm for production and productivity.\n\nAlthough this system severely affected agricultural production activities, it is undeniable that without it, Ethiopia could not have assembled a large army to defend the empire without substantial expenditure."

EDG_ETHEvents.2.desc:0 "After the fall of Aksum, the north fractured into several tribal kingdoms and has been facing threats from the Muslims of Egypt. We now have sufficient strength to make them sit down and negotiate with us.\n\nDue to the rebellion incited by [ABB.GetName] in central Nubia, both [MAK.GetName] and [ALO.GetName] have lost parts of their territory in the region. Therefore, they have promised that if we can help them crush this rebellion and reclaim their lost lands, [MAK.GetName] and [ALO.GetName] will swear allegiance to the King of Kings.\n\n[ABB.GetName] poses little threat to us. Launching a major expedition against them seems like an overreaction. Perhaps we should first attempt to negotiate with those infidels—provided they are still capable of responding to our demands."
