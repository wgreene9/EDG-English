EDG_flavorENG_mission.1.d:0 "The three Baronial Wars brought grave calamities upon England.\n\nJohn Lackland's devastation of England did not cease with his passing into the heavenly beyond. The Magna Carta became a veritable talisman for England's nobility, and victory in the First Baronial War only added further privileges to this charter.\n\nIn 1216 AD, the French Dauphin Louis, alongside rebellious barons, defeated the Royal Army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings from a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding the power of local nobles. This was the Second Baronial War. Following this conflict, in the early years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a mere pawn manipulated by the earls, who gained far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts.\n\nIn 1258, when Henry III sought parliamentary funds to expand the standing army, English nobles led by the Earls of Norfolk, Gloucester, and Leicester demanded broader decentralization of power in exchange for the cash. The conflict between king and barons erupted completely, leading to the Third Baronial War. This war ended with the Earl of Leicester's great victory at the Battle of Lewes and his subsequent march into London. Henry III, like his predecessor, was defeated by the angry lords. The Earls of Leicester and Norfolk were both elevated to dukes.\n\nThe ever-expanding power of the nobility forced royal authority to increasingly retreat into the southeast corner of England, effectively making the monarch the 'Earl of London.' The close advisor, the Earl of Cornwall, was forced into exile twice under pressure from a group of nobles led by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, a royal kinsman. Defeat in the border wars of Northumberland and the Great Famine of 1315–1317 dealt heavy blows to this disaster-stricken kingdom. The king's final attempt to break free from the control of the unruly barons inevitably failed. After his last loyal minister, the Earl of Winchester, was defeated and executed, the reign of Edward II came to an end.\n\nAfter Edward II's death, his son Edward III, 'the Wise,' inherited the heavy crown, but the true rulers of England were Queen Mother Isabella of France (a primary driver in deposing her husband) and her lover Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, along with the Council of Barons he led. Edward III proved far more capable than his mediocre father, significantly curtailing the power of the Council of Barons and even persuading them to agree to his personal assumption of the title Earl of Lancaster.\n\nAs time passed, the throne eventually came to the current king, Richard VI. Richard cannot be called a particularly talented monarch, but he is at least a competent preserver of the realm. Through painstaking effort, England has finally broken free from the shackles of the Baronial Wars. It is now time to consider the next steps."

EDG_flavorENG_mission.2.t:0 "An Expanded Anglo-French War?"
EDG_flavorENG_mission.2.d:0 "The current history of the Kingdom of England can be traced back to the Norman Conquest. In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, 'the Conqueror,' along with other French feudal lords from regions such as Normandy, Brittany, and Picardy, invaded England. King Harold of England fell in battle at Hastings, and William was crowned King of England at Westminster Abbey in London. For a long time, the English monarchy bore strong characteristics of French feudal nobility. Successive generations of English monarchs were unwilling to relinquish their territories in France and consistently sought to expand their influence on the European continent.\n\nThe most recent invasion occurred in 1429. Louis VII, King of Lotharingia, laid claim to the French throne, intending to be crowned King of France at Reims. England saw this as a golden opportunity and soon landed in Normandy, while Arles invaded from the south. This became known historically as the 'War of the Four Kingdoms.'\n\nThe War of the Four Kingdoms ultimately ended in a comprehensive victory for France. Although we still hold the Norman territories in northern France, we must now consider a serious question: should we continue to escalate the Anglo-French war, or should we bring the conflict with France to an end?"

However, a question now stands before us:\n\nWe have failed to capture the Capetian royal family of France. They have fled in haste further south. How should we treat them? Should we pursue the fleeing foe with our remaining vigor, swiftly moving south to continue eradicating the House of Capet?

EDG_flavorENG_mission.4.d:0 "Our comprehensive victory in the war with France has greatly shaken the appanage nobles of France, particularly our taking of Paris, which dealt them a heavy blow. As in the past, these appanage nobles have begun to waver and vacillate in their stances.\n\nEver since Hugues Capet seized the French throne from the declining Carolingian dynasty of West Francia, Hugues Capet and his descendants attributed the fundamental reason for the Carolingian collapse to their failure to firmly root their family's power in the kingdom's soil. Consequently, the Capetian family enthusiastically spread its branches throughout the nation, establishing cadet branches in various regions to prevent another powerful vassal from wresting the throne away from the Capetians.\n\nHowever, this French practice is now bearing bitter fruit. As relationships between the main Capetian line and its cadet branches have grown strained with the dilution of blood ties, and these branches control regional power, the French king is confined to the small Île-de-France. The cadet branches have even formed a 'Public Weal' alliance to force the king into submission.\n\nNow the French king has fled in haste, while we still retain the title of Duke of Normandy, making us, nominally, one of the appanage nobles of France. Perhaps we can attempt to use this connection to persuade the French appanage nobles to switch their allegiance to us."

EDG_flavorENG_mission.5.d:0 "'Defender of Normandy' Henry III, an exemplary figure of the House of Plantagenet.\n\nHe was the son of the notorious King John Lackland. In 1216 AD, King John died amidst shock and rebellion. His son, Henry III, was crowned the new king. However, the intervening French Dauphin Louis, alongside rebellious barons, defeated the Royal Army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings from a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding the power of local nobles. In the early years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a mere pawn manipulated by the earls, who gained far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts. Some even secretly formed factions to support his cousin, Eleanor of Brittany, in inheriting the throne. Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, reached a superficial reconciliation with the king, but underlying tensions between king and barons persisted, culminating in a complete rupture in 1258.\n\nThe year before, in 1257, Henry III led the Royal Guard to a successful victory over France at Rouen, reclaiming control of Normandy. Henry III then demanded the expansion of the standing army directly under royal command, but this required an additional allocation of funds and higher feudal dues. In the spring of 1258, when Henry III sought parliamentary funds to expand the standing army, English nobles led by the Earls of Norfolk, Gloucester, and Leicester demanded broader decentralization of power in exchange for the cash. The conflict between king and barons erupted completely, leading to the Third Baronial War.\n\nThe Third Baronial War ended with the Earl of Leicester's great victory at the Battle of Lewes and his subsequent march into London. Henry III, like his predecessor, was defeated by the angry lords. The Earls of Leicester and Norfolk were both elevated to dukes. Meanwhile, in northern England, the Scottish noble Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, led forces to occupy lands around his father's barony in Northumberland. The earl proclaimed, 'I am Earl of Angus in Scotland, and Earl of Northumberland in England.' Due to the defeat in the Baronial Wars, Henry III had little reach over Northumberland and could only acquiesce to its semi-independent status. In 1272, the 'Defender of Normandy,' Henry III, passed away at Westminster. His eldest son, Edward I, 'Longshanks' and 'Hammer of the Scots,' took up the royal scepter."

Since the House of Capet drove the declining and decadent Carolingian dynasty from the throne of West Francia, the Capetian family, marked by the fleur-de-lis, ascended the stage of history, reigning over the entire French region for a considerable period.\n\nFor ages, Hugues Capet and his successors firmly believed that the fundamental reason for the Carolingian decline and failure was their failure to extensively branch out and embed family influence into every aspect of the kingdom. Consequently, the Capetians were highly enthusiastic about extensively employing close relatives as vassals and enfeoffing them across the country. Most of these vassals held significant power, forming France's unique system of noble appanages. Over time, the blood ties between the appanages and the king grew increasingly distant, as did their political and military alignment. Nevertheless, the Fleur-de-Lis Crown still exerted a powerful binding force upon them.\n\nNow, as the former French noble appanages have successively pledged their loyalty to us, and through our efforts, the branches of the House of Plantagenet have gradually usurped the actual authority of each appanage, the time has come to consider how we should treat this French Fleur-de-Lis Crown."

However, in 1203, things began to change.\n\nWhen the Bogomil heresy spread from the East to the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, this Gnostic Christian sect gained significant traction in Occitania and directly impacted northern Italy before the Papal See. In 1203 AD, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade against the rampant 'Cathar' heresy. Apart from the Pope, the crusade's greatest supporter was their liege lord, the King of France. The leader of the Cathars was Count Raymond II of Toulouse, who became the paramount lord of the Languedoc nobility. Before the war began, the Count attempted to reach a degree of reconciliation with the Papacy, converting to Catholicism to avoid his lands being ravaged by war, yet he still secretly harbored Cathars within his domains and surrounding areas. The war ultimately proved unavoidable and became known as the 'First Albigensian Crusade.'\n\nThe First Albigensian Crusade ultimately ended in Cathar victory. The Pope unified the revocation of the crusade against Languedoc and accepted the nominal conversion of the southern French nobility, but the Pope was also forced to relinquish administrative jurisdiction over the Occitan Church, retaining only the right to tax Church lands. Broadly speaking, however, the victors were the Cathars.\n\nIn the summer of 1256 AD, the Pope and the French king launched the Second Albigensian Crusade. Raymond VII, the old Count's heir, clearly did not possess his father's military prowess. The French king's armies achieved successive victories in the Rhône Valley, but Raymond VII was more astute in diplomacy.

As a Catholic, he joined the Papal-led Crusades, serving as a commander in the Third Crusade. At the Battle of Arsuf, he defeated the Muslim forces commanded by Saladin against numerical odds, triumphing over Saladin three times despite being outnumbered. He is universally recognized as one of the most outstanding military commanders of the European Middle Ages.\n\nRichard embodied the ideal king of his era, wholly dedicated to the Crusades and defending his ancestral lands. He showed little interest in governmental administration; he was a great warrior who led from the front, an exceptional king and wise commander. His title, 'the Lionheart,' is apt. His fame endures, not only for his wars and treaties with Saladin, which altered the political landscape of the eastern Mediterranean coast, but also for the legacy of chivalry and romantic legends he left behind.\n\nIn military terms, his courage in campaign and leadership talent are undeniable. He demonstrated to the world his ability as one of the few generals capable of organizing and coordinating the complex forces of a Crusade. His military performance established him as one of the Middle Ages' most distinguished military commanders.\n\nContemporary Muslim historians also held him in high esteem. For instance, Baha ad-Din, Saladin's biographer, considered Richard 'possessed outstanding courage and a great soul.' Another chronicler, Ibn al-Athir, remarked that 'Richard was valiant, resourceful, energetic, and exceedingly patient. These qualities sufficed to make him the most prominent figure of his era.' The British Nobel laureate T.S. Eliot commented, 'After all, our king fought a splendid battle at Acre.'\n\nRichard the Lionheart's life is filled with legendary color. His bravery, political wisdom, and tragic fate have made him one of the most captivating figures in medieval English history.\n\nAlthough his reign was fraught with turbulence and challenges, his heroic deeds and steadfast faith continue to inspire future generations to forge ahead."

In 1382, the Archbishop of Canterbury pressured some Oxford Lollards to renounce their views, but the sect continued to expand. In 1414, the Lollard Council openly raised the flag of rebellion in East Anglia against English royal rule. Richard V immediately mounted a powerful counterattack, and the uprising was brutally suppressed. However, due to the overall decline and turbulence within the Catholic world, this rebellion did not mark the end of the Lollards' public political influence. Increasing numbers of commoners and preachers began openly or secretly embracing Lollardy, gradually slipping beyond the control of the English rulers.\n\nBy 1444, large numbers of believers in southern England had converted to Lollardy, and the East Anglia region had established its own Lollard church, breaking away from the control of the Roman Papacy. The rulers of East Anglia also held Lollard doctrines as their guiding principles, establishing a Lollard Council subordinate to the duke to manage local Lollard believers and provide support for the ruler.\n\nNow, the Duke of East Anglia has been captured by us, and the independent rule of the Lollards in East Anglia has been swept into the dustbin of history. It has been proposed to erect a monument here to commemorate the illustrious reputation Richard V earned as the 'Heretic-Crusher.'"

Theoretically, the region had long belonged to England. Unfortunately, after Richard the Lionheart's death, his nephew Arthur inherited the title of Duke of Ireland. During his reign, he was known for his kindness and approachability. Though a foreign ruler, he was once called the 'Guardian of Ireland' by the Irish people. For the welfare and development of Ireland, Arthur, 'the Guardian of Ireland,' who inherited the Dukedom of Ireland, repeatedly opposed John Lackland, the son of Richard the Lionheart who inherited the English throne—a ruler both incompetent and jealous of talent. Arthur was ultimately killed by John Lackland in 1203.\n\nAfter the death of Arthur, 'the Guardian of Ireland,' John Lackland imposed harsh taxes and levies in Ireland. The great Irish nobles grew dissatisfied with John's rule and finally rose in rebellion in 1204, causing the Plantagenet dynasty to completely lose control over Ireland. Seizing the opportunity, the great Irish nobles rose to prominence. Over the next two hundred years, numerous heroes emerged. Ulster, Meath, Tyrone, Kildare, Offaly, Tir Connail, Sligo, Clanricarde, Thomond, Ormond, Leinster, Desmond, Munster—countless independent lords appeared on the small island of Ireland. Any feudal landholder with wealth and an army dared to proclaim themselves king, carving out autonomous territories, plunging the entire island into chaos.\n\nWhile the Irish people celebrated their liberation from England, they soon realized they had not escaped hardship. After the collapse of upper-class rule, the great nobles attempted to establish independent states within their domains, leading to endless internecine warfare and slaughter. The Emerald Isle descended once more into endless turmoil. For a long time, as both Scotland and the Kingdom of England focused on each other, Ireland remained largely untouched by either, maintaining its fragmented state since 1204. For two centuries, Ireland was never substantially unified by any power.\n\nIn 1444, although Ireland achieved brief unification, the divisions and conflicts among the clans were far from settled. Upon completing our conquest of Ireland, we realized the matter was not so simple. Defeating the High King of Ireland was just the beginning; integrating the various clans was the key challenge.\n\nOf course, some have argued that §Rthe internecine warfare among Irish clan lords brought endless disaster to the Irish people§!, and that §GEngland is the savior of the Irish people§!."

Arthur accompanied Richard on the Crusades, held key positions in the council, assisted Richard in state affairs, and was entrusted with important responsibilities. After Richard completed the conquest of Ireland, Arthur was appointed Duke of Ireland and sent to govern the island.\n\nArthur was well aware that, as a foreigner, ruling the fragmented and clan-ridden island of Ireland was no easy task. The Irish merely submitted to his uncle Richard's military might; beneath their surface allegiance lay deep-seated resentment. To win over the Irish, Arthur governed with a blend of kindness and authority, rewards and punishments, earning the affection of the local Irish people while establishing the royal dignity of the House of Plantagenet, truly a wise ruler.\n\nUnfortunately, Arthur's story came to an abrupt end with the passing of Richard the Lionheart. After his uncle Richard's death, the English throne passed to John Lackland, a ruler marked by incompetence, jealousy of talent, and cruelty. Arthur was originally the capable assistant and right-hand man Richard had carefully chosen for John, but John rendered him powerless.

Increasing numbers of commoners and preachers began openly or secretly embracing Lollardy, gradually slipping beyond the control of the English rulers.\n\nBy 1444, large numbers of believers in southern England had converted to Lollardy.\n\nAcross the Channel, in England's continental territories, there exist numerous Waldensian believers and communities.\n\nThe Waldensians originated from the merchant Peter Waldo of Lyon, who, in 1173, renounced his wealth in imitation of the Apostles and devoted himself to preaching. Many Catholic clergy followed him into a life of poverty and missionary work. Between 1175 and 1185, Waldo commissioned a Lyonnais priest to translate the New Testament into the vernacular. In 1179, Waldo was even invited to an audience with Pope Alexander III and attended the Third Lateran Council.\n\nIn 1180, for disobeying the decisions of the Third Lateran Council, particularly regarding unauthorized biblical interpretation, Waldo was expelled from Lyon. Thereafter, the Waldensians became a mobile secret society, connecting with local Waldensian secret groups for prayer before secretly moving to the next location.\n\nAlthough the Waldensians faced long-term persecution, they never perished. The failures of the Albigensian Crusade and the Varna Crusade, the stagnation of the Reconquista, and the success of the Hussite movement all symbolized the gradual decline of the Catholic world. During this period of Papal weakness, the Waldensians expanded significantly, developing substantially within the French region.\n\nFaced with this complex domestic religious situation, how should we proceed?"

EDG_ENG_flavorENG.1.d:0 "Past History\n\nIn the world of 'Entrance to the Desolate Ground,' England took a distinctly different path after the death of the infamous King John Lackland. Clearly, the devastation wrought by John Lackland did not cease with his departure to the heavenly beyond. The Magna Carta became a veritable talisman for the English nobility, and victory in the First Baronial War only added further privileges to this charter. Among the territories lost by John Lackland, the most notable was the island of Ireland. After Richard the Lionheart's death, his nephew Arthur inherited the title of Duke of Ireland. However, with Arthur's murder by John Lackland in 1203 and the local great nobility's growing dissatisfaction with John's rule, they ultimately rose in rebellion in 1204, causing the Plantagenet dynasty to completely lose control over Ireland.\n\nEngland During the Time of 'Defender of Normandy' Henry III\n\nIn 1216 AD, King John died amidst shock and rebellion. His son, Henry III, was crowned the new king. However, the intervening French Dauphin Louis, alongside rebellious barons, defeated the Royal Army at the ancient battlefield of Hastings from a century prior. The young Henry III was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Kent, further expanding the power of local nobles. In the early years of Henry III's reign, the young king became a mere pawn manipulated by the earls, who gained far greater autonomy than their continental counterparts. Some even secretly formed factions to support his cousin, Eleanor of Brittany, in inheriting the throne. Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, reached a superficial reconciliation with the king, but underlying tensions between king and barons persisted, culminating in a complete rupture in 1258.\n\nThe year before, in 1257, Henry III led the Royal Guard to a successful victory over France at Rouen, reclaiming control of Normandy. Henry III then demanded the expansion of the standing army directly under royal command, but this required an additional allocation of funds and higher feudal dues. In the spring of 1258, when Henry III sought parliamentary funds to expand the standing army, English nobles led by the Earls of Norfolk, Gloucester, and Leicester demanded broader decentralization of power in exchange for the cash. The conflict between king and barons erupted completely, leading to the Third Baronial War.\n\nThe Third Baronial War ended with the Earl of Leicester's great victory at the Battle of Lewes and his subsequent march into London. Henry III, like his predecessor, was defeated by the angry lords. The Earls of Leicester and Norfolk were both elevated to dukes. Meanwhile, in northern England, the Scottish noble Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, led forces to occupy lands around his father's barony in Northumberland. The earl proclaimed, 'I am Earl of Angus in Scotland, and Earl of Northumberland in England.' Due to the defeat in the Baronial Wars, Henry III had little reach over Northumberland and could only acquiesce to its semi-independent status. In 1272, the 'Defender of Normandy,' Henry III, passed away at Westminster. His eldest son, Edward I, 'Longshanks' and 'Hammer of the Scots,' took up the royal scepter."

Before 1444, John was Richard's heir and remained loyal to his elder brother, managing the Norman territories efficiently and serving his brother diligently in the Anglo-French wars. However, in 1444, Richard fathered a daughter, Margaret, and designated her as his heir, causing John to lose his claim to the English throne. He has since harbored resentment.

EDG_ENG_flavorENG.3.d:0 "A single sprig of broom, blossoming into two roses.\n\nThe House of Anjou, hailing from France, journeyed five thousand kilometers to be crowned as kings in the holy city of the East. Surrounded by infidels, they fought with iron for a century; though afflicted with leprosy, they vowed never to surrender!\n\nThe House of Anjou, after conquering the British Isles, returned to the French continent to wage endless wars—there were the longbow volleys of England, the black legend of the Black Prince...\n\nAfter a century of turmoil, as the curtain fell, only two roses piercing the sky remained, scattering petals of red and white.\n\nThe House of Plantagenet, whose paternal lineage is the House of Anjou, was a noble family originating from Anjou, France. They ruled England from the 12th century onwards, with Henry II as the first King of England. Beyond their hereditary County of Anjou, this dynasty once ruled the Duchy of Normandy, the Kingdom of England, and the Duchy of Aquitaine, at one point possessing a vast dominion stretching from the Pyrenees to the Scottish border. Historians refer to the Kingdom of England of this era as the 'Angevin Empire.'\n\n'Plantagenet' was the nickname of Henry II's father, Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou. It is said Geoffrey wore a sprig of broom (planta genista) in his cap. Henceforth, 'Plantagenet' became synonymous with the Angevin House of Geoffrey.\n\nThe history of the 'Plantagenet' family is long, stirring, and epic. Generations of forebears shone like brilliant pearls, illuminating European history. As their successors, it is our duty to carry forward the glory of our ancestors, inherit their legacy, and once more pursue the path of the Plantagenet exemplars."

EDG_flavorENG_mission.28.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Council in London"
EDG_flavorENG_mission.28.d:0 "Recently, our monarch, [Root.Monarch.GetName], attended a council in London. At this council, [Root.Monarch.GetName], along with royal court advisors and counselors, engaged in prolonged debate with parliamentary representatives concerning the future political system of [Root.GetName].\n\nMany royal representatives firmly advocated for weakening parliamentary power, even abolishing Parliament entirely to achieve absolute monarchical rule. Among this faction were professors and scholars from Oxford, Cambridge, and Leicester Universities. They spoke eloquently and righteously, citing numerous historical examples from powerful nations on the European continent to argue that only complete monarchical absolutism could better implement and enforce policies, unifying the nation into a cohesive force. They believed that many continental powers focused on consolidating monarchical personal power and central government authority, viewing this as the path to national strength. Systems involving parliaments and republics, they argued, had demonstrated their failures in the Roman and Byzantine Empires. Their eloquent arguments captured the attention of many centrists within Parliament.\n\nHowever, when proponents of weakening and limiting royal power—the parliamentary faction—took the floor, their speeches were equally thunderous and thought-provoking. Without reaching far, they immediately cited the histories of John Lackland and Edward II 'the Inept' as evidence. When a monarch proved sufficiently incompetent or even cruel and tyrannical, to prevent the abuse of royal authority in committing unforgivable crimes against the homeland and people, and to avert dragging the entire nation and its populace into an abyss through personal will, the parliamentary faction had both the duty and the right to intervene and restrain the monarch.\n\nThe debate lasted a full day and night, intense discussions continuing from noon until midnight. Yet, from our monarch [Root.Monarch.GetName] down to non-voting, observer-status alternate members of Parliament, not a single person departed, for they knew this night would decide the future fate of [Root.GetName].\n\nIn the heat of their exchange, they forgot time and fatigue. Ultimately, the two factions reached a precious consensus: [Root.GetName] would embark on a new path, one of dual politics never before attempted. The monarch would share power with Parliament, retaining sufficient authority to enact any decision or command, but Parliament would reserve the power to 'reject' or 'delay' royal edicts. Should Parliament deem the monarch's personal actions likely to cause serious harm to the nation and people, it would immediately act, employing a series of rigorous and thorough voting procedures to decide whether to restrain that monarch's actions promptly. This effective policy would later be known as '[Root.GetName]'s Enlightened Monarchical Absolutism.'\n\nBy the council's end, the golden morning sun hung over the eastern horizon of London, its gentle light filling the entire parliamentary hall, akin to the smiles on the faces of the statues of previous kings lining the hall's sides. Led by [Root.Monarch.GetName], all members of the monarchy, court, and Parliament solemnly swore before God and the ancestors to forever safeguard the glory of [Root.GetName].\n\n[Root.GetName] is destined to rule the world!"

EDG_flavorENG_mission.29.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Council at Canterbury"
EDG_flavorENG_mission.29.d:0 "For a long time, numerous heretical sects have existed within [Root.GetName], including but not limited to Lollards, Waldensians, Insular Christians, and others. Although the situation improved significantly after resolving England's religious dilemma, [Root.GetName] still faces severe trials. Therefore, our monarch [Root.Monarch.GetName] specially journeyed to Canterbury, the residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Papal Patriarch for the British Isles and one of the major holy sites of Catholicism.\n\nAfter meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to convene a grand religious council at Canterbury, aiming to resolve [Root.GetName]'s domestic religious issues decisively. [Root.Monarch.GetName] believed that the significant ideological divisions in religion within [Root.GetName] not only greatly impacted Christian faith domestically but also hindered [Root.GetName]'s development in exchanges, trade, and other aspects with other European nations. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] resolved to address this issue through the Council of Canterbury.\n\nThe council invited representatives from various major sects within [Root.GetName], with Papal legates overseeing the proceedings. At the council, representatives engaged in fierce debates on how to handle heretical beliefs and integrate Christian faith in [Root.GetName]. Many radicals insisted on unwavering loyalty to the Roman Papacy, while moderates believed it unnecessary to change the state's mainstream faith, allowing the king to remain Catholic while continuing to expand legalized heretical communities among the populace. There were also absurd proposals suggesting [Root.Monarch.GetName] lead all of [Root.GetName] to convert to their religion—be it Waldensianism, Lollardy, or Insular Christianity.\n\nThe debate lasted a full day and night, intense discussions continuing from noon until midnight. Yet, from our monarch [Root.Monarch.GetName] down to non-speaking representatives of small parishes, not a single person departed, for they knew this night would decide the future fate of [Root.GetName].\n\nIn the heat of their exchange, they forgot time and fatigue. Ultimately, many factions reached a precious consensus: [Root.GetName] would embark on a new path, one never before attempted. This path was personally proposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. When he presented it, the entire assembly was astounded, but after a full night of intense debate, everyone realized this plan seemed the most acceptable. On one hand, it was not as radically extreme and fanatically opposed to Catholic authority as other heresies; on the other, it was not as exclusively intolerant of various heretical sects as the Roman Papacy.\n\nBy the council's end, the golden morning sun hung over the eastern horizon of London, its gentle light filling the entire parliamentary hall, akin to the smiles on the faces of the statues of previous kings lining the hall's sides. Led by [Root.Monarch.GetName], all members of the monarchy, the Roman Papacy, and the various heretical sects solemnly swore before God and the ancestors to forever safeguard the glory of [Root.GetName].\n\n[Root.GetName] is destined to rule the world!"

EDG_flavorENG_mission.30.d:0 "For a long time, various pioneering forms of religious reform, such as Lollardy, Waldensianism, Catharism, and others, have dramatically altered the religious landscape of Europe. In this era of faith-based chaos, [Root.GetName] must declare its firm religious stance. This will, of course, spark much debate at court, with some favoring the new teachings while others defend the old.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, loyal to the Crown, has proposed a novel idea to our monarch, [Root.Monarch.GetName]: establish a distinct church. This church would have the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its supreme head, forming a blessed alliance between church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would adopt a flexible approach to doctrine to adapt to different circumstances.\n\nSuch a church has its advantages. No longer subject to any supreme religious authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry or divorce at will, determine the nation's theological direction, and affirm that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule is directly mandated by God."
