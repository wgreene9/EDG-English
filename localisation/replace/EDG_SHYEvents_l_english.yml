He has given unto us all lands between sunrise and sunset.\n\nGod has decreed that in Heaven there is only one eternal God and on Earth there is also only one ruler, Genghis Khan, Temüjin, Son of Tengri... If, according to Tengri's will, the world from the lands of sunrise to sunset may enjoy peace and joy, then our desire is fulfilled...\n\nIt is known to all that we are the army of God. God created us as the product of His wrath and dispatched us upon those peoples who incurred His anger... We know you are destroyers, doing evil deeds. Therefore, Tengri sent us to deal with you.\n\nIf you, insignificant one, still wish to retain your lands, waters, and possessions, you must come before us in person, draw near, and submit to the Khan who holds sway over the entire world.\n\nThis is the command of the Eternal God, not of mortal men... Therefore, we convey Tengri's command to you in writing through your priests, messengers, and nobles. Our agreement with you is Tengri's will. If you hear and believe, and wish to obey us, then send envoys to us. Then we shall understand whether you desire war or peace with us.\n\nIf you do not obey the decree, we know not what will happen; God knows."

EDG_SHYEvents.2.desc:0 "If the Pax Romana was a peace under civilization, then the Pax Mongolica can only be called a peace under barbarism, and the Özbeg Khanate is its finest exemplar.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Golden Horde, the Jochid Ulus, the 16-year-old Abu'l-Khayr Khan traveled east against the path of his ancestors' conquests and was acclaimed as the Great Khan of the Özbegs. This vast empire stretching from the eastern foothills of the Ural Mountains to the wealthy region of Transoxiana could be considered a miniature version of Genghis Khan's empire. The Great Khan ruled over subjects from all corners speaking diverse tongues, profiting by exploiting conflicts and covert struggles between different faiths or tribes, thereby managing a vast populace with minimal governance costs, needing only to issue direct orders to close advisors.\n\nNow, the Özbeg Khanate is in its ascendancy. To the south, the Timurid Empire, though long fragmented, still controls the fertile Ferghana Valley and the key Central Asian city of Samarkand. Over the past decade, both sides have engaged in constant raids and minor clashes in Transoxiana. The balance of power currently maintains a delicate equilibrium, but it is foreseeable that after the death of the aged Shah Rukh, the Timurid Empire will crumble. Then, the balance of power will be completely shattered, and all Abu'l-Khayr Khan needs to do is wait. To the east, the Chagatai Khanate, nominally still under the protection of the Yuan Dynasty, ceaselessly threatens the khanate's eastern borders, and the ensuing flames of war will also ignite the banks of the Chu River. To the west lies the legacy of the former Golden Horde. The tenth Khan of the Golden Horde, Tinibeg, was killed by his brother Janibeg, who in turn was poisoned by his son Berdibeg, followed by his two younger brothers successively following the same pattern. The Golden Horde descended into its first great turmoil. Since then, such history has been commonplace; Khans' reigns have been shorter than the time it takes to fatten the livestock they keep. To this day, they are still engaged in endless quarrels and attacks...\n\nBut this does not mean the Özbeg Khanate can act recklessly. Ruling such vast tribes is no easy task—the Nogai tribes in the west are already restless, and the Kazakh tribes in the east are ambivalent. Once the Özbeg Khanate halts its conquests, rebellion and secession will follow. No one knows what will become of the Özbeg Khanate after Abu'l-Khayr Khan's death; even he himself does not know where the khanate will go in the future.\n\nReligious and tribal conflicts perpetually loom over the khanate. Every person who ascends to the Khan's throne must prove that he and his descendants are the undisputed Great Khan—by any means necessary, whether through divine mandate or massacre. Peace has never been the khanate's main theme. War drums beat, hooves fall like rain. Every Great Khan will emulate their ancestor of ancestors, the great world-conqueror Genghis Khan, setting out from the steppe to conquer the world, then taking root within, truly ruling the world...\n\nShattered empires, chaotic politics, corrupt bureaucrats—all have paved the way for the Özbeg Khanate's expansion. And Abu'l-Khayr Khan will lead the khanate toward a more distant future, just like the ancestors of old. The descendants of Shayban have no more time to waste. Making the earth's edges hear the warhorses' neighs and the melodic sounds of the morin khuur is the innate mission of the nomads—"

In the early game, no nation can stand in the way of your expansion.\n\nHowever, nomadic regimes are subject to a collapse disaster. Do not allow this disaster to trigger. Typically, this disaster can trigger very quickly when development is high, but the unique Shaybanid Uzbek mechanic, 'The Great Expedition,' can significantly delay its progress. Additionally, completing certain specific missions can also reduce the disaster's progress.\n\nThe aforementioned methods only delay the disaster's progress and do not address the root cause. Therefore, it is essential to complete the mission '§YAdopt Feudal Institutions§!' as soon as possible to disable this disaster.\n\nThe Shaybanid Uzbeks have an extensive mission tree for world conquest, divided into four expansion paths. Each path begins with the special mechanic 'The Great Expedition.' Extend this modifier through missions and complete the final objective before the modifier expires to end the expedition and receive the final reward.

# The torrent of history surges forward; all streams, great and small, converge into the abyss.\n\nFrom its opening in 1444 to now, centuries have passed for the Özbegs, yet the history preceding remains vivid: After the death of Fernando III, the Christian kingdoms ultimately failed to unite, the Reconquista stalled, and Iberia remains fragmented to this day. The Golden Horde disintegrated, the Black Sea steppes were carved up by packs of wolves, and Orthodox Christians reclaimed the lands of the great steppe. Kievan Rus' gained freedom from the Mongols, but internal contradictions grew acute; civil war in Kievan Rus' is imminent, and this land will surely be engulfed in flames of war.
