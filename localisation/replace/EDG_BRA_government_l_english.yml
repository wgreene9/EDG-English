EDG_BRA_Territory:0 "Hohenzollern Family Territory"
EDG_BRA_Territory_desc:0 "The House of Hohenzollern originated near Hechingen in the Duchy of Swabia. Its progenitor, Burkhard I, was granted the County of Zollern in the early 11th century. The ancestral lands were once between the upper Neckar River, the Swabian Jura, and the upper Danube. The House of Zollern was a loyal supporter of the Holy Roman Empire. Later, the prefix 'Hohen' was added before Zollern, becoming the House of Hohenzollern. Over centuries, through repeated struggles with local nobility, the Hohenzollerns developed powerful control over regional nobles, ensuring their authority was unquestioned. Consequently, the Hohenzollerns gained superior ability in managing the nobility."

EDG_BRA_Markgraf:0 "Hohenzollern Frontier Margraviate"
EDG_BRA_Markgraf_desc:0 "The House of Hohenzollern operated in Franconia and Swabia for centuries with limited success. The family regained prominence due to the formidable reputation earned through blood and fire in the northern crucible. In 1440, the Hohenzollerns lost the Franconian succession crisis. Drawing on family experience in the eastern Polish lands and reflecting on the past, they ultimately grasped the truth: 'Might stems from the edge of the sword.' The Hohenzollerns completely abandoned immersion in diplomatic maneuvering, resolving to defend their rights and interests by force. With extraordinary ability to manage the nobility and the tempering of blood and fire, the Hohenzollerns returned to the stage."
