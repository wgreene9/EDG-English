However, in the 'Entrance to the Desolate Ground' mod, the author has personally realized this dream for them, crafting a legend with their own hands. You might wonder, what is the point of creating a heap of utterly implausible plots and stories for such historical marginalia? But history is composed of the superposition of numerous factors; the rise and fall of order is merely a combination of various points and surfaces. Transforming insignificant figures into great empires — is this not also part of the charm of history?"

EDG_DMR_flavor.2.t:0 "The Story of Turov"
EDG_DMR_flavor.2.d:0 "Since the 13th century, groups of wanderers making a living through song and dance performances have appeared on the European continent. They had no fixed homes, drifting from village to town. Their animal-drawn caravans served as both their means of transport and their dwelling places. After many wanderings, they became the later world-famous Gypsies. One group arrived in Eastern Europe. Their presence could be found in regions such as Polotsk, Turov, and Minsk. However, in the eyes of the rulers, they were distinctly different from ordinary residents. Their modes of production, lifestyle, and the various occupations they undertook were not what ordinary, settled residents should do; on this land, they were the most obvious destabilizing factor. The situation in Turov was particularly severe. A large number of Gypsies flooded into this swampy region. Through 'enthusiastic physical exchanges' with the peasants and experiences of both overt and covert struggles with the city dwellers, they successfully won the attention of Prince Alexander of Turov. After deep contemplation, the Prince resolved to utilize all this about the Gypsies to divide the common people and incite strife among them. Thus, he allocated spaces for these Gypsies to build shantytowns in various city streets and park their caravans, even disguising them as so-called 'Cossack Militias' to suppress the populace. However, because their numbers were far lower than those of the ordinary people, they faced long-term oppression and discrimination in daily life. More importantly, Prince Alexander of Turov himself and the noble class he represented also looked down upon these dirty Gypsies who had no proper jobs. The Gypsies lived for many years under this high-pressure squeeze from both sides. But with the resumption of civil war in Kiev and the fragmentation of the Rus' region, the Eastern European subcontinent entered a state of vibrant vitality and burgeoning growth. In such an extraordinary era, these Gypsies too might stir up a particularly unique storm of bloodshed."

EDG_DMR_flavor.3.d:0 "The Gypsies took root and multiplied in the Minsk region of Eastern Europe, with many centuries passing in the long flow of time. Within the city of Pinsk, their presence was especially dense. Yet, their living environment was worlds apart from that of the ordinary people. Surrounding the city walls were low, cramped shantytowns, where people were packed tightly together, resembling a bowl of porridge so thick it couldn't be stirred, struggling to survive within.\nHowever, it was within such a crowded and chaotic environment that a shining 'grain of wheat' was nurtured — Yanorò Fátyol. Naturally intelligent, he displayed extraordinary leadership from a young age and was the undisputed king of the children. Wherever he appeared, a large crowd would spontaneously gather behind him, be they Gypsies or other ethnicities, all following closely and working together towards a common goal. The noise from their playful antics was often astonishingly loud, infuriating their neighbor, Peter Razi — a somewhat serious young man. Yet, miraculously, though Peter was enraged each time, for various complex reasons, he ultimately chose tolerance again and again, letting these mischievous friends off.\nBack then, none of them knew how long such a life would last. In the uneventful days, time quietly passed, and the gears of fate turned imperceptibly. Perhaps, when the tide of time pushed them to that pivotal moment that would change everything, what would be utterly reshaped was not just this familiar world, but also the trajectories of their own lives."

EDG_DMR_flavor.4.d:0 "On that heavy winter day, as the Prince of Turov was traveling by carriage, a beggar clad in Gypsy attire approached him, trembling and unsteady. What followed was a tearful lament about the discrimination he suffered and the immense pressure of taxes. However, the Prince's attendants and coachman did not halt the carriage; instead, they drove straight on, the horse hooves and wheels slowly advancing forward, as if expressing an indifferent sentiment. Then came heart-rending cries and wails. Those living in high buildings watched this scene with indifference, while the shanty-dwelling commoners below feigned sympathy, unsure whether to conceal high-level anger or revel in the secret glee that the injured was not themselves. Only one youth stood nearby, expressionless, yet with a raging fire of anger burning in his eyes. The splendid carriage versus ragged clothing, the tall horses versus short commoners, the glorious crown versus the dirty hat — how glaring the contrast. The youth turned away, still pondering this scene in his heart. Then he growled softly: 'I, Yanorò Fátyol, as a man, should save my own people and then sit upon that supreme seat.' No one knew if he spoke the truth or was merely boasting. Perhaps, given time, all this would eventually come to pass.\nThat night, heavy snow fell, yet someone's heart burned like a blazing fire"

EDG_DMR_flavor.5.d:0 "The winter of 1445 was more biting than ever before. The shantytowns outside Turov's walls were encrusted with icicles, like countless inverted daggers. Yanorò squatted in a drafty shack, rubbing a found horseshoe with frozen fingers—a fragment that had flown off when the Prince's carriage crushed the old beggar. Rust mixed with bloodstains spread dark-red patterns in his palm.\n'They dare to double the hearth tax!' limped the blacksmith Vasily as he lifted the straw curtain, a half-sack of stolen charcoal hidden on his shoulder. 'Brothers from the mines say the Prince's fireplace burns human tallow!'\nYanorò pressed the horseshoe onto the frozen ground, rising with a gust of cold wind: 'Tonight, gather all men who can walk at the old mill.'\nMeanwhile, beneath the ruins of the mill, more than thirty shadows huddled in the darkness. When Yanorò arrived, he drew diagrams on the broken wall with a charcoal stick: the drainage channels of the Prince's castle, the guard change times at the granary, the structure of the iron lock on the stable's back door. 'They crush our bones with taxes,' he crushed the charcoal stick, 'so we'll burn through their fortress using their own rules.'\nThe lame youth Michy raised a half-rusted spear: 'But we don't even have decent weapons!'\nYanorò poured out the charcoal from Vasily's sack and tore off his own tattered cloak: 'Know why the Prince fears fire? Because his stone castle is stuffed with wool tapestries and oak barrels.'\nLater, on a blizzard night, a line of shadows crept along the base of the city wall. Yanorò himself carried oil-soaked felt, followed by women and children holding clay jars. While the castle garrison gambled with dice around the fireplace, Vasily used a blacksmith's hook to pry open the drainage grate.\n'Pour!' Yanorò's low command was drowned by the wind and snow. The women poured honey from the clay jars over the iron grate—their last reserves saved from the beekeepers. The honey congealed in the cold, freezing the grate and wall into one solid mass.\nIn the darkest hour before dawn, Yanorò lit the oil-soaked felt and stuffed it into the drain. Flames licked up the castle's outer wall along the honey coating, turning wool tapestries into curtains of fire in an instant. As the Prince's screams echoed from the tower, the rebels drew a giant wheel in the snow with charcoal ash..." # lame youth Misha?

It seemed he, having leapt from the bottom to the top, hadn't fully adapted yet.\n'You still have the mind to admire the scenery.' Peter Razi said in a tone between amusement and something else, perhaps expressing dissatisfaction or simply finding it strange. Yanorò didn't answer, merely taking a map rolled on parchment from his bosom and gently spreading it on the table.\nJust as Peter was puzzled, Yanorò softly spoke: 'You and I have known each other for nearly a decade. You are my elder, one of the people I respect most. But it seems you still don't understand who I am.' Then he suddenly drew a short sword from his side and stabbed it forcefully into several spots on the map.\nPeter froze instantly, trembling as he asked, 'Yanorò… what is this?'\n'You should call me the Absolute Paramount King now.' Yanorò smiled.\nPeter fell silent, walking forward to look at the map. He found several places deeply pierced. It was a vast world map. The marks accurately hit various important cities across the globe. Nearby were Moscow, Vienna, Constantinople, Paris, London. Farther were Cairo, Isfahan. Even a large blank area on the map. Peter's face was full of confusion, about to raise a hand to press his forehead. Yanorò seemed to see through this and gently swatted his hand away. 'I'm not sick, I just want to tell you one thing.'\n'What… are you trying to express by this?' Peter asked. Yanorò closed his eyes first, then lifted his head and proclaimed loudly: 'Our history of being bullied has been too long, our history of being discriminated against has been too long, our history of being seen as an incapable people has been too long. And today, I will lead my people from victory to victory. I will be the Tsar of Moscow, and also the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire; I will be the Basileus of the Roman Empire, and also the Co-King of the Paris region; I will be the Chakravartin of India, and also the Shahanshah of Iran; I will be the Padishah of Turkey, and also the Malik of Arabia… and may even be the Son of Heaven of that distant land.' After the impassioned words came long streams of tears, as if trying to cry out all the suffering ever endured.\nPeter, infected by this atmosphere, also sighed with resounding force…"

EDG_DMR_flavor.7.d:0 "Alfie tore open his cloak scorched by Greek fire, the bronze wheel on his banner gleaming coldly under the moonlight. Three breaches had already been torn in the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, but the battlements still poured down scalding pitch—the Greeks had turned the entire city into a furnace. 'Let our brethren follow me!' As the ruler waved his hand, three hundred grey-robed clerics carrying a wooden altar charged towards the moat. These heretical Gypsy believers sang dualistic psalms, erecting siege ladders soaked in olive oil amidst the rain of arrows. The defenders watched in horror as flames licked up their beards without harming their skin in the slightest.\nSuddenly, horns sounded from the direction of the Golden Horn. Alfie's general, Karlo, had broken through the chain barrier with his fleet; twenty modified Venetian merchant ships were loaded with Domria's heavy cavalry. Their hooves, wrapped in felt, trod upon the slippery decks, landing in the harbor district even before their navy.\n'Heretics are in the city!' Mikhail the fishmonger from the market district was the first to sound the alarm. Silk merchants piled their stock into barricades, dousing Eastern fabrics embroidered with golden thread in wine and setting them ablaze. Sophia, a fourteen-year-old scripture scribe, was running through the streets with church silverware when a stray arrow pierced her left calf. Gritting her teeth, she thrust the chalice into the hands of a passing blacksmith: 'At least don't let the holy relics fall beneath the Wheel Banner!' When Alfie personally forced open the Golden Gate, his boots were already caked with minced flesh and glazed tiles. His scimitar cleaved into the shoulder blade of a purple-clad noble who, with his dying breath, cursed in Latin: 'Devil of the Bogomils...' The ruler kicked the corpse aside, suddenly noticing that the man's family crest bore a startling resemblance to the wheel pattern on his own banner.\nThe true hard nut to crack was the Hippodrome. Five thousand citizens brandishing kitchen knives and pitchforks desperately held the passages, behind them the last three hundred Varangian Guards and mercenaries from Genoa. Alfie's vanguard cavalry had just charged through the archway when ropes tripped them; women hidden in the stands frantically hurled stone jars of pickled olives—these were Constantinople's last condiments, and their final ammunition.\n'Hold!' Alfie suddenly shouted, stopping the crossbowmen ready to loose fire arrows. He noticed a white-haired old woman sitting in a pool of blood, holding an infant whose swaddling clothes were embroidered with the double-circle cross of the Bogomil sect. The old woman tremblingly said in Greek: 'This child's mother was a Gypsy girl from Thrace... Great Paramount King, please spare her!' Whether out of pity or something else, Alfie turned away, no longer looking at the old woman, and hurried towards the Hippodrome.\nThe stalemate at the Hippodrome was broken by tsunami-like cheers. Karlo's cavalry emerged from the underground canals, their hooves trampling the mosaic tiles laid during the time of Emperor Justinian. Seizing the opportunity, Alfie led his personal guard in a charge towards the Hagia Sophia, only to be stopped at the entrance by a blind archbishop. 'Your wheels cannot crush the true faith.' The bishop raised a notched sacramental knife. Alfie, however, unbuckled his sword and plunged it into the ground, revealing the double-circle cross embroidery on his inner collar: 'We believe in Christ as you do, only in our own way.' That night, Alfie stood beneath the dome of the great cathedral, counting the spoils. He deliberately spared twelve icons of the Virgin but tore down all mosaics depicting icon veneration—the Bogomil tradition of opposing idolatry could not be compromised. Army artisans began spray-painting the national flag onto the mottled walls, resembling flowing flames in the candlelight.\n'Your Majesty, the Paramount King, the citizens are burning their own houses.' Adjutant Ivan Razi (Peter's nephew) presented blood-stained intelligence. Alfie walked to the edge of the balcony and saw seven pillars of fire rising from the slums, the stench of burning mingling with the prayers of the dying. He gripped the bronze wheel decoration on the railing so tightly that the embossed pattern cut into his palm, drawing blood. At dawn, Alfie rode a white horse, surveying the devastated streets. Surviving Byzantine nobles were chained behind the triumphant procession; among them, a noblewoman wearing a golden headscarf suddenly spat at him. The ruler laughed heartily, unfastening the Wheel Banner and draping it over her: 'Remember, from today, you too are one of the spokes turning Domria!'\nIn the dock district, Ivan Razi was supervising the burning of Latin texts. Alfie suddenly snatched a copy of the 'Iliad' and threw it into the sea: 'Keep a few ships to transport scholars and artisans, especially those who know how to make Greek fire.' He gazed at the morning mist over the Sea of Marmara, where the silhouettes of Venetian warships were faintly gathering in the distance.\nThe revelry lasted until noon on the seventh day. When Alfie was crowned 'Basileus of Rome and Domria' in the Hippodrome, the surviving citizens watched in horror as the Wheel Banners planted all over the walls began to turn in the wind—the bronze bearings on the tricolor banners were actually functional mechanisms that could truly rotate.\nSophia, hiding in the crypt of St. Mary's Church, peeked at the ceremony through a crack. She saw that demon who had slain the purple-clad noble, now kneeling before a Bogomil altar, kissing the earth. Sunlight streamed through the shattered stained glass onto his back, and the shadow cast by his banner enveloped not only all Constantinople, but the entire reborn Roman Empire."

EDG_DMR_flavor.8.d:0 "Alfie spat out the grit in his mouth; the Wheel Banner snapped in the gunpowder smoke of Kostantiniyye. Across the strait, the Janissaries were reloading their mortars—those bronze barrels engraved with crescent moons had, just three hours prior, shattered the Christian churches of the Golden Horn.\n'Let the heretics witness true fire!' The Ottoman commander Ali waved his scimitar, and two hundred Janissaries suddenly emerged from underground water channels. These warriors, crowned with white plumes and slathered in olive oil, breached the Bogomil firewalls and stormed the base of the siege towers. Alfie watched as his cousin was cleaved, losing half his skull, his blood-soaked turban floating down onto the stone bridge built by Suleiman the Magnificent.\nAs the call to prayer echoed from the minarets of the mosques, Domria's sappers finally blew open the Edirne Gate. Just as Alfie's scimitar severed the iron portcullis chains, he crashed into thirty butchers' apprentices brandishing cleavers—behind them, the tanners' guild was pouring pitch onto the streets.\n'The wheels of infidels cannot crush the city of Allah!' The one-eyed blacksmith Ibrahim swung a red-hot iron chain, instantly setting ablaze the deerskin armor of three Romani infantrymen. Alfie's warhorse was splashed with boiling pitch on its belly; the frenzied beast carried him crashing into the spice bazaar, where clouds of cinnamon and saffron dust choked vision.\nWhen the Sultan's personal cavalry charged down the hillside, Alfie was pinned beneath collapsed market stalls. Fifteen-year-old Jewish apothecary apprentice David suddenly rushed out from a cellar, hurling an entire jar of serpent venom powder at the pursuing soldiers. Maddened horses carrying cavalry crashed into a copperware shop, and two thousand mosque lanterns simultaneously exploded into green fireballs.\n'Why help us?' Alfie used the dagger from his father to cut through the beam pinning his leg. David snatched up a turmeric-stained parchment scroll and fled: 'My father was burned as a heretic, on a torture wheel bearing the very same pattern as your banner!'\nThe true brutal struggle erupted in the Grand Bazaar. Five hundred merchants bound Bogomil monks with silk and poured ground pepper into their grey robes. Alfie's deputy, Karlo, choked and wept from the spice fumes, yet still commanded his crossbowmen to shoot at the skylights—falling chandeliers ignited stockpiled wool, turning the entire market district into an inferno.\nAlfie led his personal guard to the front of the Hagia Sophia, only to find it had been converted into the Ayasofya Mosque. Arrows shot from the minarets embedded themselves in the Wheel Banner, and the rotating bronze bearings on the banner actually jammed the arrow shafts. 'Allahu Akbar!' Ten turbaned dervishes carrying powder kegs charged from a side door; Alfie's captain of the guard immediately threw himself upon the fuses.\nWhen Alfie kicked open the prayer hall doors, blood was flowing over the carved Quranic inscriptions. Eighty-year-old Imam Ibrahim propped himself up with a broken sword: 'You wheel-worshipping heretics...' Before he could finish, Alfie suddenly tore open his collar, revealing a brand—the double-circle cross of the Bogomils, identical to the pattern on the mosque floor tiles. 'When you burned my ancestors, you didn't distinguish between sects.' Alfie severed the chandelier chains; the added Islamic adornments crashed down, revealing the Byzantine-era mosaic of the Virgin Mary. Surviving Romani craftsmen immediately climbed the scaffolding, covering the Arabic motifs with three-colored pigments.\nAs night fell, Alfie stood atop the Galata Tower overlooking the city. Seven granaries were ablaze, yet the Sultan's troops still controlled the strait's artillery batteries. His general Karlo, covered in burns, reported: 'Greek fishermen are willing to ferry our troops with their boats, on condition the ancient Patriarchate is restored.' A sudden explosion shattered the glass windows. Alfie rushed to the balcony and saw surviving Ottoman warships ramming the transport vessels. Amidst the cries of drowning soldiers, he noticed David's parchment scroll floating from a sinking ship—the boy was clinging desperately to a mast, clutching a torn fragment of the Wheel Banner.\n'Dispatch the assault boats!' Alfie tore off his cloak and threw it to the messenger: 'Tell all unbelievers: Domria's wheels can crush chains, and they can also bear any faith!' In the darkest hour before dawn, Alfie led three hundred warriors in a raid on the strait's batteries. They wrapped the cannon barrels in wine-soaked blankets, and the flame prayers of the Bogomil monks caused the bronze cannons to explode on the spot. When the first rays of sunlight illuminated the dome of Hagia Sophia, the tricolor Wheel Banner was finally planted atop the mast of the Ottoman flagship.\nSeven days later, Alfie held his coronation in the Hippodrome. Surviving Janissaries were chained below the viewing stands, their red caps scattered across the ground. As the ruler raised his scepter encrusted with trophies, the surviving citizens watched in terror—the Wheel Banners planted throughout the city were rotating in sync with the sea breeze, as if an invisible giant hand were turning the fate of the entire empire. David, hiding in a spice cellar, secretly observed the ceremony. He saw Alfie personally tie the Imam's turban around the scepter, while Bogomil monks chanted dualistic psalms in Arabic. The youth felt the vial of snake venom in his pocket and suddenly thought that the spinning wheel on the banner might truly carve out a different path. But where would that path lead?"

EDG_DMR_flavor.9.d:0 "As the Romani's colorful wheeled chariots crushed the ruins of the Golden Horn, the power map of the entire Christian world began to crack. The Roman Curia defined the fall of Constantinople as a 'Second Babylonian Captivity,' yet secretly sold indulgences to rebuild crusader funds; diplomatic dispatches between Paris and the East intertwined like spiderwebs, with France, styling itself as the 'Guardian of Civilization,' supplying arms to Domria while quietly pushing the Rhine defenses thirty miles eastward.\n\nThe lamentations of Orthodox Patriarchs became ammunition for Protestant princes—preachers of the Prayer faction declared in Wittenberg that 'a fluid heresy is more dangerous than a solidified Sultan,' while the Cathars seized the chance to promote their doctrine: since God allowed the Romani to win, why not spread asceticism across all of Europe?\n\nThe true fissure lay in the reconstruction of the sacred order. Domria converted the dome of Hagia Sophia into an observatory, the cross and the double-circle cross casting entangled shadows under moonlight. The Iberians discovered that Andalusian Romani craftsmen were using movable type from the Bible to print tarot cards, the back of every 'Death' card bearing the latitude and longitude of Constantinople.\n\nWhen Alfie's envoy presented the enameled wheel inlaid with the Virgin's tears to the Curia, the Cardinals suddenly realized—this plague was not a conquest, but a murder of the very concept of eternity."

Solemn expressions were etched on every face, a calm before the storm. Ordinarily, they were reluctant to raise armies against heretical incursions, but when those heretics were Romani and their power vast, they felt a profound fear.\n\n'In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit!' The Pope's staff struck the altar, shaking loose a shower of gold dust. 'The cancerous tumor entrenched in Constantinople dares to crush Christ's icons with heretical wheels! They smash icons of the Virgin, replacing them with astrological charts, destroy devout paintings for tarot card sigils—this is not conquest, it is usurpation of God's throne!' The cardinals lifted twelve bloodstained shrouds, bearing the scorch marks of Romani troops burning monasteries.\n\n'Behold!' The Pope tore open a shroud, revealing the rusted remains of a cross beneath. 'Even the soil of the Great Plains weeps! The Domrians cart away saints' bones in their caravans, melt down Gospels to forge wheel bearings! Today, if we do not raise our swords, tomorrow their Wheel Banner will fly upon the walls of Rome!'\n\nThe crowd's breathing grew heavy. The Venetian ambassador's quill snapped on the parchment, the Genoese banker tore his pearl necklace, gold coins raining through his fingers. 'All who join this holy war,' the Pope's voice thundered through the silence, 'shall receive full absolution! Those who fall shall ascend to Heaven! Whoever seizes a piece of heretic land may build a City of Christ upon it, forever exempt from tithes!' Those below also began to shout:"

The glow from forges reddened the Tiber, peasant women donated dowry silver to be melted for sword hilts, children anointed shields with holy oil. Florentine painters were hired to depict 'St. Michael Trampling the Wheel Banner' on knights' breastplates; German mercenaries tore down colorful silks left by Romani caravans, piling them in the square to burn, and from the ashes emerged the face of the Virgin—the crowd immediately knelt, hailing it a miracle.\n\nThe greatest frenzy was on the eastern border of Hungary. Peasants hacked apart wandering caravans with scythes, nailing any tarot cards found to church doors. The back of every 'Death' card bore the scrawled name of a local lord—this coincidence sparked greater panic, and three counts were hanged by the mob without trial.

The initial, seemingly unstoppable advance proved a mere mirage—when Burgundian heavy cavalry charged into the Transylvanian valleys, the Romani had long turned the villages into ghost towns, their granaries stuffed with wine-soaked straw that left the crusader horses stumbling drunk upon the frozen riverbanks after feeding. Hungarian light cavalry pursued the colorful banners of caravans deep into the Carpathian Mountains, only to discover in a blizzard that those 'battle standards' were but dead branches tied with bronze bells; the true rebel army was carving paths into cliffs with ice picks, their felt-wrapped boots silently circling behind the allied forces.\n\nThe most fatal blow came from the Papal Legate himself. Inside the gilded Bible of the Cardinal was tucked a handwritten note from a Romani fortune-teller. When he suddenly convulsed and fell at the Diet of Regensburg, half a poisoned 'Hanged Man' tarot card was found clutched in his hand. Its back bore a scrawled Latin phrase: 'What you call a Crusade is but a speck of dust on the Wheel of Fortune.'\n\nThe crushing defeat suffered by the French knights along the Vistula River became the turning point. Those nobles cloaked in fleur-de-lis believed they had routed the main force of the wanderers, only to discover while scavenging the battlefield that the 'corpses' were but crude burlap dolls stuffed with rotten straw—the true Romani warriors had long retreated via underground river networks, leaving only resin-soaked fuses behind. That night, thousands of lotus lanterns suddenly drifted down the river. German infantry, mistaking them for signals of surrender, rushed to retrieve them, unaware the wicks were connected to reed pipes soaked in fire oil. The moment the light illuminated the banks, archers hidden in willow groves loosed volleys of fire arrows, turning the entire river into a burning furnace. Chainmail melted like hot syrup over soldiers' bodies in the intense heat. When surviving Swiss pikemen fled back to camp, they found their supply wagons replaced by caravans laden with mirrors. The midday sun, refracted by the mirrors, ignited the Pope-blessed battle flags. Amidst the thick smoke, Romani performers stood on the hillside playing lyres, twisting the 'Kyrie Eleison' into a mocking variation.\n\nDeadly fractures tore the crusader coalition apart from within. Venetian merchant fleets halted supplies under the pretext of storms, while secretly selling crossbow parts to Domria. Spanish tercio infantry mutinied over unpaid wages, tearing the Habsburg double-headed eagle banner into bandages. Even the devout Hospitaller Knights were split, with some discovered using holy oil to treat Romani wounded in field hospitals.\n\nBy the time Andre's chariot appeared at the Alpine pass, the last alliance nobles were arguing over who to blame in the cellars of Eagle Castle, unaware that the wine cellars beneath them had been tunneled through by Romani sappers. Three hundred barrels of aged vintage, mixed with gunpowder, blasted seven centuries of family glory into bone fragments embedded in the stone walls.\n\nWhen the Pope received the battle report in the Vatican, the golden cross in his hand fell precisely upon the Book of Revelation. Outside his window, Roman citizens had lost interest in the Crusade's outcome, caring more for the cheap Eastern spices brought by Romani caravans—those wagons laden with cinnamon and pepper were parked right in St. Peter's Square. Their axles bore newly minted copper coins: on the obverse, the Bogomil double-circle cross; on the reverse, an ancient Romani proverb:"

EDG_DMR_flavor.13.d:0 "When Yanorò's chariot crushed the thin snow on the Carpathian foothills, a sea of starlight suddenly rose on the distant horizon. Scouts reported it as a wandering caravan, but the ruler sensed something amiss—the sound of bells and drums in the wind was identical to what he had heard on the Moldavian steppes in his youth. 'Halt!' He raised his hand to stop the army and rode alone up the high slope. Under the moonlight, hundreds of large wagons covered with colorful silk formed a circular camp, bronze bells engraved with the Bogomil double-circle cross hanging from their axles. An elder by the campfire was playing the 'Epic of Migration' on a gut-stringed lute, the melody making Yanorò suddenly tighten his grip on the reins—this was the war song of the Western Romani clans, lost for a century.\n\n'Are you... the Star Speakers of Turov?' His voice trembled. The music ceased abruptly. The elder stood, his cloak slipping to reveal a wheel-shaped brand on his shoulder. 'And you,' the elder's pupils contracted, 'are that madman from the east who calls himself the "Driver"?' Yanorò's lieutenants drew their swords, but were stopped by the ruler's command. He dismounted, tearing open his breastplate to reveal an identical brand: 'My grandfather once told me, during the great plague centuries ago, our ancestors parted ways at this mountain—you went west seeking the stars, we went east chasing the sun.' The camp erupted. An old woman brought out a faded genealogy, the ink tracing the two branches on the parchment now blurred and indistinct.\n\nBy dawn, the two armies' camps had merged into one. Dancers from Provence taught Eastern European warriors the Flamenco; Burgundian fortune-tellers used wine dregs to read the stars for Domrian soldiers. Yanorò's astrologer suddenly cried out—in the morning mist, the wheel ruts left on the ground by the eastern and western caravans combined to form a complete Tarot 'World' card pattern. 'This is no coincidence,' the Wallachian elder drove his staff into the intersection of the ruts. 'When we parted, the seer said that when the ruts reunite as the "World," the Romani shall wander no more.' Yanorò grabbed a handful of snow mixed with soil from east and west, watching it melt into a trickling stream in his palm: 'Then let this snowmelt fill the Elbe! From Ireland to the Urals, all wheels must turn in the same direction!'\n\nSeven days later, when the combined forces reached the banks of the Vistula, an even more astonishing scene occurred: thousands of bronze wheels surfaced from the river, covenant tokens sunk into the waters a century ago when the Romani clans dispersed. Yanorò and the Western chieftain each took a hammer, melting the old and new wheels into a colossus—its base the castle of settlers, its pinnacle the astrolabe of wanderers, and the pillar connecting them engraved with the migration routes of all clans. 'From this day forward,' Yanorò raised the blood-stained Wheel Banner beneath the colossus, 'our camp is our capital, and our capital is our camp!' Two hundred thousand Romani used lyres instead of war drums, transforming the 'Epic of Migration' into a unified anthem.\n\nThat night, fortune-tellers raked twenty-two intact Major Arcana cards from the campfire ashes. The figures on each card held implements blending East and West—the spokes of the 'Chariot' were engraved with both the sun and the stars. These two celestial bodies, seemingly never meeting, yet inseparable in truth, had finally returned to their origin."

EDG_DMR_flavor.14.d:0 "Fifty years of human life are like a dream, an illusion. Is wealth and honor but the smoke and clouds beside us, or a tangible phantom? Is the realm but the fertile soil beneath our feet, or a mirage in the mist? Yanorò now stands atop the palace specially built for him in Pinsk, overlooking the bustling crowd below. Over the past decades, he had been like a shooting star, illuminating his people's hopes. He had been like a beam of light, shining upon their future. Their foundation had risen from the ground like a towering edifice because of him. But everyone knows, even the cosmos will one day vanish, let alone a body of flesh and blood. There are always things that a lifetime cannot accomplish, achievements that even endless years cannot make everlasting.\n\nYet he remained silent, then gently patted the attendant standing rigidly beside him. 'Fetch me paper and pen.' Yanorò said softly. 'Yes, Your Majesty, the Paramount King!' The attendant then walked briskly towards the staircase. Just then, the sky began to shift from blue to grey, and raindrops started to fall. The bustling crowd quickly dispersed, filing into the surrounding buildings. But Yanorò showed no intention of seeking shelter, letting the raindrops slide down his face. In a daze, he gazed at the leaden sky, his aged, clouded eyes shedding scalding tears. Compared to the rain from heaven, this was all the more visible. 'I did it, I did it... Peter, Yesenia, old Nikolai... you can see it from there, can't you... My task is complete now. What comes after, I leave to future generations...' he choked out. At that moment, the attendant ran up with paper and pen, clutching an umbrella under his arm for Yanorò's use.\n\nYanorò took the light quill and wrote on the paper:\n\nI walk at the fork in the road of time, opening the bridgehead of history\nI sing of life's great rises and falls, and lament the sorrows of the world\nI revere the millions of common people, and loathe the wolves and beasts\nI see those who know me speak of my worries, and ponder what those who don't seek\nI only wish my original heart remains in the next life, no longer yearning for eternity\nI walk at the bridgehead of history, opening the mouth of time's path\n\nThen, he dismissed the attendant with a wave of his hand and, on his own, cast the written poem towards the ground. Suddenly, he stepped onto the railing, slowly spread his arms, and gradually leaned forward. The sensation of flight felt freshly familiar to him; the sensation of falling filled him with exhilaration. In that seemingly slow free fall, he felt as if he had finally, truly, been himself. Then, with a heavy, muffled thud, that beam of light vanished. People were first puzzled, then exclaimed in shock, then panicked. It was all too bewildering, truly leaving one at a loss.\n\nYet these aftermath events no longer mattered. And now, within his consciousness, everything began to fade. And in that deathly still, frigid blackness, a beam of white light rushed towards him. Then it transformed into a dilapidated street, and one familiar face after another. Memories flooded into his heart like a tidal wave. Within his consciousness, he walked to the end of that street. There, he saw his younger self clutching a hollow stone. When the wind blew, it emitted a sorrowful melody."

If we accepted them as a pillar of our nation, our income could be significantly boosted. Yet, within our own ranks, a considerable number opposed forming an alliance with these supposedly profit-driven individuals. Thus, the Jews sent representatives to try and forge a covenant with us. Their representative knelt, using an earnest tone bordering on flattery, to convey how fervently they hoped to establish an alliance with us.

EDG_DMR_flavor.16.d:0 "On the flat lands of Germany, a cavalry unit advanced at great speed. The rhythmic thunder of hooves shook the earth, causing even the soil to tremble in unison with the disciplined sound. At the head of this long column rode the aged Alfie. As his steed galloped on, the embroidery on his saddle fluttered ceaselessly. Long ago, after driving out the Holy Roman Emperor, his curious soldiers had once asked him about the origin of this beautiful saddle and its intricate embroidery. Alfie had remained silent, merely stroking the embroidery, as if it had been crafted for him by someone of great importance, someone rumored to have perished long ago on a tragic night.\n\nJust three days prior, he had received a report from his ministers in northern Germany: the Dukes of Saxony, Nordmark, and Ruppin had allied to raise rebellion in the north. Yet, mere decades ago, these three had sworn brotherhood with Alfie. They had exchanged oaths of eternal peace and everlasting fealty. But those vows had now shattered like the river ice on the Elbe in early spring. Alfie's disastrous defeat, lured deep into enemy territory, seemed but a byproduct of this betrayal, followed by agonizing retreat and flight. Along the road, he could not help but lament that he had indeed grown old, no longer possessing the strength to clash with rising powers. Lost in such thoughts, he tightened the reins and gazed at the leaden sky, though the crowing of cocks could already be heard from all directions. Suddenly, the tassels on Alfie's saddle trembled violently, as if harbingers of some fate.\n\nYet, a noise then interrupted his reverie. Scouts reported a large number of Black Eagle banners emerging from the birch forests to the east. Alfie instantly understood the reason for the tassels' tremor. Six Black Eagle banners pierced the morning mist's tranquility, the chainmail of heavy cavalry gleaming with a bone-chilling cold light within the fog. Thousands upon thousands of enemy troops swarmed from all directions, while Alfie now had but twenty-eight men at his side.\n\nAlfie stared at the tide of foes in the distance and sighed: 'Man proposes, Heaven disposes. It seems today I am to die here.' At that moment, the morning sun began to rise, casting golden light across the vast land. The glittering armor seemed to dance with the sunlight until its master's final breath. Alfie drew his sword and roared: 'Though I die today, my nation shall endure for all ages!' The clatter of hooves charged straight into the ant-like mass of the German army's formation, yet that sound vanished instantly, like dew beneath the sun.\n\nAfter dozens of spears pierced Alfie's body, he fell stiffly backward. The embroidery, as always, fluttered in the wind upon the saddle. Only this time, crimson blood served as its tragic adornment. Following the direction of the blood, a star still shone in the sky before plummeting to earth. Then, at some unknown moment, the embroidery on that saddle drifted with the wind, floating gently into the depths of the birch forest."

EDG_DMR_flavor.17.t:0 "Sweet Home"
EDG_DMR_flavor.17.d:0 "Andre stood on the bell tower of Constantinople, clutching a yellowed map in his hand. The wind whipped his faded cloak, revealing the dense patches on the inner lining—each patch marking a territory he had reclaimed. His brother Constantine climbed the stairs: 'Brother, are we really going? The old men in the council say the road to India is harder than passing through hell. And if we leave, who will manage our home in Eastern Europe? Besides, we already have governors in places like India and Persia. What reason do we have to return?' Although Constantine agreed to Andre's request, he, like the old men of the council, felt puzzled.\n\nAndre didn't answer, merely unrolling the map. The parchment depicted twisting rivers and faded stars, with a line of small script in the corner: 'Follow the shadow of the migratory birds, and you will find the ancestors who grew up drinking the water of the Ganges.' This map was what he had traded three cartloads of wheat for from a Persian merchant who, on his deathbed, said it was drawn by the last Romani who remembered the way home.\n\nThe day the first caravan departed, Constantinople experienced a sun shower. Elders tied ancestral copper pots to the wagon roofs, children clutched faded cloth dolls to their chests. Andre personally drove the lead wagon, two glass lanterns hanging from its axle—one containing pebbles from the Danube, the other sand from the Baltic Sea.\n\n'We are like snails, carrying our homes on our shells.' Ten-year-old Lita leaned against the carriage window, watching raindrops trace winding paths on the glass. Her mother was mending an old flag, its wheel pattern worn nearly white. 'Mother, are there snails in India?' 'Yes, child,' the woman bit off the thread, 'perhaps their shells are even carved with our grandmothers' names.'\n\nCrossing the Anatolian Plateau, the caravan was trapped by a sandstorm for seven days. At night, by the campfire, Andre taught the children the stars: 'See those three stars forming a hook? The Romani call it 'Grandmother's Spindle.' Where the spindle points, the river water is sweet.' The day the sandstorm subsided, they found half a stone tablet in a rock crevice. Constantine wiped away the sand, revealing a fragment of a Romani song: '...When the wheel kisses the earth, pomegranate flowers will bloom along the road home...' That evening, Andre distributed pieces of the tablet to each family. 'Keep it close,' he said, 'when we reach the Ganges, use this stone to skip across the water.'\n\nCrossing the Khyber Pass, they were blocked by heavy snow. Seventy-year-old blacksmith Ivan, coughing blood, still insisted on shoeing the horses with anti-slip irons. 'These old bones of mine must be buried in soil where mango trees can be seen.' Before dying, he handed his tool kit to Andre. Inside, wrapped in oilcloth, was a lock of black hair—belonging to his wife, who had died in the Hungarian conflicts.\n\nThe hardest moment came when Lita fell gravely ill with fever. Andre dismantled wagon planks to build a fire. In the firelight, the girl murmured, 'Father, I see peacocks at our doorstep...' Her father, a hussar who had died years ago in battle, was buried on the outskirts of Budapest. Andre smeared the last bit of honey on her cracked lips: 'Hold on. When we reach India, I'll take you to catch real peacocks.'\n\nDays later, as the first morning mist drifted over the Ganges, the lead horse suddenly neighed and knelt. Andre jumped down, his boots sinking into the moist black soil. On the opposite bank, a group of dark-skinned children were drawing water, their copper pots glinting in the rising sun.\n\n'This is it!' Constantine shouted, holding up the astrolabe, 'The bend in the river matches the map perfectly!' The elders tremblingly brought out clay pots, pouring water collected from the Danube, the Dnieper, and the Volga into the Ganges. Small eddies formed on the water's surface, as if the river was embracing its long-lost children. Lita ran barefoot towards the riverbank, startling a flock of egrets. Suddenly, she crouched down and dug a half-bronze bracelet from the mud—its inner side inscribed with the Romani word for 'home.' 'Mother! Is this great-great-grandmother's bracelet?' The woman took the bracelet and wept uncontrollably; centuries ago, her family had been taken from this very place.\n\nBeneath an old Bodhi tree on the outskirts of Delhi, Andre gathered the leaders of seventy-two clans. Sikhs from Punjab brought a model of the Golden Temple, fishermen from Bengal offered shell necklaces, an elder from the nomadic tribes of Rajasthan presented a skin bag filled with camel milk. 'From today,' Andre unwound his turban, revealing his graying braid, 'the Romani wagons need never turn back.' Before everyone, he spread the Wheel Banner of Domria upon the ground. Weaver girls from Kerala stepped forward, using peacock-blue, mango-yellow, and vermilion-red silk threads to embroider lotus flowers and Bodhi leaves beside the wheel pattern. As the flag was raised again, countless floating lanterns drifted down the Ganges—sent by villagers along the banks, each wick soaked in honey.\n\nBefore the monsoon arrived, Andre went alone to the foothills of the Himalayas. In a ruined temple, he found half of a faded mural: Romani ancestors dancing around a campfire, the women wearing inscribed copper bracelets on their wrists. He took out the tool kit Ivan had left him and carved a new inscription on the temple wall: 'Andre Fátyol, seventh-generation homecomer, brought back the lost stars.' Descending the mountain, he saw Lita teaching local children Romani tap dance by the rice paddies. The girl's braids were tied with peacock feathers, which she had traded for with a Baltic seashell necklace. 'Uncle Andre!' She waved and ran over, the bronze bracelet on her wrist jingling, 'I learned how to weave grasshoppers from palm leaves!'\n\nThat evening, the tribe held a ceremony on the riverbank. Constantine was about to sink the last piece of marble city brick, brought from Constantinople, into the riverbed, but Andre stopped him. 'Keep it,' he rubbed the brick's faded eagle insignia, 'a sweet home is not about forgetting the past, but having a place for all memories to rest.' Under the moonlight, the Romani pitched permanent tents for the first time, yet tied bells to every tent stake. 'When our children grow up,' Andre said to the weeping elders, 'they can choose for themselves whether to continue wandering or to stay—that is truly coming home.'\n\nA wind rose over the river, and the curtains of seven hundred wagons swayed gently, like seven hundred migratory birds finally folding their wings."

EDG_DMR_flavor.18.d:0 "Time seems never to hesitate in exerting its power, nor in taking things away from others. Decades had passed since Andre first took his place on the throne. The journey from a spirited youth to a white-haired elder, experienced by his ancestors, had now played out completely in him. After successfully leading his people back to India and unifying their homeland, he immediately abdicated and journeyed alone to Constantinople. This seemed to be his favorite city, though no one could clearly say why.\n\nAt this moment, Andre lay on the bed in a room of the Topkapi Palace, his mind replaying the days of his vibrant, ambitious youth. But he was old now, soon to reach an age where walking would become difficult. What meaning was there in dwelling on these thoughts now? So he collected his thoughts, shifted position, and prepared to sleep again. Yet, this feeling persistently lingered around him. Annoyed, he sat up and drew open the bedroom curtains. The silent night held only the clear moonlight and the occasional chirping of crickets, houses sprinkled with silver dust gleaming under the moon. In the distance, on the waters of the Bosphorus, light and water merged; the tranquil surface seemed to have swallowed the moon, evoking the classic saying of 'flowers in a mirror, the moon in water.' But for Andre, what was the difference between this scene and what he sought in his heart? The aged man had not beheld such a view in a long time, so he rose and walked out the door.\n\nSummer nights always bring an incomparable freshness, and combined with the scent of the sea breeze, it was truly exhilarating. As he gazed upon this city under his rule, memories of the days he had spent here surfaced in his mind. The recollections of his youth were now but traces in a dream; the phrase 'places remain, but people change' seemed apt. He wandered, then looked up to find himself at the entrance of the Hagia Sophia. He pushed the door open and stepped quietly inside. The cathedral was empty. The Virgin in the dome gazed down upon him; moonlight, refracted through the stained glass, shifted and danced. He found a seat, closed his eyes, and sought rest. Suddenly, a chorus of prayer filled his mind. He opened his eyes and looked around, but the cathedral remained empty. Just as he felt puzzled, the light from the stained glass windows grew brighter and more intense, almost blinding him. A tall figure burst through the glass, gently gathering him into an embrace. Yet, miraculously, he did not resist. Instead, he softly closed his eyes, feeling a warmth and joy within the embrace he had never known. Then he opened his eyes again, only to find nothing had changed. Moonlight still streamed through the glass, pooling beside him. He seemed not yet fully returned, his eyes simply brimming with tears. He seemed finally to understand what he had spent years seeking. He walked to the lectern used for sermons, took out paper and pen, and wrote upon it:\n\nMy life bore no virtuous fruit, in daily deeds I took delight in slaughter and fire.\nA sudden holy light brought me enlightenment, severing the shackles of obsession upon me.\nAh! Beneath the great cathedral, the holy light arrives; today at last I know who I am.\n\nThen, he spread his arms, lay slowly upon the floor, and moved no more. The bright moonlight shone upon his face, and upon the first and last work of his life. The next day, when people came to the cathedral for worship, they found his smiling remains. When they tried to lift him, his bones turned to dust. He had finally become one with the world he so deeply loved."

EDG_DMR_flavor.19.d:0 "The distant sky stretched boundless, the land beneath their feet flat and endless. The city before them teemed with people, vendors hawking their wares on every corner, occasionally taking bites of their own goods when hungry. Inside cafes, card players laughed and joked, only the unlucky loser slamming their cards down with a curse. Yet unnoticed by all, two figures—one tall, one small—walked along the city's main thoroughfare toward the outskirts. They wore fine but unobtrusive clothing, as if striving to lower their presence. When the noise in their ears faded and the feeling of jostling crowds grew distant, the two lifted their heads, breathing in the fresh air with delight.\n\n'Your Majesty Father, where are we going?' the child chirped happily, unaware of his father's intent, only sensing that what came next might be fun. 'To meet those we wish to see,' the one the child addressed as father replied softly.\n\nNot far ahead, several rows of willow trees stood side by side. A gentle breeze stirred, scattering willow catkins across the earth. Flakes drifted toward what the willows concealed—rows upon rows of marble tombstones. Just then, the clouds parted, and sunlight spilled onto the black marble, the glare unbearably bright. The adult walked over, pushed aside the willow's embrace, and first beheld a towering stone pillar, flanked by three large gravestones. The child grew instantly excited, striding purposefully toward the central pillar. The pillar stood two or three times his height, so he jumped and hopped beside it, trying to see the inscription atop. Then his father lifted him onto his shoulders. The child looked up and saw gilded characters reading:\n\nMonument to the Great Romani Uprising\n\n'Father, what does 'Great Uprising' mean? Aren't we living quite well?' the child asked curiously, as if in his heart the world held no sorrow. 'Child, we did not always live so happily. Many wished to bully us, to look down upon us. So we fought them. After we fought and won, they finally saw us as equals. That is the meaning of the Great Uprising.' Had anyone stood beside them then, they would have marveled at the father's profound understanding of a child's language.\n\nThe child simply drew out a long 'Oh~', then lifted his head, focusing intently on the smaller characters beneath the gilded letters—they were names, one after another. There were names placed prominently, like Peter Razi and Yesenia Reynolds. There were also names placed quite low, like Luca Best. Yet whether prominent or low, the carved characters would all be eroded by rain and wind over the long years. No one can leave their footprints forever.\n\n'Well, this is boring. Put me down, Father,' the child pouted. Then, a pair of warm, large hands gently lowered him to the ground. At that moment, a butterfly quietly fluttered from a distant meadow toward them. The child excitedly jumped up and chased after the butterfly, leaving his father alone before the three gravestones. The father bent down, beginning to read the tombstones from left to right. Each bore a prominent epitaph, recording the deceased's name and how they departed this world.\n\n'Yanorò Fátyol, First Monarch of the Romani. Left this world with infinite contentment beneath the palace of Pinsk.'\n\n'Alfie Fátyol, Second Monarch of the Romani. Left this world with unyielding will by the banks of the Elbe.'\n\n'Andre Fátyol, Third Monarch of the Romani. Left this world with a heart full of joy within the Hagia Sophia.'\n\nTombstone by tombstone he read, tears rolling down line by line. Several generations of one family striving for the same mission, countless people of a people racing toward the same dream. The journey had been long, traversing too many winding paths. Now they had reached the journey's end. Yet there is never a return trip; we can only stand firm here, whether to protect or for sentiment, whether for grand unity or small differences. We must never lose all this again. The father thought this, then spoke through his tears: 'Rest in peace, ancestors, grandfather, father. We are home, we are home...' As he turned, he saw countless people standing behind him. Among them was his young son, who seemed to have drawn them there. He paused, then began to laugh, and the crowd laughed with him. Finally, the laughter ceased in unison, replaced only by the synchronized cry: 'Long live the Paramount King!' At that moment, the sun shone brightly, and spring's vitality touched the vast earth."

Huddled in the shadow of the bell tower was Quasimodo with his severed ropes, his single eye reflecting the noble carriages blazing in the square below. Romani soldiers dipped Bourbon silk banners into barrels of pitch before hurling them into the fire, where they became swirling, gold-edged gray butterflies. When Alfie's astrologer discovered shackle-worn stone slabs in the cathedral crypt, their markings perfectly overlapped with the migration route of Domria's ancestors across the Caucasus Mountains, the final stroke sharply piercing the tail of Pisces like a tear frozen for a decade.\n\nThree days later, Alfie interrogated the remnants of those who had hunted Esmeralda beneath the rose window, only to find a piece of dried goatskin tucked within the old judge's confession. It bore a hastily sketched diagram of the flamenco steps the Romani girl had taught Quasimodo, the margins filled with annotations from Inquisition interrogators: 'These postures are in truth heretical rituals to summon hellfire.' Enraged, Alfie ordered eight hundred volumes of Inquisition archives spread across the cathedral steps, yet the moment he ignited them, a gust of wind whipped a parchment against his face—the very death sentence for Esmeralda, its wax seal bearing a half-fingerprint identical to the pattern on the hilt of the betrothal dagger at his waist.\n\nThat night, Alfie climbed the bell tower alone and discovered a star chart Quasimodo had pieced together from broken glass on the lead roof, a faded silver bell embedded where Orion's belt would be—the very ornament from the ankle chain Esmeralda had worn since childhood. As he grasped the bell, cheers from the rebel masses suddenly rose beyond the walls; they drank wine from captured monstrances and, drunk, toppled the bronze tablet recording the list of past bishops through the ages. Alfie tied the silver bell to the end of the bell rope, but when he rang the alarm, he snapped the very rope Quasimodo had used to save a life fifteen years prior. At the break, a layer woven with bloodstained hair was revealed—those golden strands stolen back from the gallows now turned to dust with each toll, drifting towards burning Paris."

'They even melted the bones of Saint Denis into stirrups,' she stroked the hilt of King Hugh VII's sword, 'but the bloodline of France will not end!'\n\nThat night, the nobility of the Loire Valley gathered in the underground wine cellar of Chambord Castle. A Provençal poet strummed a lute, but the melody was adapted from a Romani war song. 'We have become strangers in our own land,' the Count of Angoulême splashed red wine onto Domria's tax ledger, 'Let those wanderers taste the might of French cavalry!' They brought out the dust-covered fleur-de-lis battle standard from the cellar's depths, the fabric still bearing the faded golden lilies of the Capetian dynasty.\n\nThe rebellion erupted in the Fontainebleau Forest. Peasants hacked the axles of Domria's grain carts with scythes, while noble militiamen disguised as minstrels infiltrated the camps, mixing belladonna into the wine. Seers observed the 'Hanged Man' card in the stars, unaware it was the rebels' signal—every village displaying inverted fleur-de-lis concealed ballistae.

Andre's envoy announced plans to fill the canals and build land fortresses, unaware dockworkers had long ago repurposed the city's sewer system using lock principles. The night the decree was issued, the rebels opened all sluice gates, letting seawater flood the tax office cellars, pickling entire rooms of parchment tax records. Salted documents floated through the streets; children gathered them, folding them into paper fleets that sailed down the canals toward the parliament building.

Surviving rebel nobles were chained in the halls of the Louvre, awaiting execution one by one. Domrian craftsmen melted fleur-de-lis emblems to cast horseshoes, the rhythmic clanging drowning out the curses of the Capetian nobles. 'You have defiled the glory of Christ!' one noble roared, only to be silenced by a Romani blacksmith with a red-hot branding iron bearing the image of the reversed 'Chariot' card.\n\nQueen Margaret, wife of the rebel King of France, was captured in the cellars of Fontainebleau. The king himself had already perished, adorned with jewels and leaping into the flames of Versailles before Andre's forces took Paris. Fortune-tellers found a blood-stained 'Chanson de Roland' hidden within the queen's dress; the golden lilies on the parchment had been replaced with wheel emblems. 'The history of France needs rewriting,' Andre flicked the ashes from the scroll, ordering the Fontainebleau Forest converted into a traveling circus camp. The rebel's blue-flame wheat fields were sown with Romani clover seeds; come spring, a sea of purple flowers completely covered the Latin challenges upon the scorched earth.\n\nThe harshest retribution was reserved for Versailles. The armor of the Duke of Lorraine was melted into farm tools and distributed to compliant peasants; the spire of the Mont-Saint-Michel abbey was leveled into an astronomical observatory. When the last resisting village surrendered, the Domrians spread the captured fleur-de-lis battle flags across the Seine's surface, and hundreds of chariots thundered over them, the shredded banners drifting with the current toward the Atlantic—fishermen said the tide that night carried the scent of rusted blood."

'Your Merlin lost to our Tarot,' Andre kicked aside fragments of the Sword in the Stone, ordering the Cornish tin mines transformed into quarries for divination crystals. Miners were forced to carve Bogomil scriptures onto tunnel walls, those who refused sealed within abandoned shafts.\n\nThe final resistance in the British Isles ended at Edinburgh. The rebels' raven messengers were tamed into courier birds, their feathers dyed with Wheel Banner patterns; clan totems from the Scottish Highlands were melted into chariot axles. As the Domrian fleet departed, they cast tons of Celtic copper coins into the North Sea—the coins' reverse sides bore a small inscription: 'The seas forever belong to the wanderers.'"

'The fire of heresy is fire too,' declared Andre as he thrust his blade into Seville Cathedral's altar, where fissures carved wheel patterns into the stone slab. Andalusian shepherds were conscripted as charioteers, their sheep's collars replaced with bronze bells engraved with the Strength card. The final reckoning unfolded in Madrid. The rebels' crowns were melted into horse bits, fitted to the warhorses of surrendered nobles.

The tarot cards in Venice's crystal chandeliers were replaced uniformly with reversed 'Empress' cards, candlelight projections morphing into chains binding the Doge.\n\nMilan Arsenal's operatic code became a Domrian marching song, the repeating crossbows mounted on painted wagons as ceremonial weapons. Florence's bronze poet statues were toppled and recast, the new figures holding tarot cards and swords pointed skyward, their bases inscribed: 'Wanderers need no Muse.'

Captain Dirk stood upon the great dike, watching the gradually exposed seabed—the meticulously laid reed bed traps lay completely bare after the ebb tide, like scars stripped of disguise. Romani sappers used improved drilling rigs to bore secret channels at the dike's base, flushing all the iron caltrops the rebels had buried in the silt into the deep sea.\n\nThe rebels' final counterattack dissolved into nothingness at Rotterdam Harbor. Dirk ordered asphalt-filled fishing boats set ablaze and rammed towards the Domrian fleet, only to find mirrored windmill blades erected on the enemy decks. The midday sun, refracted and focused by the mirrors, ignited the fire ships before they could draw near. In the black smoke, Domrian signalmen flashed a taunting message with reflective panels: 'You cannot even master your own fire.'\n\nThe deadliest betrayal came from within the windmills. A bribed rebel technician altered the gear meshing angles of the blades, causing three crucial windmills to spin out of control during a stormy night. The iron blades swept like giant scythes, flattening the barns storing weaponry. When Andre's cavalry charged into Amsterdam over the wreckage of the windmills, the citizens discovered the salted tax documents floating in the canals had long been replaced by the Romani—the new tax decrees were written in waterproof ink, even accompanied by improved drainage plans. Dirk retreated to the last windmill tower, only to find a yellowed letter hidden within the gearbox. It was from his son, who had perished at sea years ago, written to a Romani pen pal: 'Father always says the sea cannot be conquered, but perhaps the true enemy is not in the waves...' The windmill's shadow fell upon the square, forming precisely the pattern of an inverted 'Chariot' card—Domrian seers had buried the prophetic stone carving there twenty years prior."

Seeing the one with the hoe, he suddenly burst into laughter: 'Andre, you are a member of our Fátyol family, yet you toil in the fields every day? How disgraceful.' But he was met only with indifference. The youth on horseback snorted, turned his horse, and rode away. Andre watched his retreating figure and shook his head. 'My dear brother Constantine, we are no different from the common people now. We, too, are but part of the populace.' He then continued swinging the hoe as if nothing had happened.\n\nNot long after, the youth named Constantine returned. But the arrogance and anger in his eyes were gone. The moment he saw Andre, he hurriedly dismounted, ran to his side, placed his hands on Andre's shoulders, and shook him hard. 'It's terrible! Father was in a carriage accident in the city. He's critically injured! You must come with me to see him one last time!' Andre wasted no time, mounting the horse and riding with Constantine towards the official residence in Constantinople.\n\nBut the reality was far worse than they imagined. When Andre and Constantine arrived at the residence, their father had only his last breaths left. Seeing his sons, their father, the Mayor of Constantinople, suddenly raised his frail body with great effort. Then came his fading voice: 'I am dying... When I die, my position will be automatically revoked, and the estate will revert to the state. You two brothers must find a way to make your own living...' The moment these words left his lips, the light vanished from his eyes. Only his two sons and the surrounding relatives remained, first in stunned silence, then in sorrowful weeping and words of farewell.

Andre huddled inside the drafty shelter, leafing through a tattered copy of the 'Bogomil Chronicles' by the flickering light of an oil lamp. Between the pages lay the bronze waist token his father had left behind, engraved with the twin-wheel emblem of the Fátyol family—once a symbol of the Constantinople mayor's authority, now his last possession of any value. Three years had passed since the upheaval that drove him and his younger brother Constantine from the capital, scattering them like dandelion seeds in the wind to this place. During these three years, momentous events had unfolded. The court, left leaderless by Alfie's sudden death, teetered on the brink of collapse; chaotic order only began to recover months later. As Alfie died without leaving any heir to inherit the throne, the pedantic old bureaucrats led by the Lord Chamberlain prematurely declared the Domrian Republic. Under their protection, the corrupt officials once ruthlessly suppressed by Alfie, now in collusion with them, staged a comeback, once again poisoning this long-suffering land. Tears and cries arose for the just, while enemies and rivals mourned the strong.\n\nOn the muddy path outside the window, a squad of Domrian tax collectors was going door-to-door, confiscating copperware. Andre watched them toss an old blacksmith's ancestral crucible onto an oxcart; the clanging sound reminded him of the closing gates of Constantinople. 'They say it's for casting a new Peace Bell for the capital,' Constantine added some damp firewood to the hearth, the green smoke making him cough, 'but merchants in the tavern say the molten metal flowing from the furnaces is tinged with blood.'\n\nWhen the tax collectors kicked open the shack's wooden door, Andre was sketching a star chart on the wall with charcoal. The head taxman grabbed him by the collar, and the bronze waist token slipped from his tattered clothes. 'The Fátyol family?' the man sneered, tossing the token into the fire. 'Now even stray dogs dare impersonate nobles!' As the flames consumed the emblem, Andre suddenly seized the taxman's wrist, his fingers digging deep into the man's flesh: 'Tell your master, who knows no hardship, that some embers cannot be extinguished.' All he received in return was a vicious beating. When Andre could no longer stand, the old bureaucrats' lackeys roared with laughter and strode out the door. Little did they know that the fire smoldering in the eyes of the man behind them would, in a few years, burn them to ashes.\n\nThat night, the brothers crossed the Vistula River on the thin ice of early spring. On the riverbank, Andre picked up half a stone tablet inscribed with ancient Norse runes. In the moonlight, he could just make out the words: 'The king hides among the people.' Suddenly, he remembered when he was seven, his father pointing to a crack in the walls of Constantinople and saying: 'True fissures are not in the bricks and mortar, but in the hearts of men.'"

Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, the long-suppressed old nobility began launching minor rebellions and non-cooperation movements.\n\nAt the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, in a birch forest, Andre was coating twenty modified wagons with pine resin. These cargo wagons, abandoned by nobles, were transformed under his hands into mobile archery towers—concealed compartments on the roofs could hide archers, and false floors stored fire oil. 'We are not rebels,' he told the gathered refugees, 'we are merely reclaiming our pawned dignity.'\n\nThe first strike targeted a toll station on a tributary of the Danube. As the tax collectors drunkenly counted copper coins, dozens of lotus lanterns suddenly drifted down the river. The guards laughed as they fished them out, unaware the wicks were connected to oil-soaked hemp ropes. The moment flames shot up, Andre's wagon convoy charged from the mountain pass, flaming arrows precisely severing the chains of the drawbridge. Constantine stood atop the lead wagon, throwing tax ledgers into the fire: 'See! Ledgers of greed burn easier than straw!'\n\nWhen the news reached Constantinople, the Regency Council was busy quarreling over whether to impose a wine tax. 'Just a band of wandering brigands,' the Chief Justice dismissed the messenger, 'they'll starve come winter...' Yet the refugee force swelled like a snowball: peasants stripped of their fields, expelled heretical monks, even defecting low-ranking officers. When Andre captured the first granary, people noticed his peculiar method of distributing grain—each sack of wheat given out contained a pottery shard engraved with the twin-wheel emblem."

Who would have thought a destitute youth from Krakow could grow into this? But his luck ends here.'\n\nWith that, dozens of voices erupted in laughter from behind the hall's curtains. The Habsburg prince drew back the curtain and joined the laughter. 'Thank you for your great assistance, esteemed Romani elders. Once I restore the realm, I will certainly not neglect your people within my borders and will return your property and slaves. We must never let this 'robbing the rich to aid the poor' upstart sit upon the highest throne.'

The gilded-armored commander pointed at Andre's cloth-clad ranks and sneered, 'Scythes against heavy cavalry? A joke!' The moment war drums thundered, the horizon was suddenly blotted out by a towering cloud of dust—it was thousands of wild oxen Andre had ordered peasants to drive forth, their horns bound with oil-soaked cloth. This tactic would later be known as the Fire Ox Formation. One against a hundred, yet an army of ten thousand stands no chance.\n\nJust as the heavy cavalry was scattered by the stampede, a deafening roar tore through the sky. A crimson meteor streaked through the clouds, trailing the scent of sulfur, and plummeted into the heart of the royal army's formation. Warhorses reared in panic, armor shattered, and the commander's gilded helmet was blasted sky-high, finally catching on the axle of Andre's wagon. 'A celestial warning!' the army astrologer collapsed to the ground. 'This portends the rise of a new king!' Upon hearing his cry, the others were instantly thrown into panic, scattering in all directions. Flee left? Blocked by Andre's heavy chariots. Flee right? Encircled by advancing infantry. Press forward—the path to survival.\n\nThe final outcome was clear. Most of the fifty thousand royal troops were annihilated, and their commander perished on the field. What was both surprising and yet fitting was the fate of that army astrologer—his pronouncement earned Andre's praise, and he retained his position within Andre's forces, spared any punishment as a defeated combatant.\n\nLater historical records claimed the meteorite was the result of gunpowder Andre had secretly buried atop a mountain in advance. But the fleeing soldiers of the time swore oaths they had seen the twin-wheel emblem floating on the meteor's surface. After this battle, nursery rhymes of a 'heaven-sent imperial star' spread across the land. Even bakers in Constantinople secretly shaped their dough into falling stars."

Now, the troops of the old bureaucrats and the council they represented had also been decimated by Andre. After such relentless setbacks, they finally retreated to Vienna, the former imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Since the era of the Archduchy of Austria, Vienna had been among the most formidable fortresses, and centuries of peaceful development had added layer upon layer of fortifications. Without a doubt, this would be an unprecedented, brutal battle.\n\nOn a certain morning that historians would later call the Siege of Vienna, the battle in the bloody civil war commenced. Yet, contrary to the legendary epics later chronicled by historians, the initial assaults were disastrous. Vienna's centuries of fortifications, combined with the inferior quality and numbers of Andre's troops compared to the regular army that had once taken the city, meant his charges were shattered one after another. Even the combined bombardment of dozens of cannons could not match the defenders' speed in repairing the walls.\n\nThe ice on the Danube groaned under the artillery fire, yet Andre ordered the siege ladders dismantled. 'The true walls are here,' he pointed to his own heart, 'and in theirs.' For seven consecutive days, the rebel army merely encircled Vienna, singing the ancient 'Epic of Freedom,' the melodies carried by the north wind into every crevice of the fortifications.\n\nOn the dawn of the tenth day, the defenders of the West Gate suddenly defected. When Andre entered the city on the morning dew, he found the streets strewn with salt—an ancient ritual of purification performed spontaneously by the citizens. 'We do not fear a change of dynasty,' the old mayor presented the city keys, 'we only fear a world worse than this.' In the town square, Andre did something that shocked all of Europe: he publicly burned the nobility register but distributed land deeds to guild representatives. 'Remember, I am not granting you these,' the firelight illuminated his cracked lips, 'you should have always possessed them.'\n\nMeanwhile, the councilors of the Regency, who had fled Constantinople and hidden within Vienna, quietly emerged from the town hall, unaware Andre had long fixed his gaze upon them. He suddenly drew his sword, pointing at them as they tried to disappear into the crowd. At their head was the Lord Chamberlain who had organized the council after Alfie's death. Seeing this, the Chamberlain let out a deep sigh. 'When our previous king died, everyone was at a loss. As one of his most trusted officials, I could only try to organize the nobility and council to stabilize the nation. Sadly, my abilities were insufficient; I could not bear this great responsibility. I have brought shame upon you and your family. I have no complaint if you wish to execute or punish me.' Tears streamed down his aged face, filled with unending sorrow and self-reproach. Andre simply walked over and patted his shoulder. 'No one is born a good leader, nor is anyone born with three heads and six arms. You did the best you could.' With that, he laughed heartily, embracing the weeping Chamberlain. On the roof of the Schönbrunn Palace, a white dove slowly took flight, then gently alighted upon Andre's hand."

'When I turn left, you debate laws; when I turn right, you dispute borders; if I stand still...' he suddenly removed his crown, 'then it is time for someone who can move the age forward.'\n\nThat year's harvest festival saw grapes from Crimea and herring from the Baltic Sea appear on the same table for the first time.

When the archbishop presented the holy oil, Andre suddenly grabbed the flask and poured it over the crowd: 'If this anointing oil truly has divine power, it should nourish all parched lands!' The people on both sides, eyes brimming with tears, then cried out the name of His Majesty Andre. Countless flowers and olive branches were cast towards the oak chariot, a tribute both to the great peacemaker and an ode to the new nation's leader.

Countless pairs of eyes met a single pair; countless gazes merged with one torchlight. Then the crowd fell silent. Andre, tears welling in his eyes, picked up the flowers that had been thrown onto the chariot roof and returned them one by one to the people. Then everyone cheered, for all that was dear to their hearts, and for the nation's bright new future.\n\nDecades later, when travelers passed through Ruthenia, they would see a wondrous sight in a certain nameless town of the region: settlers' stone houses intermingled with nomads' tents; schoolchildren studied both Aristotle and astrology; the marketplace circulated both imperial silver coins and the ancient tradition of barter.

Upon seeing the youth, the knights immediately bowed deeply and respectfully, chanting in unison: 'Good evening, Your Highness Alfie!'\n\nThe cloaked man, hearing this address, jolted as if struck by lightning. He scrambled up from the ground, grabbing Alfie's clothes with both hands, pulling at them repeatedly, then yanked off his hood, gasping for breath: 'Your Highness, disaster is upon us!' Alfie looked closely and nearly cried out in shock. This face, smeared with mud, covered in wounds, the black cloak in tatters, was none other than the court diviner who had often played with him in his childhood. A pang of sorrow and pity struck Alfie's heart, and he hurriedly guided the diviner into the castle.\n\n'What!' Alfie exclaimed in shock, the teacup of hot tea slipping from his hand, shattering on the floor. 'My brother could commit such an act of treason!' 'It's the absolute truth!' the diviner also shouted passionately, his voice edged with urgency and anger. 'Then, what should we do? I am merely an ordinary governor, and our founding emperor established the rule that governors cannot command troops.' Alfie frowned, his face full of worry. Hearing this, both Alfie and the diviner fell into deep thought. A moment later, Alfie suddenly slammed the table, stood up, and shouted: 'It's time to leave.' 'Leave? If we seek aid from foreign armies, they will surely demand exorbitant prices and hold us hostage afterward. Even so, are you willing? And where could we even go?' The diviner, full of doubt, fired off questions. At that moment, the confusion in Alfie's eyes vanished, replaced by determination. He spoke slowly:"

EDG_DMR_flavor.46.d:0 "In the catacombs beneath the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, candles cast wavering shadows on the damp stone walls. Michy removed his bloodstained leather gloves, his fingers lightly touching the black-draped icon of the Virgin. 'Your Eminence,' he drew back the cloth, revealing the cracks in the gilded statue, 'do you believe these holy images are more potent than my sword?'\n\nOrthodox Patriarch Maxim lifted a silver goblet, the red wine within glowing dark crimson in the candlelight. 'The people will not bow for power, but they will fight to the death for faith—your father should have taught you that lesson when he burned the churches of Novgorod.' He tapped the wall with his staff, and a hidden door slowly opened. Twelve black-robed monks carried out three wooden chests: the first contained fragments of icons torn apart by the Bogomils, the second held parchments of 'sacrilege' by the Romani, and the third held a desiccated corpse clad in purple robes. 'The relics of Saint Vladimir,' the Patriarch's breathing quickened, 'if we can make the faithful believe the heretics desecrated the holy tomb...'\n\nThe conspiracy unfolded quietly before Easter. Michy's cavalry raided a Bogomil monastery in Smolensk, piling the confiscated astrolabes in the square. The Patriarch personally lit the pyre, proclaiming loudly: 'Behold! These demonic tools reveal infernal runes in the flames!' Rumors began to spread among the crowd: of a prophesy-inscribed stone tablet found at the bottom of the Dnieper River, of a double-headed eagle pecking out the eyes of heretics.\n\nDuring Easter morning prayers, the uprising erupted. Romani officials in Kiev pushed open the cathedral doors to see thousands of faithful kneeling before Michy's gilded armor. A gem taken from the saint's relics was embedded in the armor's breastplate, gleaming with a cross-shaped light in the morning sun. 'Holy war!' the people cried, smashing stained glass windows with candlesticks, brandishing crosses anointed with holy oil as they charged the town hall. Michy's soldiers mingled within the mob, their armbands embroidered with the Orthodox cross, masking their original family insignias.\n\nThe true masterstroke was at Odessa port. There, the harbor lighthouse was transformed into a massive icon screen—craftsmen used colored glass fragments to create an image of the 'Weeping Virgin.' Under moonlight, the tear's path pointed precisely towards the Romani fleet. Three fishing boats laden with fire oil, guided by this phantom, rammed other vessels. Through the thick smoke echoed the Patriarch's voice: 'This is God's punishment upon the heretics!'\n\nSeven days later, Michy was crowned upon the charred ruins of a Bogomil altar. Crushed crystal formed the new crown; the covers of twelve Gospels were replaced with paintings of Romani migration. As the monks chanted hymns, no one noticed the Patriarch quietly pocketing the finger bone of Saint Vladimir—it was merely an anonymous bone he had unearthed from a mass grave."

The city's residents, as usual, began their busy day for sustenance, the streets and alleys filled with hurried footsteps and bustling noise.\n\nHowever, Alfie, standing beneath the city gate at this moment, had no mind for this ordinary, lively scene. Frowning, his heart full of anxiety, he gazed towards the vast, boundless blue sky. The sudden upheaval of the previous night had exploded like a heavy bomb, shattering Alfie's original thoughts and plans. With the situation critical, he made a decisive judgment and resolved to flee to France, seeking aid from the Capetian dynasty. He knew well that the Capetians and the Holy Roman Empire had long-standing grievances and were constantly at odds. The opportunity he now presented was one that King Philip Augustus and his descendants would certainly not let slip by.\n\nBut Alfie also understood that his brother Michy had likely anticipated his escape and might have already dispatched heavy troops in his direction. To ensure his safety, Alfie meticulously planned. He left the diviner and other attendants within the city, having them skillfully disguise themselves to create the illusion that he was still there. Alone, he came to the secluded West Gate. Carefully disguised, he mounted a sturdy steed, ready to flee at full speed towards France.\n\n'I can wait no longer,' Alfie murmured in a low voice, full of resolve. He slowly turned his head, his gaze sweeping affectionately over the city he had lived in for over a decade. Here lay his memories, his attachments, yet now, for the convictions in his heart and the unfinished cause, he had to depart. Gritting his teeth, he firmly pulled the reins. Instantly, the horse reared up, let out a whinny, and then shot forward like an arrow from a bow, galloping down the unknown road ahead, raising a cloud of dust in its wake."

EDG_DMR_flavor.48.t:0 "The Scheme"
EDG_DMR_flavor.48.d:0 "In the darkness, Alfie trudged wearily along the rugged path. After days and nights of relentless travel, he finally reached the port city on the nation's western border. The vast, boundless sea now seemed a mysterious gateway to freedom and hope; if only he could board a ship, he could sail to the port of Calais in France and temporarily escape the shadow of death that pursued him.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to him, Michy had already issued a warrant for his arrest across the nation during his flight and had reinforced border defenses as if facing a dire threat, determined to capture him like a turtle in a jar. Now, every inch of this port city was shrouded in a tense, ominous atmosphere. Wanted posters bearing Alfie's image were plastered everywhere like snowflakes—in the city's streets and alleys, on country paths, on the walls of humble huts and opulent villas alike. His fate was pinned upon those flimsy sheets of paper, scrutinized by countless eyes. The soldiers guarding the city gates held the warrants in one hand, berating passersby with the other, their eyes sharp, missing no suspicious sign. Watching this scene from afar, a wave of despair washed over Alfie, chilling his heart.\n\nThe days that followed made Alfie's escape even more difficult. The stringent searches at the city gates made entering impossible, forcing him to camp in the wilderness outside, braving biting winds and cold moonlight. Blocked by insurmountable checkpoints ahead and relentlessly pursued from behind, Alfie, trapped in this desperate dilemma, felt his hair gradually turning white with worry. The spirited confidence of old was gone, replaced only by a face full of weariness and sorrow.\n\nOne day, as usual, Alfie sat despondently by a fence outside the city, lost and helpless, with no clue about the way forward. Just as he was at his wit's end, a strong hand suddenly reached from behind, yanking him into the woods. Alfie instantly grew alert, about to struggle, when he saw a familiar face, followed by the sight of a white-haired girl. 'Diviner? And Carmen? How are you here?' Alfie cried out in surprise and joy, his eyes filled with confusion and disbelief.\n\n'Your Highness,' the diviner sighed softly, 'after you left Krakow, the pursuers flooded the city. They searched everywhere for you, causing chaos. To save my own life, and hoping to find you, I had to flee the city. When I saw this young lady, she kept asking about your whereabouts. I thought she might be important to you, so I brought her along. I hope you don't mind.'\n\n'Of course not,' Alfie said, slowly rising to his feet and embracing the white-haired girl tightly. They wept, then laughed through their tears, their emotions fluctuating with the joy of a reunion after such peril. The diviner watched, baffled. After a while, he asked, 'So, who is this girl? Is she someone important to you?'\n\n'In a sense, she is my childhood friend, and perhaps my beloved,' Alfie replied, a hint of a happy smile touching his lips.\n\n'Who's your beloved?' Carmen Safani retorted, her cheeks flushing.\n\n'Enough, enough. Let's discuss what to do next. We can talk about such matters later,' the diviner shook his head helplessly, then turned to Alfie with a grave expression. 'With the current level of search, you certainly cannot enter the city. Though your hair has turned white with worry, your features are still easily recognizable. If discovered, you will surely be caught.' The diviner heaved another heavy sigh.\n\nHearing this, Alfie slowly crouched down, holding his head in his hands, sinking into deep thought. Just then, Carmen slowly raised her hand, as if making a momentous decision. Both the diviner and Alfie looked at her. Carmen gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with determination. She nodded forcefully and said, her voice trembling slightly, 'While my appearance differs somewhat from Alfie's, at night the guards would likely struggle to tell us apart. And we both have white hair now. I can be captured in Alfie's place.'\n\n'How can that be?' Alfie exploded, standing up instantly. 'Forget how they would react upon seeing you; with the heavy guard presence, even getting through is a huge problem. Most importantly,' Alfie paused, his eyes reddening slightly, 'if the price for all this is your life, I'd rather return and let Michy capture me.'\n\n'Which is more important, the nation or your beloved?' Carmen stared straight at Alfie, equally impassioned. Alfie instinctively looked at the diviner, who also wore an expression expecting him to accept. Under their gazes, Alfie wrestled internally. Finally, in resignation and anguish, he slowly nodded, agreeing to this nearly hopeless plan."

EDG_DMR_flavor.49.d:0 "The setting sun hung like blood, slowly sinking below the horizon, its last rays devoured by darkness. Moonlight cascaded like water over the border port, casting a cold veil over this perilous night. After a tense and secretive afternoon of preparation, Carmen, Alfie, and the diviner, their hearts filled with trepidation and a desperate resolve, stealthily boarded the carriage brought by the diviner and headed towards the city gates.\n\nIn the distance, the wide-open gates began slowly closing. Stern soldiers paced back and forth nearby, ready to end their day's watch and return within the city walls. The carriage moved silently towards the moat, the clip-clop of hooves starkly conspicuous in the silent night. The weary gate guards sighed, eager to finish their duty. When the diviner calmly presented the forged pass, the soldiers waved them through casually. For a moment, the trio breathed a sigh of relief, thinking all would proceed smoothly. Yet, just as the carriage was about to pass through the gateway, the soldiers' captain suddenly rushed out from the side. His gaze was sharp as a hawk's, and he pointed sternly at the carriage, shouting: 'Call out the people inside for inspection!'\n\nThe air inside the carriage froze. Carmen took a deep breath, slowly opened the door, and stepped down. The captain stared intently at her, his eyes seeming to pierce through her. Then, he glanced quickly at the warrant in his hand, a flash of delight and triumph in his eyes. 'That's the fugitive! Get over here!' he yelled, grabbing Carmen's arm and yanking her towards him. Carmen stumbled, tripped over a stone, and fell uncontrollably against the captain. Instinctively, he tried to catch her, but his hand inadvertently touched her chest. The captain paused for a moment, then his expression turned vicious and severe.\n\nSeizing the moment, Carmen erupted with astonishing strength, shoving the captain away and turning to shout at the carriage: 'Alfie, run!' Hearing the cry, Alfie inside the carriage hesitated not a second. He leapt from the carriage door and sprinted towards the alleyways surrounding the city. Several soldiers gave chase immediately. The captain quickly recovered, drawing a pistol and aiming at Alfie's head, ready to end the pursuit with one shot. At that critical moment, Carmen charged forward without hesitation. She threw herself in front of Alfie, using her body to block the fatal bullet. The excruciating pain of her pierced heart instantly drained the color from her face, yet she mustered her last ounce of strength to cry out: 'Your Highness... no, Alfie... let us meet again in heaven!' With those words, she collapsed onto the cold ground, her life extinguishing like a candle in the wind.\n\nThe captain showed no pity, merely kicking Carmen's body aside in disgust, then mounted the diviner's carriage to continue the pursuit. However, the moment he mounted the horse, its front legs suddenly buckled, throwing him violently to the ground. His head and neck struck the earth at a grotesque angle, killing him instantly. 'Your Highness, I wish you a smooth journey!' yelled the enraged remaining soldiers as they hacked the diviner, who had tripped the horse, to pieces.\n\nAlfie, having fled far away, hid inside a water vat in a house. Hearing the anguished cries from outside, he closed his eyes, stifled sobs rising in his throat. An indeterminate time later, when the sounds of soldiers ordering a 'split up and search' came from outside, he cautiously peeked out from the vat and raced towards the last ship at the port. He knew he could not look back—not for the sacrifice of Carmen and the diviner, for their hopes and promises, and especially for the nation's future.\n\nOn the mist-shrouded coastline, Alfie concealed himself inside a cargo crate, waiting to be shipped to Calais, and then to Paris. Under the moonlight, the shimmering water's surface and the long shadows cast by swaying sails seemed to recount the night's heart-stopping events. He swore silently in his heart that one day, he would return with hope and strength, overthrow the detestable tyrant in the palace, and let justice and light shine once more upon this land."

EDG_DMR_flavor.50.d:0 "Upon the tempestuous sea, a great vessel cleaved through rolling waves, struggling forward. After days and nights of a long voyage, the horn signaling docking finally sounded. Throughout the arduous journey, Alfie had been confined to a cramped crate. Now, like a bird set free, he burst forth. He had endured the hardships of travel, subsisting on the ship's meager provisions, until at last he reached Paris.\n\nAs he approached the outskirts of Paris, a lavishly equipped carriage caught his eye. The banner of Orleans flew high upon it, and Alfie surmised the Duke of Orleans must be within. Without hesitation, he rushed forward and knocked on the carriage door, his sole thought to request permission to enter Paris with the Duke. Inside, the Duke, resting with eyes closed, was disturbed by the sudden knocking. He opened the door, puzzled. The sight of the ragged youth before him sparked immediate anger, and he was about to rebuke him sharply. Yet, upon a closer look, Alfie's destitute appearance could not obscure his noble bearing and the resolute fire in his eyes. The Duke was struck; instinct told him this was no ordinary man. The Duke spoke: 'I am on my way to the royal palace to discuss the obligations between lord and vassal with His Majesty. I intended to bring twenty attendants, but I am one short. Time is pressing; I cannot wait longer and must proceed.' Hearing this, Alfie immediately knelt on one knee, clasped his hands, and earnestly pleaded: 'Allow me to serve you!' The Duke looked at him and sighed in resignation. 'That may be, but in your current state, entering the palace is impossible. Give me time to have someone take you to change your clothes and wash up.'\n\nOnce inside Paris, the other nineteen attendants conversed with the Duke and Alfie. As soon as Alfie spoke, his eloquent and clever words deeply impressed them all.\n\nLater, the Duke entered the palace for talks with his nineteen attendants and Alfie. From sunrise until the sun stood high at noon, they remained at an impasse, having reached no conclusion. Then, the nineteen spoke in unison to Alfie: 'You go!' Alfie placed his hand upon his sword and steadily ascended the steps. He said to the Duke, 'Matters of obligation can be clarified in a few sentences. Having discussed for so long, why is nothing decided?' Hearing this, the King of France turned to the Duke and asked, 'Who is this man?' The Duke hastily replied, 'He is one of my attendants.' The King immediately reprimanded, 'Stand down! I am speaking with your master. Why do you interfere?' Instead of retreating, Alfie pressed forward, hand on sword, and sternly rebuked the King: 'You are quite imposing! Your harsh words to me rely solely on the multitude of France. But at this moment, within ten paces, Your Majesty's life hangs by my hand—what use are numbers then? My lord is before you; why do you reprimand me? Moreover, if mighty France seeks to strip away vassals' obligations and disregard contracts between nobles, then from Ireland to Cathay, your infamy will be known to all! Is this truly your wish?'\n\nStartled by this fierce onslaught, the King hurriedly said, 'My earlier words were improper; my attitude towards you was wrong, I beg your pardon. I see you possess exceptional bearing, unlike ordinary men. Why serve only under the Duke of Orleans?' Alfie took a deep breath, his expression filled with sorrow, and spoke slowly: 'I am a prince of Domria, come to save my nation. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to lend me an army. Upon my return to my country, I shall offer rich recompense.' Hearing this, the King laughed heartily. 'Rich recompense is unnecessary. I shall lend you an army of twenty thousand men—consider it my gift to you!'"

EDG_DMR_flavor.51.d:0 "With the aid of the grand French army and twenty thousand infantry, Alfie, employing his masterful and practiced skills, swiftly reversed the decline brought upon the nation by the Holy Roman Empire. The House of Habsburg suffered successive major defeats. As news of these defeats spread, dissatisfaction with the Emperor within the Holy Roman Empire grew fiercer, burning like a raging fire.\n\nThe Emperor had once firmly believed in Domria's weakness, but now, faced with repeated failures, his will finally broke, and he decided to withdraw his forces. Little did he know fate's mockery was just beginning. During the retreat, Alfie's troops appeared as if descended from heaven, launching a fierce interception. In the ensuing chaos, battle cries shook the skies, and the Holy Roman army was routed, suffering heavy losses. The Emperor fled in panic, nearly captured. After this battle, the Habsburg crown seemed shrouded in an ominous gloom, its former luster gone forever.\n\nAs for Michy, the instigator of the rebellion, when he heard the news of Alfie's crushing defeat of the Emperor, he felt as if plunged into an icy abyss, his blood seeming to freeze. Fear engulfed him like a tidal wave, and he fled the capital in panic. But his flight brought no salvation. Soldiers who had once served him, seeing the turn of events, defected en masse. On his escape route, Michy was brutally killed by these turncoat soldiers, who then severed his head and displayed it publicly, seeking to claim credit and reward from Alfie.\n\nAs the smoke of war gradually cleared, one place remained on Alfie's mind. Without delay, he hastened back to the frontier checkpoint and port city from which he had fled, a place filled with memories. Past suffering and humiliation churned within him. He ordered the soldiers who had killed the diviner and Carmen to be brought before him. When those soldiers learned that this imposing figure before them was none other than the man they had once been ordered to capture, now the Paramount King Alfie, their faces turned deathly pale, their legs gave way, and they fell to their knees with a 'thud,' kowtowing incessantly, their foreheads striking the ground with dull thumps, muttering pleas for Alfie's forgiveness.\n\nAlfie watched them silently, his gaze cold. After a long while, he spoke slowly: 'I will not kill you, for you were performing your duty then. But you must come with me to pay homage to them.' The soldiers dared not disobey in the slightest, hurriedly kowtowing heavily in gratitude.\n\nWith this matter settled, Alfie's figure gradually receded. He climbed the towering city wall alone. The sea breeze gently brushed his face, carrying the unique scent of the ocean. He stood there quietly, gazing at the distant horizon over the sea, awaiting the sunrise. Finally, the first rays of sunlight pierced the clouds, bathing his face, gilding him in a golden radiance. At this moment, Alfie resembled the rising sun itself, full of hope and strength. He knew deeply that he would shoulder the responsibility of leading all the Romani people forward, striding towards a bright future."

'Your Excellency,' the Mayor's voice came from behind, 'the draft port tax reform you requested...'\n\nBefore he could finish, a wooden chariot model suddenly bumped against Alfie's boot heel. Four-year-old Andre peered from behind a marble column, woolly curls dusted with cookie crumbs: 'My chariot is faster than yours!' The Mayor hurriedly reached for his son, but the boy nimbly ducked under his father's arm, holding up the wooden cart and shouting: 'Look! This is the new grain route Papa mentioned, to bypass the greedy tax collectors' posts!'\n\nAlfie crouched down, his fingertip brushing the painted wheel on the wooden cart: 'Who taught you to make this?'\n\n'The dockworkers!' Andre pulled wood scraps from his pocket. 'Uncle Nikolai the Lame said a truly good road should be like a blood vessel, sending grain to the hungriest bellies!'\n\nThe Mayor cleared his throat softly: 'A child's words carry no harm, Your Excellency, please...' 'It's fine.' Alfie suddenly drew the dagger, startling the Mayor half a step back. But he turned the hilt towards the child: 'How about using this as a flagpole?'\n\nAndre took the dagger and stuck it into the wooden cart, tilting his head to examine it: 'It's unhappy.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Its ruby is lost, like a granary missing wheat.' The child pulled a glass marble from his pocket and pressed it into the empty setting. 'Now it's complete!'\n\nIn the distance, bells chimed. As Alfie stood up, Andre suddenly tugged his cloak: 'Are you leaving? Mama says important people always disappear suddenly.' 'I won't,' Alfie unfastened his cloak and wrapped it around the child, 'but I need to borrow your father for a while.'\n\nAs the Mayor closed the balcony door, he glanced back to see his son using the dagger flagpole to command a line of tin soldiers.

He remembered the scene three months prior—Orthodox Patriarch Maxim standing on the steps of the Novgorod Cathedral, publicly burning Bogomil star charts. 'Heretical lies,' the old Patriarch pointed his staff at the trembling Romani diviner, 'fit only for repentance in holy fire!'\n\nNow, Yanorò's soldiers were piling pine-resin-soaked wool blankets against the church walls. The army blacksmith Nikolai could not help speaking: 'Milord, these stained glass windows are the work of twelfth-century Venetian craftsmen...' 'All the more reason to burn them clean,' Yanorò lifted a fragment of colored glass with his knife tip. 'Let everyone remember, only one faith shall illuminate Novgorod.' Maxim burst from the church with his monks, a silver crucifix swaying in the firelight. 'You will go to hell!' The old Patriarch's curse was shredded by the north wind. Yanorò raised a hand to signal a pause, pulled a charred copy of the 'Bogomil Scripture' from his saddlebag—the very same remnant volume burned three months ago. 'Your fire didn't finish the job,' he tossed the remnant onto the pyre. 'Tonight, let us complete it.'\n\nAs the first torch was thrown onto the resinous heap, a sudden change occurred. More than twenty believers wielding candlesticks rushed from the church cellar. Leading them was the baker Ivan, actually holding an infant in swaddling clothes. 'Burn!' he roared, thrusting the baby towards the flames. 'Burn this child too!' Yanorò's lieutenant instinctively nocked an arrow but was stayed by his commander. 'Bring me my cloak.' He dismounted and parted the burning wool blankets with bare hands. Sparks scorched the sable cloak; the crowd's curses gradually subsided. 'Three years ago, during the famine,' Yanorò took the infant, letting it tug at his blood-stained braid, 'it was the Bogomil monks who opened the granaries and saved Novgorod.' He pointed at the pale-faced Maxim. 'And what was this saint doing then? Busy forging a golden chalice!' Ivan suddenly fell to his knees, pulling half a moldy black loaf from his robes—the very relief bread distributed by the Romani back then. The fire-scene fell into dead silence, pierced only by the infant's wail. 'Now,' Yanorò returned the child to its trembling mother, 'who else wishes to perform martyrdom?'\n\nThe church was reduced to scorched earth by dawn, but the gilded icon of the Virgin on the altar remained intact—Yanorò's personal guard had spent the night dousing it with water.

However, such divination activities were typically small-scale and individual, never before had there been a major divination conducted for the state. None knew whether it was because such things were uncontrollable, or because tarot cards simply could not grasp the fate of a nation. Yet, this never quelled the curiosity of some; there were always those who tried to touch the untouchable. Until one day, the Paramount King decided to initiate this state-directed divination project to glimpse the fate of the nation and himself. This was an unprecedented endeavor, and as there were no such taboos in divination culture and the cost was minimal, the proposal was swiftly approved by the ministers. Domria at that time was in a period of rapid ascension. Its power was so great that it brought pride to every clansman, whether abroad or at home, and it seemed as if this ascent was endless. Thus, everyone was brimming with confidence to see the divination's results, eager to witness its spectacle.\n\nYet, while it was said no one had done it before and it appeared to carry little risk, the Paramount King still feared unforeseen consequences. So, one night, he summoned the foremost diviner in the palace for guidance. This diviner was a young woman, her eyes clear yet holding a glimmer of still-unripe wisdom.\n\n'My dear Paramount King,' the diviner paused, then spoke with some unease, 'the fate divination reveals is merely a general direction we are likely to follow. You must not take it as an absolute outcome, for destiny's result is also shaped by human action...' She answered humbly, lowering her head as if pondering her next move.\n\n'If you are trying to preemptively excuse the outcome, it's unnecessary,' the Paramount King smiled. 'But I believe this will surely yield a favorable omen. What fate decrees will ultimately come to pass. Regardless of what final form your divination for us takes, it will be so.'\n\nHearing these words, the diviner let out a relieved sigh. 'I have already calculated that the optimal date for the divination is three days from now. On that day, you will surely witness the pinnacle to which our great nation is destined to ascend!' The diviner raised her arm in a cheer, projecting an air of full confidence, then turned and walked towards the palace depths. She left the Absolute Paramount King alone. He gazed up at the stars in the sky, yet saw only profound darkness with a few tiny, sand-like stars sprinkled within—much like the inscrutable depths of fate itself."

Suddenly, his furrowed brow relaxed, followed by a gentle smile, whether to ease the tension or to express goodwill, none could tell. He then turned to the audience and declared: 'Today is a day of great significance, perhaps one worthy of inscription in our people's annals. We shall bear witness to the eternity of our nation, just like the undying sun!' This was met with thunderous applause. Yet behind the applause, the female diviner trembled like a sieve. She knew that if what she revealed today failed to satisfy, it might very well draw a final period on her life... A calm inquiry then interrupted her daze. 'Let us begin, dear minister.'\n\n'Yes, Your Majesty, the Paramount King.' Trembling as if on the edge of an abyss, she produced the deck of tarot cards she handled most frequently. But her hand disobeyed, shaking violently, and the cards spilled onto the floor. The diviner turned ashen with fright, muttering incessantly. Though the Paramount King frowned, he said nothing. Then, lifting his head, he called out loudly to the diviner: 'The era we now enjoy is bestowed by the grace of the Lord above. Today, let us use these cards in hand to seek the fate and direction He guides us towards!' Seeing this, the diviner hastily gathered all the cards from the floor, shuffled them with lightning speed, and the still-intrigued Paramount King proceeded to cut the deck, selecting three cards to lay out in a spread. It was a simple three-card choice spread, meaning among these three, one surely held the fate. The nobles and royals below watched with bated breath, none noticing the raging storm outside.\n\nBoom— A bolt of lightning, like a sword of light, split the pitch-black night sky, striking the palace dome with precision. The sudden thunderclap and the damaged dome caused an uproar among the surrounding spectators. Yet the badly shaken Paramount King remained undeterred. After swallowing hard, he approached the table beneath the dome again, attempting to draw one of the now-dampened three cards.\n\nBut the howling gale seemed to wait for no one. It gathered force, shattered the window's restraint, and swept all twenty-one Major Arcana cards onto the floor. Yet the cards arranged themselves on the ground into a large circle, not scattered in the least by the wind. Before the Paramount King could ponder this strange phenomenon, another bolt of lightning struck, hitting the female diviner who had already collapsed on the floor in terror. Following her scream, a fire ignited by the lightning raced across the carpet, nearly consuming all twenty-one cards in flames. The Paramount King was finally afraid. He hurriedly moved away from under the dome and fled swiftly towards the entrance. At that moment, a single card, for reasons unknown, flew before his eyes. He froze, focusing his gaze: it depicted a fully armored knight holding a black banner, mounted on a white horse. It was card number 13—Death. And in his mind, a puzzling phrase seemed to echo: 'The god within the card is now released. The omen descends, and the world falls into chaos.' Then, that 13th card was carried by the wind into the fire, as if it had never existed."

First, there were various cases of ethnic discrimination against the dominant Romani people among the populace, followed by a series of 'colorful' natural disasters. It was as if all misfortune had concentrated its outbreak within these few years. Those in the know about the divination immediately erupted in uproar, vociferously blaming the Paramount King's actions years prior for bringing misfortune upon the entire nation. Stimulated by the spreading rumors, the Paramount King finally lost patience and, in a fit of rage, ordered all those wagging their tongues indiscriminately thrown into prison. The clamor on the surface was silenced by a heavy hand, but the undercurrents in the shadows began to stir. This absurd divination seemed to have stretched everyone's nerves taut, binding them to the state. Countless people seized this opportunity to label those they disliked as calamities foretold by the divination. People exploited this to purge dissidents on a grand scale. The intrigue and deceit seen only in theatrical works were now genuinely unfolding beside every individual. Multitudes perished due to wrongful convictions and false charges; the mortal realm was becoming a purgatory of suffering.\n\nYet, the unbelieving Paramount King privately sought out a new diviner and commanded another divination. Though the diviner adamantly refused, unwilling to engage in such matters again, he ultimately acquiesced under the temptation of money and the threat of steel. The diviner deftly shuffled the cards, the Paramount King cut the deck, and finally, the once-familiar three-card choice spread was laid out. Gritting his teeth, the Paramount King drew the card he sought. When he saw the card in his hand, fear chilled him to the bone. It was the one he knew all too well—card number 13, Death.\n\nUpon seeing Death's cold, seemingly mocking face, rage flared in his heart. He slammed the table fiercely, startling the diviner into bowing his head in apology. But the Paramount King did not blame him. Instead, doggedly, he performed divination after divination, changing the spread again and again. Without exception, the result remained the 13th card.\n\nThe Paramount King abruptly stood up and stormed out, slamming the door behind him. The diviner intended to call after him but ultimately held his tongue. Walking along the palace corridor, the Paramount King cursed incessantly: 'To hell with fate! If my destiny is truly death, then I shall see what this so-called Death can bring me!' And at that moment, a familiar phrase echoed once more in his mind:"

Then, he abruptly threw the hat into the air, and in an instant, it erupted with dazzling light and strange, brilliant colors.\n\nSimultaneously, a thunderous explosion sounded from a location several hundred meters behind the stage.

Agnes came from a noble family and had been sent to the monastery in her youth, her family expecting her to lead a holy life under God's guidance. However, as time passed, certain traits of Agnes gradually emerged, bringing unforeseen disaster to the monastery and even the entire nation.\n\nAgnes's extreme ignorance also affected others. She knew nothing of the world beyond the monastery walls and had no interest in it. In her perception, God's will was everything, yet her understanding of that will was narrow and one-sided. She rejected any new ideas or concepts, deeming them sacrilegious. When missionaries brought news and knowledge of changes in the outside world, she not only turned them away but also preached within the monastery about the dangers of these new ideas, instilling fear and rejection of the outside world in the other nuns.\n\nAs time went on, Agnes's greed also began to surface. She started coveting the monastery's wealth and lands, using her position to appropriate resources meant for aiding the poor. She secretly colluded with certain nobles, attempting to expand the monastery's sphere of influence to satisfy her own lust for power. Under her manipulation, the monastery's lands continuously expanded, while surrounding peasants lost the land they depended on for survival, plunging into hardship.\n\nAs Agnes's actions grew more egregious, voices of opposition arose within the monastery. Conscientious nuns, dissatisfied with her conduct, tried to persuade her to change, but faced severe repression. Left with no choice, these nuns reported Agnes's crimes.\n\nWhen the Paramount King learned of this, he was greatly shocked. He realized Agnes's actions had severely impacted the nation's stability and development. Thus, he ordered an investigation into Agnes and made her crimes public. Ultimately, Agnes received her due punishment: she was stripped of her status as a nun and expelled from the monastery.\n\nHowever, the wounds Agnes inflicted upon Domria were difficult to heal. The monastery's charitable works suffered a severe blow, leaving many poor without hope; the nation's economy was affected by the monastery's land expansion and resource wastage. Even more tragically, all this had intensified and become hard to stop.\n\nThe reflection of God has already cast the nation into infinite darkness."

After becoming Empress, this pride spun completely out of control, transforming into staggering indulgence. She believed she deserved all the world's pleasures, utterly disregarding the nation's plight and the people's lives.\n\nThe court became her stage for extravagance. She ordered the construction of opulent palaces, their walls inlaid with precious gems, floors laid with rare woods from distant lands. Her wardrobe overflowed with priceless robes, each crafted over months by master tailors, adorned with pearls and gold thread, their luxury breathtaking. For every outing, she required a vast procession, carriages decked in splendor, the dust raised in her wake seeming to carry an air of profligacy.\n\nIn pursuit of pleasure, her demands reached new heights. Grand banquets were held frequently, featuring delicacies rare in the world, exotic ingredients gathered from across the nation and distant countries. Fine wine flowed like water; the cost of a single feast could sustain countless ordinary families for years. To satisfy her palate, she demanded the imperial kitchens constantly devise novel dishes, flying into rages at the slightest displeasure, discarding countless delicacies without a thought.\n\nHer jealousy burned like a fierce fire, once ignited, hard to extinguish. The slightest favor the Paramount King showed other concubines would set her ablaze with envy. Using her authority as Empress, she framed these women, banishing them to the cold palace to spend their remaining days in loneliness and despair. She also sent agents to closely monitor the King's every move; any woman who might grow close to him became a thorn in her side to be removed.\n\nHer possessiveness extended beyond monopolizing the Paramount King; she also coveted the nation's rare treasures and resources. She hoarded vast wealth for herself, hidden deep within the palace, causing significant drainage of the state's treasury and creating unsustainable deficits. To fill the financial holes left by her extravagance, the court was forced to increase taxes, plunging the common people into misery.\n\nUnder the Empress's reckless behavior, Domria sank into severe crisis. Economically, commerce withered, the people suffered, and discontent with the court grew daily. Politically, the court was filled with apprehension, ministers neglected their duties, and state decisions became chaotic. Diplomatically, with national power waning, neighboring states watched with predatory intent, and border conflicts erupted incessantly.

Bogomilism advocated a simple, pure way of life, emphasizing inner cultivation and discernment between good and evil. Followers supported each other in daily life, treating one another with peace and kindness.\n\nFar away in Rome, the Pope of Catholicism wielded immense power and prestige. Catholicism spread widely across the European continent, and the Pope was dedicated to bringing all regions under the Catholic faith's domain. Upon learning that Domria followed Bogomilism, which differed significantly from Catholic doctrine, he perceived it as a challenge to Catholic authority.\n\nThe Pope dispatched missionaries who arrived in Domria with a forceful stance, demanding the Romani abandon their Bogomil faith and convert to Catholicism. The Romani, steadfast in their beliefs, having followed Bogomil teachings for generations and living in peaceful contentment, naturally resisted such a change. This response thoroughly enraged the Pope.\n\nThe Pope began to pressure Domria, not only criticizing Bogomilism on a religious level but also allying with neighboring Catholic states to impose an economic blockade on Domria. This worsened Domria's trade, already suffering from earlier disasters.\n\nDomria's rulers found themselves in a dilemma. On one hand, they had to uphold their Romani people's religious freedom and could not easily concede; on the other, they had to counter immense external pressure to ensure national stability. But as the situation deteriorated, internal conflicts arising from economic problems led to social disorder.\n\nThe Romani were incensed by the Pope's overbearing actions. They organized large-scale protests, expressing their commitment to their faith and resentment against external interference. These protests further intensified tensions between Domria and the Catholic powers.\n\nIn this dispute over faith, Domria's national interests suffered severely. Its once-prosperous commerce declined, the people endured hardship, and internal divisions emerged over how to handle the crisis. The Romani, as a crucial group within Domria, while true their faith, also had to bear the pain of national turmoil. This conflict, ignited by religious belief, escalated from a clash over Romani faith to a political and economic crisis at the state level, plunging Domria into an unprecedented dilemma.\n\nAnd in the capital's church, a crucifix quietly fell to the floor, shattering into pieces."

Esmeralda possessed a nightingale's voice; her singing could gentle the wildest winds. They shared their hearts under moonlight, danced by campfires, the sweetness of their love filling them with dreams of the future, yearning to build a warm little family, finding their own balance between wandering and settling down.\n\nHowever, the severe crisis facing Domria continually troubled the hearts of this couple. As the situation worsened, the shadow of rebellion swiftly descended. As a man, Aleksandr was naturally conscripted into the Paramount King's forces to suppress the rebellious populace. Before departing, he held Esmeralda tightly, promising to return safely.\n\nAt home, Esmeralda prayed for Aleksandr while striving to aid the elderly, weak, sick, and young in the tribe. But the cruelty of war exceeded imagination. Supplies grew short, disease ran rampant, and her own life fell into hardship. More heartbreaking were the increasingly dire reports from the front; Aleksandr's unit suffered heavy casualties.\n\nFinally, after a brutal battle, Aleksandr, gravely wounded, was brought home. Seeing her beloved on the brink of death, Esmeralda was consumed by grief. She stayed by Aleksandr's side, tending to him day and night, yet could not halt the ebbing of life. In his final moments, Aleksandr looked at Esmeralda, his eyes filled with reluctance and longing. Summoning his last ounce of strength, he told her to live on.\n\nAleksandr's death pierced Esmeralda's heart like a sharp blade. And Domria itself teetered on the brink under relentless assault. The once-vibrant nation became dilapidated, its people displaced, its cultural heritage facing extinction. Gazing upon this scarred land, Esmeralda's pain and despair reached their peak.\n\nShe understood deeply that she had lost not only her beloved, but the nation's peace and hope. In this war, countless lovers like them were forced apart, countless families shattered. The Romani romance and freedom, tempered by the fires of war, gradually turned into sorrowful memories.\n\nClutching Aleksandr's belongings, Esmeralda stood upon the ruins that once echoed with laughter, tears streaming down her face. Her songs were no longer joyful but filled with mourning for lost love and lament for the nation's fate.

Mainstream knowledge was controlled by authoritative scholars, and any voice of challenge was branded heresy and ruthlessly suppressed.\n\nIn ancient texts, Albert discovered a novel agricultural cultivation method. If implemented, it might solve the nation's famine. Overjoyed, he shared his findings with those around him, only to be met with a cold dismissal. Friends urged him: 'The King supports the current agricultural model, and the authoritative scholars have deemed it optimal. Don't invite trouble.'

Yet, in the end, the King chose to trust the authorities, rejected his proposal, and even issued an order forbidding further discussion on the matter.\n\nAlbert was filled with despair, powerless to change anything.

The people of Constantinople were filled with sorrow; this edifice, symbolizing the city's history and culture, had vanished just like that, in lightning and fire."

The smoke of war spread indiscriminately, rendering fertile fields barren; the economic edifice collapsed like rotten timber. The people's eyes were filled with despair, their dreams for the future ground to dust.\n\nAs night fell, the sky over Domria was not entirely shrouded in darkness. Stubborn pinpricks of starlight twinkled high above, cold and bright, like embers of hope inlaid upon the night's canvas. A young farmer named Erik, on a weary night after his labors, chanced to look up at the stars. Their brilliant light pierced straight into his shadowed heart. He recalled an ancient tale told by elders in his childhood: stars are fragments of hope scattered by the gods; as long as one holds faith, one can find the way forward.\n\nA faint glimmer kindled in Erik's heart. He decided not to wait passively. The next morning, he went from village to village, sharing his starlit epiphany with neighbors, urging everyone to unite and seek a path to rebuild their homes. Initially, voices of doubt and hesitation were many, but Erik did not give up. His sincerity and resolve moved more and more people.\n\nSoon, inspired by Erik, forces for action stirred in every corner of Domria. Scholars gathered in ancient libraries, seeking wisdom for development within yellowed texts; artisans took up tools again, mending damaged houses and crafting practical farming implements; young warriors set out on journeys to explore unknown resources in distant lands.\n\nThroughout this arduous process, the stars remained their guide. Whenever people felt lost in hardship, looking up at the starry sky would stir a surge of strength within them—a longing for a better life, a firm belief in the future. They also gradually understood that even so-called divination was merely a human creation. People themselves were the force that determined everything."

People's lives were peaceful and content, and they held a deep reverence and gratitude for the sun.\n\nBut from some unknown point, a dreadful drought descended silently. The sun seemed possessed by a demon, turning violent and merciless. It hung high in the sky, unleashing scorching rays that baked the earth until it cracked. Rivers dried up, revealing their stark, menacing beds; once emerald fields were left with only withered, yellowed stalks swaying helplessly in the hot wind; fruit trees in orchards shed curled, falling leaves, their fruits shriveling before ripening.\n\nAs the drought persisted, grain yields plummeted, and the people faced the threat of famine. Desperate for water, they were forced to trek long distances; many collapsed along the way from thirst and exhaustion. People began to complain; their reverence for the sun gradually turned to fear and resentment. They could not understand why the former benefactor had become a destroyer.\n\nNo one knew that the Paramount King, standing beneath the blazing sun at that moment, closed his eyes to feel its heat and murmured to himself:"

These ill-intentioned states, sharpening their blades, harbor ambitions to fully conquer and annex Domria, swallowing it whole into their territories.\n\nAfter enduring prolonged internal turmoil, Domria has been severely weakened. The once-steady stream of soldiers has greatly diminished, and the army's combat effectiveness has declined significantly. The populace, moreover, is thoroughly weary of large-scale strife and chaos. The courage, prowess, and formidable strength our Romani people once displayed while sweeping across Europe and conquering nations have long vanished into the dust of history.\n\nIt is easily imagined that when the iron hooves of so-called 'righteous judgment' come trampling down mercilessly, a pall of fear instantly envelops the entire nation, filling every heart with dread and unease. At this critical juncture of survival, the Paramount King decided to step forward, determined to personally reorganize the army and restore its former might.\n\nBut who could have foreseen that the blade which should have pointed at external foes would ultimately plunge deep into his own nation's heart? A series of extreme measures, far from saving Domria, wrought unprecedented havoc upon the nation's military structure.

The once-sluggish economy revived under a series of forceful measures; markets gradually recovered, and commercial activity flourished anew. Those foreign enemies coveting Domria were shattered under resolute blows, and the borders returned to peace.\n\nThe world of Domria seemed reborn, once again brimming with infinite possibilities. Though disasters still occurred frequently, like an invisible chain tightly encircling this nation of the poor and the wanderers, this was both a new cycle and a phoenix-like rebirth after 'Judgement.'

Withered yellow weeds struggled stubbornly within the dry crevices, as if silently recounting the suffering this land had endured.\n\nUpon a hilltop, the Paramount King sat astride a sturdy steed, gazing down upon the scarred landscape, his heart filled with a tumult of emotions. Looking back over the past few years, the land under his rule had been shadowed by disaster, both natural and man-made. Torrential rains and rampant floods had submerged countless villages; relentless heat had baked the earth dry, leaving fields barren without harvest. Yet what pained him most was the ugliness of human nature exposed in the face of these calamities.\n\nSome had exploited the disasters, hoarding and profiteering from the nation's plight; others, fleeing the catastrophes, had abandoned the elderly, weak, and infirm along their journey; still others, fighting over limited resources, had resorted to violence, even sparking large-scale conflicts. These actions were like sharp blades, deepening the wounds of natural disaster and hastening its spread. These varied evils intertwined, ultimately weaving a dense web of man-made misfortune that trapped everyone on this land, becoming a heavy shackle.\n\nBut the Paramount King was not defeated by these successive trials. He knew deeply he bore the responsibility of saving this land and its people. After enduring countless hardships and perils, the Paramount King had finally reclaimed victory, steering the nation back onto the right course.\n\nJust as he was filled with joy and envisioning a bright future for the nation, the young, new diviner approached hesitantly. The diviner's demeanor seemed awkward, as if harboring something difficult to say. Looking at him, the Paramount King offered a gentle smile and said, 'What brings you to me? Or do you wish to tell me something about the previous divination?'\n\n'Yes,' the diviner nodded slightly. 'In truth, you have long been angry and fearful about drawing the Death card, but I never had the chance to explain its full meaning. Just as I intended to tell you, you stormed out. In Tarot, Death is the arbiter of endings. While its appearance is accompanied by death and conclusion, it holds another meaning: it heralds rebirth. So-called Death is merely a necessary state we must pass through.' Having spoken, the diviner offered an awkward smile, as if a great weight had finally lifted from his heart, bringing a long-awaited relief.\n\nWhen he lifted his head and looked at the Paramount King, he found the ruler also wore an expression of ease. Their gazes met, and they smiled at one another. At that moment, a gentle breeze stirred, and the weeds beneath their feet began to sprout tenaciously from the cracked soil. Tender green shoots shimmered with vitality under the sunlight. This new growth was like the nation itself, poised for rebirth from the ashes, brimming with boundless hope."

The defenders noticed nothing amiss—seven consecutive days of feigned assaults had exhausted their vigilance.\n\nAt the third hour past midnight, the astrologer gave the signal, a cry mimicking an owl. Three hundred Romani craftsmen suddenly rose from the ice, pouring hot oil into the stone crevices of the wall. The intense cold instantly congealed the oil into fragile, web-like layers. Catapults then launched volleys of tar-coated clay pots. As flames erupted, the wall crumbled like sugar.\n\nThe masterstroke lay hidden among the refugees. Romani performers who had infiltrated the city three days prior now played the 'Rhapsody of Migration' in the cathedral square, throwing the defenders' command system into confusion. When the Orthodox Patriarch attempted to sound the alarm bell, he found the clapper had been replaced with a hollow copper tube—its toll a full octave lower than usual.\n\nAt dawn, Yanorò crossed the cracking ice of the moat into the city. He did not head straight for the palace. Instead, he entered the ruined Golden Gate occupied by displaced people and threw the keys to the noble granaries to a trembling baker: 'Bake twenty baskets of rye bread and distribute it to all the people.'\n\nAs the midday sun pierced the broken dome of the great cathedral, the last resisters laid down their arms. They saw Yanorò's war banner planted not on the castle, but atop the granary—its pole was the Patriarch's missing gilded staff, its tip hanging a string of moldy keys, the secret keys used by generations of Kiev's rulers to seal away famine archives."

'Only the hand of God may touch this thousand-year legacy...'\n\nYanorò suddenly turned, his cloak sweeping over and overturning the silver vessel containing holy oil. He seized the crown and, to everyone's gasp, placed the gem-studded diadem firmly upon his own head.\n\nThe Patriarch, first startled by Yanorò's action, recoiled several steps. Then, veins bulged on his forehead, betraying his fury. He wanted to curse, but Yanorò's eagle-sharp gaze stopped him, leaving only the sound of ragged breaths.\n\nWhen Yanorò turned around, the assembly saw a rough circlet covered in battle scars. Yanorò picked up the 'Golden Codex' lying at the Patriarch's feet, tore its pages, and stuffed them into the crown's inner lining: 'Now it holds the old order, crushed.'\n\nThe most astonishing act came last. The diviner Carmen brought forth an astrolabe. Yanorò cut his palm with a dagger, letting his blood drip onto the constellation of the Pleiades. The blood wound through the bronze grooves, finally gathering into a ruby-like clot. 'From this night forward,' he raised the blood-stained crown high, 'the tracks of the Romani shall be the new law!'"

The Muscovites believed the harsh winter would drive the enemy back, unaware the Romani warriors had already donned fur coats, ready to endure the season with them.\n\nThe assault began with an accident. Yanorò's scouts discovered the defenders poured boiling wastewater down the walls daily to prevent ice-climbing. So, Romani craftsmen worked through the night to forge hundreds of hollow iron spheres, filled with frozen fish and grease. At dawn, they launched these spheres into the city with catapults.\n\nThe midday sun thawed the frozen fish inside the spheres, and grease seeped into the drainage channels. When the defenders next poured hot water, a section of the wall suddenly erupted in eerie blue flames—the grease, splashed by boiling water, ignited on contact with fire. In the blaze, ice in the stone crevices melted, loosening the bricks.\n\nYet the true attack came from below. Wanderer-faction miners had tunneled through Moscow's ancient salt mines, emerging from beneath the Red Square fountain. They did not raise swords but rang the church bells, their peals infused with the melodies of Romani folk songs. In the confusion, the defenders, believing the city breached, abandoned the gates in panic.\n\nWhen Yanorò entered the city, the Tsar of Moscow was still warming himself by the fire in the Winter Palace. Before him sat an untouched honey cake—'tribute' from a Romani caravan three days prior, laced with a mild laxative. When guards reported the gates lost, the Tsar was clutching his stomach, rushing to the privy.\n\nThe day after the city fell, Yanorò ordered the walls dismantled, the stone used to build public bathhouses.

A cold wind carrying the scent of gunpowder swept across the square, unable to disperse the fervent gazes of the crowd—soldiers leaning on bloodied spears, peasants clutching blunted sickles, women holding sleeping children, all their faces lit by the flickering light of bonfires.\n\n'A year ago,' his voice was not loud, but rumbled like thunder over frozen earth, 'you and I rose against that tyrant Vladimir's oppression, placing this heavy burden upon a man of little talent. But have we found peace since I took this seat?' A low murmur stirred through the crowd. A few veterans wiped their faces, moisture glinting between their fingers.\n\nYanorò unfastened the dagger missing its ruby from his waist. Its point aimed eastward: 'Now, we have our walls, our river crossings, even Vladimir's golden crown—' He suddenly plunged the dagger into a wooden barrel beside him, honey gushing from the split, 'But our Romani children still beg like stray dogs at the back doors of others' kitchens!'\n\nA gaunt boy emerged from the crowd, crouching to lick the honey from the ground. Yanorò scooped him up, holding him high over his shoulder: 'Look at this child! His grandfather bled for princes, his mother spun thread for great merchants—yet has his stomach ever known a full meal?'\n\nThe square fell deathly silent for a moment, then erupted in a tsunami of roars. The blacksmith Vasily swung his hammer against the ground: 'Fight our way out! Fight to where we can set our own taxes!'\n\nYanorò returned the boy to his weeping mother and pulled a mottled parchment map from his robes. As the wind unfurled it, people saw the charcoal-drawn route: along the northern Black Sea coast, through the Caucasus passes, straight to the warm-water ports of the Persian Gulf.\n\n'I know what you fear,' he tore a corner from the map, lit it, and threw it into the fire. 'You fear dying in a foreign land, your bones lost.' The smell of scorched parchment filled the air. 'But you should fear more—that our grandchildren will still kneel for a bowl of cold soup!'\n\nHe kicked over the barrel; the remaining honey formed a golden river on the snow: 'At sunrise tomorrow, the wheels turn east! Those willing to follow, bring your pots and pans—we go not to conquer, but to gather the Romani hearths scattered across the seas and piece together a whole home again!'\n\nThat night, three hundred modified war chariots formed ranks outside the walls. Their axles bore not only weapons but also wheat seeds, looms, and cast-iron cradles. An old veteran cut silk captured from Turov's harem into wagon covers. Grinning at scoffing comrades, he said: 'What? Fit for a prince's bride, but not for my daughter?'\n\nBefore dawn, Yanorò found a pile of objects by the old palace fountain—jeweled daggers, silver chalices, even a few noblemen's hats. Beneath each item lay a note; the newest read: 'For our brothers in the east, to trade for land where roots can take hold.'\n\nHe bent to pick up a copper coin that had rolled to his feet.

Crystallized salt grains glittered under the scorching sun, as if the Theodosian Walls were clad in diamond armor. 'Romani wheels,' he licked his cracked lips, 'fear corrosion most.'\n\nYanorò's vanguard suffered a heavy blow at dawn. Twenty war chariots had just neared the walls when their iron-shod wheels jammed with salt. Bulgarian archers rained down coarse salt mixed with iron filings from the battlements; warhorses breathed it in, their muzzles bleeding. 'They've poisoned the walls!' The army surgeon cut open a dead horse's stomach—it was full of barbed salt crystals.\n\nThe turning point came on a stifling, humid midnight. Yanorò's scouts discovered that Bulgarian salt transport ships always ran aground at low tide. Three hundred Romani craftsmen slipped into the mudflats, crafting dragnets from whalebone and cables. When the next day's salt ship stuck fast again, hidden winches suddenly strained—the entire cargo of salt sacks capsized, revealing smuggled wine casks hidden below.\n\n'So even Constantine's warriors need solace,' Yanorò poured the wine into the Golden Horn before the captives' eyes. The crimson liquid lapped against the walls with the tide; the defenders watched the frothing wine on the sea's surface, their throats moving involuntarily.\n\nOn the day of the final assault, Yanorò played a cruel trick. He had soldiers push empty chariots in a feigned attack, each wagon laden with honey-soaked wool. The Bulgarians, as usual, poured down their salt rain, only to find the wool had absorbed the moisture and swelled, blocking the salt. By the time the defenders realized the ruse, the true siege towers, concealed behind the wool-laden chariots, were already flush against the wall.\n\nConstantine drew his sword and fell upon it before the burning granaries. The blade reflected a final, strange sight: the Romani were using captured salt sacks to repair the roads. Snow-white salt grains filled the wheel ruts, as if the earth itself had grown bones."

They softened limestone joints with vinegar and poured beeswax into the cracks. At dawn, the scorching sun melted the wax into a scalding fluid. The ancient water conduit, buckling from thermal expansion and contraction, ruptured, bringing down the southwestern corner tower of Castel Sant'Angelo with it.\n\nWhile the Pope burned incense in prayer at the Sistine Chapel, water suddenly seeped through the altar—the Romani had connected the Tiber to the catacombs. When the Swiss Guard discovered the bronze statue of St. Peter smeared with honey, thousands of wasps swarmed into the church through shattered stained-glass windows.\n\n'Heretics! This is sacrilege!' cardinals shrieked, swatting at the wasps on their robes. Meanwhile, Alfie stood beneath the obelisk in St. Peter's Square, directing soldiers to give water to heat-stricken prisoners using captured chalices. Two fleeing nuns hid behind the colonnade, watching Romani craftsmen making rubbings of mosaic frescoes.\n\nThe city fell at Trajan's Market.

Arrows wrapped in parchment pierced the walls; each sheet bore printed passages from the Bible: 'Render unto Caesar...'\n\nAt sunset, Alfie stepped over shattered stained glass into the Pantheon.

'No. We go through the Ardennes.'\n\nThe essence of Plan No. 17 lay in speed and deception. French light cavalry disguised as merchant caravans moved through forest paths under cover of darkness, while the main force advanced rapidly along the Meuse River. Domrian scouts were misled by deliberately leaked false intelligence, believing the French remained fixated on a coastal offensive.\n\nBy the time Alfie received the urgent frontline report, the French vanguard had already breached Namur. De Villars' artillery was positioned before dawn, its fire tearing through Domria's hastily constructed defenses.\n\n'They learn fast,' Alfie stared at the map, tracing the breached front line.\n\nBut Domria's army did not collapse. Romani light cavalry flanked from the sides, launching guerrilla attacks using the terrain, while musketeers pre-positioned near Liège sniped French officers from elevated positions. De Villars' momentum was forcibly slowed, and his supply lines stretched ever longer through the forest.\n\nFinally, on a sun-scorched plain, the main forces of both armies clashed. The French heavy infantry squares initially gained the upper hand, but Domria's artillery adjusted its trajectory at the critical moment, sweeping the battlefield with grapeshot.

In the clay bowl in his palm now were mixed silver grains from the Rhine, gold flecks from the Danube, dark magnetite from the Volga, and fragments of amber from the Baltic.\n\nThe coronation date was set for the autumn equinox. The Romani elders insisted on holding the ceremony in the Pantheon, for the Orion constellation newly inlaid in its bronze dome was the very navigation star map their ancestors had used crossing the Caucasus Mountains. Before dawn, three hundred weaponless wagons entered the Roman Forum, their beds piled with broken weapons gathered from across nations. Blacksmiths melted these swords and spears into three great pillars, representing Law, Trade, and the Right of Migration.\n\nWhen Alfie entered the Pantheon barefoot, the crowd gasped. He wore the same tattered cloak from his uprising twenty years prior, patched with thirty-seven fragments of different colors—each cut from the banners of the fallen. The bronze codex of Constantinople, the wing-feathers of Polish hussars, the Moorish patterns of Spain... all now bowed beneath his threadbare hem.\n\n'Your Majesty, accept the crown,' the Bogomil High Priest offered a diamond-studded golden diadem.\n\nSuddenly, a Venetian glassmaker's daughter ran forward. She held a model of the Orion constellation pieced together from church stained-glass fragments. 'Papa says the real stars belong to everyone,' the girl stood on tiptoe, placing the model in his hands.\n\nAs the midday sun shone through the dome's star chart, Alfie did something that shocked Europe. He summoned the deposed monarchs of various nations, having each cut a lock of hair to be woven into a cord. 'This is not humiliation,' he said, mixing his own graying hair into it. 'When my son inherits the throne, this cord shall be tied around his neck—if he proves less wise than any of you.'\n\nThe coronation's climax came at sunset. Twelve white horses pulled a massive wagon into the square, laden with soil gathered from Gibraltar to the Urals. Alfie grabbed a handful of earth mixed with blood and grain and cast it into the air: 'Before today, you were French, Rus, German... From this day forward, you are all People of the Wheel!'\n\nSuddenly, a sun shower began. Alfie unfastened his cloak and threw it to the crowd, revealing the hideous scars on his back—a conquest epic carved by Cossack sabers, French arrows, and Spanish muskets. People clamored to touch these scars as if touching a miracle.\n\nAs night fell, Alfie stood alone beneath the Pantheon's dome. He took out the chipped dagger he had carried for thirty years and scattered the collected metal grains into the ceremonial fire.

Andre himself carried a copper watering can, nourishing the young trees with water hauled from the Jordan River thirty miles away. 'Madmen!' the commander spat. 'Do they think olive branches can smash open city gates?'\n\nThat night, twelve Romani miners followed the dry underground river into the depths. They drilled fine holes into the bedrock of the Temple Mount, inserting flax ropes soaked in rose oil. At dawn, Andre lit the rope ends; a light fragrance, carried by the smoke, seeped into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the garrison praying at dawn fell to the ground, dazed.\n\n'This is not war,' Andre said, stepping over unconscious knights into the church. Under the midday sun, he did something that astonished the entire army—he ordered soldiers to melt captured armor into iron picks to repair the Stations of the Cross damaged by war. Jewish stonemasons, Arab plasterers, and Armenian painters were summoned to the square. Romani officers distributed silver-inlaid tools: 'Reinforce the crack in the wall at the Seventh Station with Damascus steel rivets.'\n\nWhen remnants of the Knights Templar retreated to the Dome of the Rock, they found its locks already melted away. Andre sat alone in the center of the hall, before him lay the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran, each weighed down by Jerusalem stone paperweights. 'Choose one,' he said to the sword-wielding knights. 'Recite your favorite passage. I vow not to harm the one who recites.'\n\nThe day after the city fell, Andre convened a council on the cliffs of Mount Zion. He produced a bloodstained brick from the city wall: 'During the garrison's final charge last night, this brick killed my messenger.' He then hurled the brick into the valley below. 'Now it shall be the raw material for seven hundred and thirty-nine new bricks—widen the steps of the Jaffa Gate to make the pilgrims' donkey carts pass more easily.'\n\nThe most astonishing order came at sunset: all Romani soldiers must lay down their weapons and walk the fourteen Stations of the Cross barefoot. 'When my left foot touched the crack in the stone at the Third Station,' an old veteran later recalled, 'I suddenly understood we had not conquered a city, but the source of all suffering.'\n\nAs the crescent moon climbed the spire of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Andre stood upon the ruins of Solomon's Temple. He pried the cross insignia from the armor of a fallen Knight Templar, mixing it with fresh soil from the Mount of Olives to cast a bronze bell. 'On the road back to Constantinople,' he told the scribe, 'hang one at each post station, to remind us that—'"
EDG_DMR_play.13.aa:0 "The evening breeze brushed the bronze bell, producing a clear chime."

EDG_DMR_play.14.t:0 "Gold and Wheels"
EDG_DMR_play.14.d:0 "In Yanorò's tent, the flame of a copper lamp cast wavering shadows on the ledger. Peter Razi's finger paused on a line of figures, the ink still wet.\n\n'Collect another thirty percent,' he said, his voice like a dulled blade. 'Otherwise the army will go hungry next month during the siege.' Yanorò didn't look up, continuing to polish the dagger missing its ruby—his father's sole legacy, its blade still stained with blood-rust from the uprising three years prior. 'Thirty percent?' he finally spoke, his tone as calm as a frozen river. 'Are you calculating for merchants or for the Romani?'\n\nPeter Razi's parchment was filled with numbers: charcoal costs for the smithy, axle wear for the chariots, compensation for fallen soldiers... each entry precise to two decimal places. He was a good merchant, even a genius—it was his 'salt and iron monopoly' system that kept the rebel army from starving in the first two years. But now, the ink on the ledger began to reek.\n\n'Do you know what's in our warehouse at the port of Caffa?' Peter Razi suddenly asked. 'Not grain, not weapons, but four hundred crates of Venetian glass beads.' He sneered. 'Those profiteers would rather trade beads for our wool than sell us a single grain of wheat.'\n\nYanorò's dagger tip lightly traced the ledger, slicing through a string of numbers. 'Then burn the warehouse.' 'Are you mad? That's our last bargaining chip for trade!' 'No,' Yanorò lifted his eyes. 'You've forgotten why we rose up.'\n\nThe sound of wheels crunching over gravel came from outside the tent. Peter Razi yanked open the tent flap—under moonlight, thirty large wagons were slowly leaving the camp, laden with silks and spices confiscated from the merchant guilds.\n\n'You... you robbed your own quartermaster?' 'I liberated them,' Yanorò sheathed his dagger at his waist. 'This morning I told the soldiers: either guard these goods and starve, or distribute them to villages along the way in exchange for a bowl of hot soup.'\n\nPeter Razi's ledger fell to the ground. He suddenly realized the man he had once played with was no longer the same. 'You'll ruin everything,' he rasped. 'Without rules, without contracts, how are we any different from bandits?'\n\nYanorò walked to the tent entrance. Beyond the lifted flap was a sky full of stars—the only ledger the Romani had known for millennia. 'Rules?' he said softly. 'Did the Grand Prince's cavalry speak of rules when they crushed my father's stall?'\n\nPeter Razi ultimately left with his ledger. Three months later, a charred account book was found in Constantinople. On its scorched pages, one line remained legible:"
EDG_DMR_play.14.aa:0 "'Some value cannot be calculated in numbers.'"

EDG_DMR_play.15.t:0 "Parting Ways"
EDG_DMR_play.15.d:0 "Peter Razi lifted the flap of Yanorò's tent before dawn.\n\nThe tent was unlit, only a copper Bogomil emblem resting on a low table, gleaming cold in the faint morning light. Yanorò sat in shadow, rubbing a coarse whetstone in his hand—the last unsold stone from his father's stall.\n\n'You sent troops to raid a caravan,' Peter Razi's voice seemed squeezed through clenched teeth. 'Not the enemy's caravan—our own.'\n\nYanorò did not deny it. Three days prior, he had ordered the interception of twelve wagons laden with grain and ironware—supplies Peter Razi had secretly negotiated for with Rhineland lords. The cargo wasn't sent to storehouses but distributed directly to starving villages along the route. 'That grain was collateral,' Peter Razi's knuckles rapped on the low table, causing the copper emblem to jump. 'What we promised the lords was a salt tax exemption for next quarter!' 'I know,' Yanorò finally spoke, gently placing the whetstone beside the emblem. 'And I know you privately promised them mining rights to three mountains—using Romani ancestral burial grounds as guarantee.'\n\nOutside the tent came the snort of a warhorse; the distant camp was awakening. Peter Razi suddenly laughed, pulling a scroll of parchment from his robe and unfurling it—covered in dense signatures and thumbprints.\n\n'A joint petition from seventy-two clan elders,' his fingertip tapped the topmost, faded blood-print. 'Even your father's sworn brother agreed. Without these supplies, we won't last the winter.'\n\nYanorò stared at that blood-print. He remembered the old man, a regular at his father's pottery stall, always trading three copper coins for a chipped clay pot, saying 'crickets can live in the cracks.' Now this man's blood was proof for a land deal. 'You are mistaken,' Yanorò stood, the whetstone leaving a red mark on his palm. 'We do not need to sell our ancestors' graves to survive winter—' He lifted the tent flap, and morning light flooded in like a deluge, '—we need them to remember that Romani wheels can roll over anyone's rules.'\n\nPeter Razi's face turned ashen in the light. He saw the scene outside: three hundred light cavalry stood ready, saddlebags holding oilcloth-wrapped fire-kits.\n\n'You're going to burn the mines?' his voice trembled for the first time. 'That's our last wealth!' 'No,' Yanorò mounted his horse. 'I'm going to burn every loan contract.'\n\nThat afternoon, seven columns of smoke rose along the Dnieper River. The acrid smell of burning parchment drifted into the lords' castles while Peter Razi's ledger turned to ashes in Yanorò's tent. On the last unburnt corner of a page, a line was faintly visible:\n\n'The merchant thinks the world is a ledger; the king knows the world is a whetstone.'\n\nPeter Razi left the camp at dusk, taking only a pure gold abacus. Some said he went to Venice; others claimed he built a salt mine on the border. But everyone remembered his parting words—"
EDG_DMR_play.15.aa:0 "'You've won the war, Yanorò, but who will count your spoils for you?'"

EDG_DMR_play.16.t:0 "The Return Journey of Salt and Ashes"
EDG_DMR_play.16.d:0 "Ten years later, Peter Razi's body was found in a salt mine by the Danube.\n\nHe was curled up at the dead end of the mine's deepest shaft, clutching the pure gold abacus he was never without. Most of the beads had been pried off long ago; the remaining three were strung on hemp around his emaciated neck—one engraved with 'Debt,' one with 'Profit,' the last smooth and new, bearing no inscription.\n\nThe mine walls were covered with scratches from fingernails, interspersed with rows of crooked numbers, like some desperate calculation. At his feet, a battered tin bowl held coarse salt; atop the salt pile rested a half-burnt scrap of parchment, a corner of that old mining contract still faintly discernible.\n\nHe had starved to death.\n\nBefore dying, this once immensely wealthy merchant used his last strength to carve migration route markers along every tunnel of the salt mine—not to guide the living, but to chart the most efficient paths for salt-hauling mules. When the search party raised their torches to illuminate his stiffened right hand, they found his fingers buried deep in the salt pile, his palm clutching a handful of coarse salt mixed with gold dust.\n\nIronic that on the very day he breathed his last, Yanorò issued the 'Salt and Iron Amnesty,' declaring all mines restored to communal tribal ownership. The herald reading the decree specifically mentioned that 'certain traitors' private salt wells would be converted into shelters for wandering children.'\n\nLater, a former apprentice who had kept accounts for Peter Razi discovered a diary hidden in a secret compartment among his belongings. The final page read:\n\n'In the end, I could not teach him that some accounts are settled with life itself.'\n\nWhen Yanorò received news of the death, he was polishing the dagger missing its ruby. He said nothing, but sent someone to melt Peter Razi's gold abacus into a bronze bell, hung beneath the weather vane at the mine entrance.\n\nWhenever the north wind blows, the miners say the bell's chime seems to be tallying some old account that can never be fully settled."
EDG_DMR_play.16.aa:0 "'Listen to the lament.'"

EDG_DMR_play.17.t:0 "Conversation at the Grave"
EDG_DMR_play.17.d:0 "The wind swept through the gorse, scattering dust from Yanorò's cloak.\n\nHe stood alone before the nameless grave. The headstone bore only a shallow relief of an abacus—no name, no date, just deep scratches like numbers forcefully crossed out in a ledger.\n\n'I burned the Constantinople tax register,' he spoke to the stone, his fingers tracing the missing third bead on the abacus. 'Our treasury now uses the double-entry bookkeeping you taught me years ago.'\n\nA lizard peeked from behind the stone, then quickly retreated into a crevice. In the distance came the clink of newly minted coins, as merchants unloaded goods at the market below the hill. Five years ago, these merchants held franchises signed by Peter Razi; now they used new coins bearing the wheel pattern, designed by Yanorò himself.\n\n'During the eastern campaign, I met your old Venetian friend,' he untied the wineskin at his waist and poured it over the grave. The liquid seeping into the earth sounded like a sigh. 'He said before you went to the salt mine, you entrusted him with a chest of ledgers.'\n\nThe wind suddenly grew stronger, lifting a corner of his cloak to reveal the densely patched lining—one patch of indigo silk was the very fabric Peter Razi had often worn.\n\n'I looked through those ledgers...' Yanorò's voice grew hoarse. 'The last three pages were filled with my name, but what followed was not debt.'\n\nHe suddenly knelt on one knee, the sound of his dagger plunging into the earth startling nearby larks. With a clang, the dagger missing its ruby was pressed atop the headstone, its tip aligned with the abacus's central beam.\n\n'You calculated correctly,' he whispered to the empty valley. 'Without your abacus, I couldn't even divide the spoils evenly.'\n\nAs dusk began to swallow the tombstone's shadow, Yanorò drew a new bronze bell from his robes and gently hung it from a corner of the stone. The clapper was a pure gold bead, its inner side engraved with a tiny double-circle cross—the Bogomil mark for 'reunion in the afterlife.'\n\nWhen the night wind stirred the bell, he uttered a final phrase he had never spoken to the living:"
EDG_DMR_play.17.aa:0 "'May you be the Paramount King in the next life, and I shall be your chancellor.'"

EDG_DMR_play.18.t:0 "Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust"
EDG_DMR_play.18.d:0 "Snow fell on Yanorò's tombstone like a thin layer of salt.\n\nAlfie stood before the grave, his boot crushing a few frozen gorse plants. He had just returned from Michy's corpse, his armor still stained with his brother's blood—now dried, taking on a rust color similar to the bell on the headstone.\n\n'You taught us to hold a sword,' Alfie spoke to the stone, his breath forming white mist in the air. 'But you never taught us when to let go.'\n\nHe unfastened his sword and plunged it into the snow, hilt down. This was the Romani warrior's way of honoring the dead, signifying the laying down of killing. Yet as the blade entered the earth, Alfie found his hand still trembling—Michy's final expression had been too much like their father's, especially that stubborn curve of the mouth.\n\nA raven landed on the bronze bell; its clapper was frozen, unable to sound. Alfie remembered his father hanging this bell in his later years, saying he would 'listen to the wind to settle accounts.' Now it was mute, like Michy's severed throat.\n\n'He called your name until the end,' Alfie drew a blood-stained cloth from his robes, torn from Michy's inner garment. 'Do you think he called "Father" or "Tyrant"?'\n\nThe cloth burned on the snow, its flames illuminating the inscription on the back of the headstone—carved by Yanorò himself in life: 'Merchant, Warrior, Failed Father.' The flames suddenly leaped higher. Alfie saw his own shadow cast upon the stone, merging with those words.\n\nIn the distance came the sound of wheels. Newly minted coins were being transported to the treasury, bearing neither Yanorò's face nor Michy's emblem, only the cold, impersonal wheel pattern. Alfie suddenly understood why his father always polished that ruby-less dagger late at night—some voids cannot be filled by any conquest.\n\nThe snow fell heavier. Finally, Alfie removed his crown and placed it before the grave. Inside the gold circlet, a newly engraved line of small script was revealed:"
EDG_DMR_play.18.aa:0 "'May there be no throne in hell, where we three—father and sons—are but breaking bread together.'"

EDG_DMR_play.19.t:0 "Wind"
EDG_DMR_play.19.d:0 "Andre came to the cemetery on the first overcast day after the autumn equinox, holding a piece of Balkan rock salt in his left hand and a newly minted wheel-copper coin in his right.\n\nYanorò's tombstone was more austere than he had imagined. The rough granite bore only an embedded, rusting dagger, a spiderweb clinging where the hilt's ruby was missing. In contrast, scattered before Alfie's grave lay fragments of a shattered crown, years of rain having washed the gilding into rivulet patterns reminiscent of the straits on a map of Constantinople.\n\n'By lineage, I should call you Great-Uncle.' He placed the rock salt before Yanorò's stone. The salt block was carved with the old city emblem of Constantinople—a design from the tenure of his illegitimate father as mayor. 'You melted an abacus into a bell long ago. Now sea winds have corroded it through; I've had a new one cast.'\n\nThe coin was pressed into the damp earth before Alfie's grave. Andre remembered meeting this distant cousin when he was four or five: Alfie had lifted him atop a war chariot during an inspection of Constantinople to watch the sunset, the armor digging painfully into his ribs.\n\n'The night you burned the law codes, my father was destroying smuggling ledgers at the town hall.' He spoke to the void between the two tombstones, as if mediating a dispute that crossed life and death. 'The firelight revealed the courtesan portraits he had hidden in a secret chamber. That was the first time I learned a hero's descendant could also fear the light.'\n\nThe wind swept through the gorse, startling a blue butterfly resting on the dagger. Andre suddenly noticed a crack in Yanorò's tombstone base, half an old parchment wedged inside—Peter Razi's handwriting, listing the income and expenses of the salt mines burned years ago.\n\n'So you kept this.' He smiled faintly, recalling his father's drunken reminiscences: in his later years, Yanorò often searched through old papers alone in the archives, forbidding anyone from organizing them.\n\nAs dusk deepened, Andre drew a tin box from his robes. Inside was a transcription of the death register from the Great Plague of Constantinople, each page's margin adorned with patterns of intertwined wheels and abacus beads. He buried the box beside Alfie's grave, whispering as he covered it with soil:\n\n'We branches, pruned from the orthodox lineage, are perhaps best suited to record the tree rings.'\n\nThe last of his wine was poured between the two graves. The stain meandered like blood in the twilight but was soon swallowed by the earth. As Constantinople's new governor turned to leave, the bronze bell on the tombstone suddenly chimed without wind—the sound was not of metal striking, but of countless salt grains falling into a deep well."
EDG_DMR_play.19.aa:0 "And at that moment, the bell fell, silent and soundless."

EDG_DMR_play.20.t:0 "The Choice After Entering the City"
EDG_DMR_play.20.d:0 "The snow hadn't fully melted on the battlements of Kiev. Yanorò and Peter Razi climbed the fortress tower on creaking wooden planks.\n\n'This place is truly, unbearably cold,' Peter Razi breathed white mist, rubbing his reddened hands. 'Three grain cart axles froze and split yesterday.' Yanorò didn't reply, watching locals ice-fishing on the Dnieper River. A few children dragged fishing nets across the ice, their laughter echoing against the ruined walls.\n\n'About relocating the capital...' Peter Razi pulled a coarse loaf from his robe, broke it, and offered half to Yanorò. 'The Merchant Guild sends word they're willing to donate thirty thousand gold coins to build a palace.' Yanorò took a bite; rough wheat bran grated against his teeth. 'Tell them to melt the coins and forge new boots for the garrison—seven frostbitten toes among the west wall sentries.' Peter Razi fell silent for a moment, then drew a small clay pot from his satchel. 'Try this? Honey from a local beekeeper.' Golden syrup drizzled over the frozen bread, slowly seeping into its cracks.\n\n'The pigeons of Turov,' Yanorò suddenly said, 'always shat on the parliament roof in summer.' Peter Razi paused, then laughed. 'You still remember? The year your new robe was just...'\n\nThey laughed shoulder to shoulder, their white breaths mingling in the cold air. Below the tower, soldiers rushed past carrying a frostbitten comrade, leaving long trails in the snow. 'About relocating the capital,' Peter Razi wiped a tear from laughing, 'when do you want to discuss it?' Yanorò flicked the last honey-soaked breadcrumb to a crow on the river ice. The bird snatched it and flapped towards the charred mill on the opposite bank. 'See,' he turned to descend the stairs, 'even the crows know to find a warmer place for winter.'\n\nPeter Razi remained on the tower, turning the honey pot in his palm. The children's laughter on the ice rose again, blending with the creaking of the mill's weathervane. Looking down at Yanorò below, Peter shouted: 'So, what do you want to do?' Yanorò slowly turned his head and called back:"

Suddenly, as if realizing something, he held his hand out towards Yanorò and said: 'The Ecumenical Patriarch has softened his stance. If we publicly receive baptism, the Orthodox Patriarchs might help stabilize Lithuania for us.' Yanorò drew his dagger, toying with it idly as he spoke: 'Fine. We can add a couple of Orthodox invocations to our prayers—but about baptism, I'm not so sure.'\n\nThe potato cakes roasting over the fire began to smell burnt. The two silently shared the charred cakes; the firelight cast a bright sheen on the icons in the church. Peter suddenly pointed at the Virgin's hand. 'Is this icon crooked? The Virgin's left hand is a bit smaller than her right.' Yanorò also turned to look and chuckled. 'Like the hand you tremble with when counting on your abacus.'\n\nPeter sighed, then spoke slowly: 'I too don't believe it's right to betray our faith and invite eternal damnation for a bit of gain.' 'But my thoughts are not mine alone,' he shifted his tone. 'It all depends on you, Yanorò. What do you think?'\n\nYanorò gently stroked his chin, then opened his eyes with determination and said:"

EDG_DMR_play.24.t:0 "The Conflict Between Wanderers and Settlers"
EDG_DMR_play.24.d:0 "As early as the founding days of the Domrian Empire, the great Paramount King Yanorò skillfully fused Romani traditions with the commonalities of various settled peoples to create a new type of civilization. Yet beneath this seemingly harmonious facade lay a deep-seated conflict between the settled inhabitants across the land and the nomadic traditions of the Romani. In Domria's early years, due to its limited territory, these profound tensions did not erupt immediately.\n\nHowever, after over a century of accumulation, the compromise devised by Yanorò and others increasingly proved inadequate. Elder Romani from the original Turov Duchy and traditional nomadic Romani tribes from the steppes began committing numerous appalling acts across the ever-expanding territories, tearing down houses to make way for their wagons. These people would later be known in Domrian history as the Wanderer Faction. Opposing them was the Settler Faction, whose earliest members included Yanorò and Peter. They clearly understood that the Romani could not wander forever, nor could they forever abstain from agricultural production. Thus, they strongly advocated for Romani across the land to settle and integrate into local societies.\n\nIn the empire's early days, such conflicts could still be suppressed by strong rulers. But over time, as territories expanded and various peoples with different lifestyles were integrated under Romani rule, the popular bases of both factions grew. This ultimately erupted into a large-scale confrontation encompassing both the court and the common people by the mid-16th century. As letters and newspapers detailing the clashes flew like snowflakes into the empire's major cities, the scroll of a new crisis gradually unfurled in the long river of time.\n\nFaced with all this, what should we do?

EDG_DMR_play.25.d:0 "Alfie stood upon the walls of Stockholm. The icy north wind whipped snowflakes against his armor, producing a faint, pattering sound. He looked down at the conquered land beneath him—the forests, rivers, and city-states the Swedes once deemed inviolable were now trophies won by his sword.\n\nHe was never a ruler content with merely preserving what he had. He knew only what his father Yanorò had said: Domria needed sea ports, needed Baltic trade routes, and most importantly, needed to make the powers entrenched in the north understand who truly ruled this continent. Swedish resistance? Mere futile struggle. He remembered the siege of Vyborg Fortress, when Swedish nobles charged with ancient battle-axes, only to be mowed down in rows by the empire's musketeers. It wasn't that he was cruel; the times had changed, yet they still lived in dreams of the past.\n\nFootsteps approached from behind—his personal guard. 'Your Majesty, the roster for the northern provinces has been drafted.' Alfie did not turn, merely brushing snow from the battlement. 'Tell them, lighten the taxes and levies. Let those Swedish peasants see that following Domria is far better than following a royal house that merely clings to its ancestral holdings.'\n\nHe recalled the debates before the war. Some in the Senate said he was too rash, that those frozen northern lands weren't worth bloodshed. And now? Those same people were busy toasting at the victory banquet, praising his 'foresight and wisdom.' Alfie scoffed, his gaze sweeping over the distant frozen sea. This was just the beginning. He wanted Domria's banner planted on every inch of land from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\n\nAs for those Swedish remnants retreating into the mountain forests? Merely those in need of 'civilizing.' He had patience aplenty—using imperial law, the benefits of trade, even bonds of marriage—to gradually grind down their edges. One day, they would forget they were ever Swedish, remembering only that they were subjects of Domria.\n\nThe wind grew fiercer. Alfie tightened his cloak and turned to walk back into the city. The stone slabs beneath his feet still bore traces of war, but soon enough, Domrian statues would rise here, and imperial horns would sound. He knew how later generations would judge this war—aggressor? conqueror? Let them say what they will. He cared only that on Domria's map, another weighty piece of northern soil had been added. Then, he thought of how to secure this soil:"

The young men shoulder hunting rifles and disappear into the deep woods, saying they'll reclaim the wheat fields when the snow melts. But the women crouch beneath scorched eaves, weeping as they count tree rings—they know some things shatter, like winter ice that melts and can never be pieced back into its former shape.\n\nOccasionally, merchants return from the south, saying Domrian coins bear the face of Yanorò.

A Medici banker from Florence wrote in a secret missive: 'Their wheels not only crush crowns, but shake the very order we depend upon—the privileges of nobles, the authority of the Church, the monopolies of merchants, all tremble beneath the Romani slogans of "equality" and "freedom."'\n\nFrance and Britain seemed the first to respond. In Buckingham Palace and the Louvre, council chambers held tattered copies of the 'Wheel Codex.' Within its pages, clauses like 'Abolition of Serfdom,' 'Freedom of Trade,' and 'Equal Citizenship' were emphatically circled in red ink—dense, frantic circles, the desperate gestures of an anxious hand. For the first time in a century, they felt a deep, primal fear, the chaotic noise of crumbling material desires, all the more pronounced after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFrance and Britain used the Holy Roman Empire's calamity to wash the weariness and numbness from their faces. Foes who had torn at each other in the Hundred Years' War became beasts trapped in a cage of survival. These two beasts converged, signing a pact called the 'Secret Treaty of Paris.'

EDG_DMR_play.28.d:0 "Alfie stood atop the soaring spire of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, overlooking the tens of thousands gathered in the square below. The cold wind whipped his robes. He suddenly raised aloft the Golden Fleece, symbol of the Holy Roman Empire's highest honor—its gold flashed blindingly in the midday sun. But in Alfie's eyes now, there was only resolve. His arm muscles tensed; with all his strength, he hurled the heavy construct of gold and enamel down onto the cold flagstones! Then, his war-boot, caked with the dust of conquest, stomped down upon that centuries-old emblem of sin. A grating screech of metal and the brittle crack of shattering gems sent a shiver through the crowd. The once-supreme symbol twisted, deformed, and crumbled into dust beneath his heel.\n\n'Do you hear?!' Alfie's voice, amplified by a great copper horn, swept through the city like a storm. 'From this moment, the name "Holy Roman Empire"—shall be swept forever into the rubbish heap of history! How was it "Holy"? Its sceptre dripped with the blood of the innocent! How could it claim "Roman"? It long betrayed the oath of equality and never possessed Rome's glory! What kind of "Empire" was it? A cage that mercilessly trampled its own people, its ordinary folk!' Then, raising his arm high, he proclaimed the old empire's lands would be completely remade into twelve new provinces, governed by Domrian appointees under the new 'Wheel Codex.' 'Here!' his voice rang with finality. 'The chasm between noble and commoner shall be bridged! The divide between settler and wanderer shall be crushed!—If you embrace the Romani belief in your heart, wherever the wheel turns, you are a rightful citizen of the Empire!'\n\nHis words rolled like thunder. Instantly, the square erupted! Countless Romani waved banners bearing the golden wheel; liberated serfs wept with emotion; even many moved Austrian commoners raised their arms high. 'Long live Domria! Long live freedom!' A tsunami of sound surged skyward, shaking the ancient cathedral to its foundations."

EDG_DMR_play.30.d:0 "To His Majesty, the Paramount King Alfie:\n\nIn accordance with Your Sacred Decree, our Domrian legions launched the final assault upon Vienna in the early hours today. This fortress, cultivated for centuries by the House of Habsburg, has finally opened beneath the wheels of the Romani.\nOur main force, numbering over twenty thousand men, assembled on the left bank of the Danube, comprising six thousand charioteers, three thousand Bogomil monks forming the 'Holy Fire Battalion,' and light cavalry tribes from the Carpathian Mountains. The Viennese garrison numbered approximately eighteen thousand, primarily German mercenaries, who constructed three layers of defenses based on the city's stone walls and the Danube line. The western gate barbican and the fortifications around St. Stephen's Cathedral were the most formidable.\n\nThree days prior to the assault, our sappers secretly dug tunnels along the Danube ice, reaching the very foundations of the city walls. \nAt noon, our three prongs converged at the central city square. Only the garrison in St. Stephen's Cathedral held out stubbornly. The Archbishop led monks using holy icons as shields, defending the bell tower until we promised to preserve their religious rites, upon which they laid down their crosses and battle-axes. As of this report, our forces have eliminated over seven thousand enemy soldiers and captured ninety-six members of the Habsburg royal family and noble officials. We have seized thirty-three cannons, two thousand warhorses, and taken control of twelve granaries. Our casualties are approximately two thousand three hundred, mostly from arrow wounds during the breaching of the barbican and blade injuries from street fighting.\n\nOur army plans to hold the entry ceremony tomorrow. Sappers have begun repairing the breaches in the walls. We intend to preserve Vienna's blacksmith and baker guilds, having Romani craftsmen work alongside local masters to forge chariot parts. Merchant fleets on the Danube are docking; the first shipments bring rye seeds dispatched from Turov, to be distributed to farmers in the city's outskirts as you instructed.

The Holy Roman Empire's declaration of war lay within a courier's bag, its paper rustling softly as it knocked at the border post.\n\nIn the court at Vienna, candlelight cast kaleidoscopic patterns on stained glass. The new Holy Roman Emperor stood in the council chamber's center, unfurling a silk cloth. The dark red stains upon it were said to be the blood of Swedish royalty splattered during the trial. His voice was not loud, but carried undeniable weight: 'These Romani heretics dared lay hands on royal authority. Now, the order of Europe lies like a wheat field ravaged by a storm, in disarray. In the name of Frederick Barbarossa, we must launch 'Operation Redbeard,' so the waters of the Danube may again reflect the true face of Germany.'\n\nThe princes' responses rippled outward. The Duke of Bavaria set down his silver goblet, tapping the oak tabletop. 'I shall send five thousand heavy cavalry as vanguard. The crests on their armor will make those wanderers see what a real army looks like.' The Elector of Saxony stroked his beard and smiled, promising access to his silver mines. 'Worry not about war funds. If it drives their wagons from our lands, any amount of silver is worth it.' Even the observing Austrian nobles took ancestral battle-axes from their racks, the blades gleaming cold in the candlelight—they had long harbored resentment towards Domria's expansion in the north and feared Alfie's words, 'Romani blood runs as hot as noble blood,' might stir their own serfs.\n\nAs church bells echoed over the city, an elderly bishop stood on stone steps in a square, addressing the gathered crowd. His crucifix was gilded by sunlight; his voice carried far through the morning mist: 'This is not about seizing land, but helping to set the crooked world straight.' He paused, his gaze sweeping over the curious Romani vendors at the street corners. 'Wanderers remain wanderers. They cannot learn order, nor do they deserve it.'\n\nIn the markets, blacksmiths forged spears through the night, the clang of anvils mingling with the scent of wheat from bakeries. Noblewomen opened jewel boxes, donating gems to be melted for sword hilts, saying it was 'to preserve the rules our ancestors passed down.' Even children ran through the streets with wooden swords, imitating soldiers, shouting 'Drive out the wagons!'\n\nThe Danube flowed placidly; reeds on its banks swayed gently in the wind. No one noticed a few dew-laden reed leaves drifting downstream towards Domria, like silent letters foretelling the coming storm."

The street fighting didn't last long. As Domrian soldiers raised ladders against the walls of the Hofburg Palace, maids inside were slipping out side doors clutching the Emperor's silverware, while the very Emperor who had roared 'Let the Danube run red!' in a council meeting three days prior had already fled out the north gate with his mistress and two chests of gold coins.

EDG_DMR_play.33.d:0 "The Holy Roman Empire's declaration of war against Domria was initially viewed in the court as 'a simple act of chastisement.' The new Emperor would often fondle the silk supposedly stained with Swedish royal blood during councils, as if the dark red on his fingertips could transform into proof of military authority. He firmly believed Domria was merely 'a rabble gathered by wanderers,' and that the Imperial princes would charge for 'the glory of Germany' as they had for Frederick Barbarossa centuries ago.\n\nYet the princes' pledges hid their own calculations. The Duke of Bavaria readily offered five thousand heavy cavalry hoping the war would weaken Domria's trade routes along the Rhine, allowing his own beer to reach more city-states. The Elector of Saxony promised access to his silver mines, having calculated that a prolonged war would secure him more mining privileges from the Emperor. Even the observing Austrian nobles, their motivation for sharpening battle-axes, was not 'defending the righteous way' but fear that Domria's 'Romani blood runs as hot as noble blood' might reach their own serfs' ears—they preferred shedding blood on the battlefield to seeing sparks of rebellion ignite in their fields.\n\nHowever, all this dissipated with the defeat. With the Emperor's capital fallen and major electors capitulating under Domrian military pressure, this farce called 'Operation Redbeard' finally scattered to the winds. Regardless of how affairs changed, the Danube's waters still flowed eastward, only this time its banks were littered with uncleared armor fragments and broken spears. When Domrian soldiers washed their wounds by the river, they saw remnants of Imperial banners floating in the water, red silk bleached pale by the current, like faded flowers."

Sweden's land shall become the firm foundation beneath Romani wheels. I believe any force attempting to block us shall meet the same end!'\n\nWhat followed was the trial of the Swedish royal family. The atmosphere was solemn. The Swedish King and several royal members, bound in chains at the defendants' bench, faced charges including 'inciting hatred against the Romani' and 'deliberately sabotaging trade routes.' The King glared defiantly and raged: 'You stray dogs! You have no right to judge a sovereign monarch! Europe will not recognize your atrocities! Release me now, at once, and I may yet spare your lives!' Witnessing such defiance, Alfie grew furious. He immediately ordered the confiscation of all Swedish royal lands and property, to be awarded to Domrian generals who had distinguished themselves in the war. 'This is not plunder, but repayment for justice—what you stole from the Romani's dignity, you shall repay with land.' Alfie stared at the Swedish King, enunciating each word.

The monks of Salamanca were right—this isn't war, it's an assault on our very souls.' He understood deeply that neither Sunni Imams nor Catholic Cardinals would ever condone such sacrilege.\n\nYet in unseen places, a different scene unfolded. With Iberia's conflicts ended, peace had arrived, but famine and other disasters followed in swift succession, worsening the plight of an already impoverished land. The upper nobility might have watched this complacently, but Domria shattered that possibility. While peasants were slow to think such matters through, upon hearing news from the north of serfdom's abolition, they secretly sharpened their farming tools, ready to seize land from the landlords when the time came.\n\nOutside Toledo, an unknown peasant muttered to himself: 'I don't know what these Romani are like.

Last month's pricing still filled the guild's coffers, but this month half the weavers had secretly sold their cloth to grey-robed Romani merchants—those who brought madder dye, thirty percent cheaper than the guild's monopolized Persian indigo, their red cloth selling out instantly in the market.\n\nAnd he suddenly remembered the Papal call for Italian unity issued from Rome days prior. Though Italy had chosen to band together in collective defense against Domria's aggressive advance, this grand mobilization proved more thunder than rain. When real profit and material goods became tangible weapons against them, no one could resist this sugar-coated assault. He sighed, finally standing to look out the window.

Behind him stretched an army extending to the horizon. Soldiers' armor bore varied bloodstains: some with severed arms, tying bandages with their teeth; others prostrate on the ground, faces buried in heaps of fallen comrades, shoulders shaking with sobs. In the distant fields, plowshares had been blasted into scrap iron by cannon fire; church bell towers lay half-collapsed, revealing charred frames like broken wings.\n\nNow, the war was over.

He had his soldiers pitch tents along the Seine and sat by the riverbank himself, stirring wooden fragments in the water with his broken sword. Moonlight spread over the water like thin silver, illuminating his young, scar-laden face. He remembered the fallen: the young drummer who first followed his charge, just fifteen, struck by a stray bullet during the counterattack against Michy, still beating the 'advance' rhythm as he died; the female physician who took an arrow for him in an Italian city-state, her medicine chest always stocked with candy for children.\n\nAt this thought, Alfie sighed, then murmured: 'Which is more fortunate, the living or the dead?' In this unprecedented war, the dead had perished but would never face harsh reality again, while the living, though seeing what the dead could not, were filled with pain. Suddenly a figure appeared—Alfie's adjutant, Karlo. He smiled, showing white teeth. 'What troubles you, Your Majesty? A ruler should not be so tender-hearted.' 'Hmm,' Alfie meant to say something, but the thought of the early march tomorrow severed his reflections on life and death. 'At least we are still alive, Your Majesty.

Since the twin-headed eagle of Vienna fell, no region could claim to be more affected than the Lowlands.\n\nThe Dutch Kingdom's Finance Minister paced anxiously in the palace. The fireplace burned on its own, occasionally emitting a charred smell. Yet the minister felt no joy from this warmth, clutching intelligence from Cologne days earlier about Alfie dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. The report was crumpled in his hand, the words 'Vienna Falls' creased into folds.\n\n'That fellow Alfie, with a single decree, turned all Imperial toll stations into scrap paper!' he suddenly raged, hurling the crumpled paper to the floor. 'His Majesty in The Hague still argues with Parliament, saying we must wait for the Holy Roman Empire's "rightful successor" before setting tax rules,' but then the minister's voice dropped, as if afraid of being overheard. 'But the people below won't wait. Those Romani came without swords or spears, just words like "no more dues," and stirred hearts like this... It's more unnerving than when the Lotharingian army came.'\n\nOutside, wind swept dry leaves across the square. The minister gazed at the distant coastline, lost in thought, then sighed, slowly releasing his grip on the window frame, white marks still showing on his knuckles."

EDG_DMR_play.49.t:0 "The First Shovel of Earth"
EDG_DMR_play.49.d:0 "The Neva River had just thawed, broken arrow shafts from last year still sticking from the silt. Yanorò walked onto the riverbank over creaking frozen earth, mud from his boots plopping onto Peter Razi's ledger.\n'Swedes build sturdy walls,' Peter tapped the ruined fort wall with an iron ruler, 'but the foundation's too shallow—it leans with the north wind.'\nYanorò didn't reply, bending to pull a half-rotten wooden wheel from the mud. A frozen mussel was stuck between the spokes, its shell bearing a white axe mark. Several Romani craftsmen were dismantling the wreckage of Swedish warships; oak planks softened by fire were bent into arched beams for new gates.\n'Use the statue stone for baking ovens,' Yanorò tossed the mussel to playing children. 'The garrison ate hardtack for three months; their gums are bleeding.' Wind lifted the ledger's pages; Peter hastily pressed down the number-filled sheets: 'We're short four hundred cubic meters of stone, lime...'\n'Dismantle the ruined bell tower to the south,' Yanorò interrupted. 'The bell's copper is perfect for new chisels for the craftsmen.'\nThe afternoon sun melted the ice; the scent of pine drifted across the river. The craftsmen had repurposed Swedish tar barrels into glue pots, pine resin and fish glue bubbling together. Dipping a finger into the glue to mend the ledger's loose stitching, Peter suddenly laughed. 'This sticks better than church holy ointment.'\n\nRenaming the city was broached at dusk. Yanorò watched soldiers throw the 'Neva' street sign into the furnace, blue sparks flying as flames consumed the letters. Peter wrote beside a newly drawn map, ink blown by the wind smearing the words 'Grad.'\n'Rosgrad?' Yanorò read the name on the map.\n'Russians make up seventy percent of the labor teams,' Peter smoothed the map. 'Besides, the old name is a bit awkward, not very pleasant.' He smiled as he spoke.\nNearby, children ran over, drawing crooked wagon patterns with charcoal in the map's still-wet corners. Yanorò used his dagger tip to connect 'Ros' and 'Grad' in a single stroke, the cut deep as a wheel rut.\nAs night fell, the first section of the new wall rose. Peter buried a Swedish silver coin in the foundation; Yanorò pressed down a piece of Russian rye bread bearing a wheel print. Across the river came clanging sounds—craftsmen forging warship nails into plowshares, the firelight flickering in the night like scattered stars fallen to earth.\n\nBut at some unknown moment, Yanorò looked at the city under the night sky and suddenly picked up another plank. Noticing this, Peter approached and asked: 'What are you doing with that?' 'People usually call you Mr. Razi, but I also call you Peter.' '... So, you mean you're still thinking of a name? I'll listen to your opinion. What do you want to call it?' Yanorò rested his chin in his hand and said slowly:"

EDG_DMR_play.50.t:0 "On the Hill"
EDG_DMR_play.50.d:0 "The drifting ice of the Volga River thudded against the broken dock pilings. Yanorò walked up the hill stepping over an old Tatar crossbow, his leather boots sinking into the black soil smelling of horse dung.\n'The Golden Horde's cannons were buried crookedly,' Peter Razi poked a charred cannon barrel with an iron ruler. Yanorò didn't answer, bending to pull a half-burned wolf-head banner from the ashes. Faded agate beads were tangled in its corner, brittle from fire. Several Romani craftsmen were dismantling the copper wheels of Tatar carts; molten copper dripped into sand molds, cast into new church bell clappers.\n'Use the astrological stones to weigh down the pickling jars,' Yanorò tossed the agate beads to children playing with sheep bones. 'Our army's pickles are nearly gone; the men's mouths are covered in sores.'\nThe afternoon sun softened the frozen earth; the smell of boiling fish glue wafted from the riverbank. The craftsmen had repurposed Tatar leather shields into glue pots, fish bladders and birch sap boiling together. Dipping a finger into the glue to secure a loose corner of his ledger, Peter suddenly laughed. 'This sticks better than the Khan's seal oil.'\n\nThe naming was settled at sunset. Yanorò watched soldiers throw the 'Ukeyk' wooden sign into the bonfire, the flames releasing the scent of pine resin as they consumed the Turkic script. Peter wrote beside a newly carved boundary stone, the chisel marks casting long shadows in the evening sun.\n'Volgograd will do,' Yanorò read the name on the stone.\n'It's near the Volga River, so that's fine,' Peter brushed dust from the carved letters.\nAs night fell, clanging sounds came from downriver—craftsmen forging broken arrowheads into horse bits, the hammering startling resting migratory birds, their wings flapping over the river's drifting ice. Peter stood alone on the city wall—Yanorò had long gone to be a chief overseer—and murmured to himself:"

EDG_DMR_play.51.d:0 "Yet the decisive battle did not bring the expected storm of bloodshed. When Yanorò's forces surged like a tide towards the gates of the royal city, the defending soldiers offered only symbolic resistance before laying down their arms—they had long grown weary of the Prince's rule. The sound of chariots rumbling over the streets awoke the sleeping city but did not cause great panic. Residents pushed open their windows, watching these people dressed in different attire cross the square and head towards the palace.\n\nInside the palace, the Prince and his close associates had long since vanished, leaving behind only empty halls and scattered documents. Yanorò entered, glanced around briefly, and then ordered his men to bring the stockpiled grain out to the streets to distribute to the people who had gathered upon hearing the news.\n\n'From today, there will be no Prince of Turov,' Yanorò said to the crowd that had gathered, his voice not loud but clear to every ear. 'We will rebuild the houses together, cultivate the wasteland, and make life better, little by little.'\n\nThere were no cheers from the crowd, only a few hushed discussions, and soon people picked up tools and followed the Roma to repair the city walls, slightly damaged by the war. Sunlight gradually dispersed the thin mist, shining upon the different figures."

EDG_DMR_play.54.t:0 "Beneath the Two Holy Cities"
EDG_DMR_play.54.d:0 "The morning mist had not yet dissipated; the marble of the Kaaba glowed softly in the faint light. Andre dismounted, his cloak still dusted with desert sand. The dagger passed down through three generations hung at his waist in its sheath, the double-barred cross on its hilt flickering in the dawn light. He raised a hand to stop the soldiers who moved to clear the area, his fingertips lightly brushing the black kiswa draped over the Kaaba—the Qur'anic verses embroidered upon it trembled slightly in the wind.\n\n'Distribute the water skins,' Andre's voice was not loud, yet it pierced through the murmurs of the morning prayer. 'Let the pilgrims continue their rites. No one is to disturb them.' His adjutant Ivan hesitated for a moment beside him, then waved for the guards to bring forward wooden crates filled with dates and fresh water. Not far away, several Bedouin shepherds in white headdresses clutched their prayer beads nervously. Seeing the soldiers not only refrain from violence but also offer water, the wariness in their eyes gradually turned to bewilderment. Andre paced slowly along the base of the Kaaba. He suddenly recalled a story his grandfather told him in childhood: how their ancestors led camels across the desert, wishing only to make a vow before the Kaaba to 'find a place to call home,' yet were turned away for their 'pagan' faith.\n\n'My orders,' Andre turned to face the gathered officers. 'Begin repairing the wells of Mecca immediately. Distribute the grain brought from Egypt to the surrounding villages. Also, send men to Medina. Replace the damaged scripture shelves in the Prophet's Mosque with new ones, and invite local scholars to organize the scattered manuscript copies of the scriptures.'\n'Your Majesty,' Ivan couldn't help but interject, 'we have just captured these two Holy Cities. Not setting up defenses is one thing, but expending resources to help them with repairs?'\nAndre bent down, picked up a date pit blown by the wind, and gently pressed it into the sandy soil beside the Kaaba. 'You think we came to conquer?' He pointed towards the pilgrims receiving water in the distance. 'Their ancestors refused our forefathers, but today, we cannot respond with the same narrow-mindedness. A true Holy City should not be reserved for only one faith.'\n\nThree days later, before the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, Andre personally unveiled the newly cast scripture shelves. Under the sunlight, a local Imam, holding a restored manuscript copy of the Qur'an, hesitantly offered it to him. Andre did not accept it but gave a slight bow. 'This is your faith. It is rightfully yours to safeguard.' He paused, his gaze sweeping over the devout believers within the mosque. 'But remember, whether circling the Kaaba or praying to the stars, the direction of a good heart has always been one and the same.'\n\nThat evening, Andre lit a bonfire in the courtyard of the Prophet's Mosque, inviting Bedouin chieftains, scholars from Mecca, and Roma craftsmen to sit around it. As the flames danced, someone strummed a lute, another sang an ancient song of migration, and melodies in different languages gradually intertwined. Watching this scene, Andre drew from his chest half of a bronze chariot wheel—a token left by Yanorò when he captured Constantinople long ago. He gently placed it beside the bonfire. 'From this day on, Mecca and Medina are no longer battlegrounds, but places where all may find rest.'\n\nAs the night deepened, the Black Stone of the Kaaba shone quietly under the moonlight. In the distance, the sound of flowing water from a well could be heard—newly repaired channels were sending fresh water to every household. Andre knew that conquering two cities was easy, but winning hearts was hard. And so, he suddenly understood what his granduncle Yanorò meant by 'a place to call home'—it was never seized by the sword, but built through inclusion. Yet inclusion requires skill, and even more, a balanced heart. As the bonfire was about to die out, Andre looked up at the starry sky. An idea suddenly came to him:"

EDG_DMR_play.55.t:0 "The Ark's Response"
EDG_DMR_play.55.d:0 "Morning light pierced through the gunpowder smoke, revealing the mottled cracks on the cathedral's dome under the sun. Andre slowly ascended the stone steps, his boot heels crushing fragments of rubble mixed with strands of golden thread—remnants of the Ethiopian royal flag. When his guards pushed open the heavy oak doors of the cathedral, he suddenly raised his hand to halt the procession, his gaze falling on the entrance to the chamber behind the altar: the cross patterns carved on the door intertwined with the Domrian double-barred cross, appearing almost seamless in the morning mist.\n\nInside the chamber, the Ark of the Covenant, veiled in purple velvet, stood quietly on a stone pedestal. The copper corners had acquired a green patina with age, and tiny flecks of gold were still embedded within the carved palm leaf patterns on its surface. Andre approached, his fingertips lightly brushing the edge of the velvet—the texture of the fabric reminded him of the cloak his mother had woven in her lifetime, similarly soft yet carrying the weight of years. He did not immediately unveil the Ark but turned to the Ethiopian Archbishop behind him and said, 'You do it.'\n\nThe old Archbishop approached trembling, his withered fingers pausing on the velvet for a long moment before slowly drawing it back. The copper surface of the Ark reflected a cold light, and the gemstones inlaid on its door, though dulled, still hinted at their former brilliance.\n\n'Your Majesty, this is a Christian relic, according to canon law...' the Archbishop's voice was tense, but Andre gently interrupted him. He drew from his chest a piece of parchment, yellowed at the edges, bearing a prayer written long ago by his granduncle Yanorò: 'My ancestors once made a vow before the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, that all faiths should find a place of belonging. Today, I have come to fulfill that promise.'\n\nAndre signaled for his guards to bring forth a newly cast copper lock, its body engraved simultaneously with the double-barred cross and an Ethiopian Orthodox icon. 'The Ark shall remain in St. George's Cathedral,' he said, handing the lock to the Archbishop, 'but this lock has two keys—one in your hand, safeguarding the faith of the believers; the other in the Domrian treasury, witnessing our pledge.'\n\nThe Archbishop took the key, his knuckles white with emotion. Andre then looked at the gathered soldiers and people, his voice clear and firm: 'I know some among you fear, afraid that the so-called infidel's iron heel will crush your holy relics. But today, I tell you, I have come here solely so that you need no longer feel tense because of so-called differences.'\n\nHe bent down and stroked the copper surface of the Ark, a chill transmitting through his fingertips: 'When Moses led the Ark out of Egypt, it was to seek the Promised Land; today we have come here so that every place may become a Promised Land.'\n\nWhen Andre stepped out of the cathedral, sunlight already bathed the square. The sound of craftsmen hammering stone came from afar, while nearby, children holding newly distributed wheat seeds ran about. Ethiopian people and Roma soldiers stood side by side in the square, looking towards the chamber housing the Ark—where hostile confrontation no longer existed, only the quiet interweaving of different faiths' radiance in the morning light. Andre tightened his grip on the dagger at his waist, the double-barred cross on its hilt and the copper gleam of the Ark reflecting each other, shimmering with a faint sunlight."
