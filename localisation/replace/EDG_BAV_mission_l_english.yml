Regensburg, relying on its status as an Imperial City, has repeatedly used its privileges as a shield. However, to unite the territories of Bavaria seamlessly and ensure that taxes and military service are no longer divided by city walls, this riverside city must understand: freedom is not an excuse for lawlessness but a grace granted within order.

The princes whisper in the diets and courts: today's boundaries of Bavarian expansion may tomorrow become their own lands and privileges.
