EDG_TUR_nation_title:0 "@TUR Rebuild the Ottoman Empire"
EDG_TUR_nation_desc:0 "The Turks are a Turkic people, originally a small Turkic tribe under the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. This tribe gradually settled on the Anatolian peninsula in Turkey, initially engaging in frequent integration and warfare with the Byzantine-Greek peoples. Through maneuvering and conflict among the Byzantine Empire and other Anatolian Turkic peoples, the Turks gradually flourished, giving rise to the modern Turkish nation. After the collapse of the Sultanate of Rum in 1308, Anatolia between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean fragmented into multiple independent states, collectively known as the Anatolian Beyliks. In 1299, the Turks took advantage of the division of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum to formally declare independence, adopting the title 'Ghazi' and laying the foundation for the Turkish state. In 1402, at the Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Timur's forces, and Sultan Bayezid was captured. This led to a war of succession among Bayezid's four sons, and due to various interferences, the empire remained fragmented. However, all this will soon come to an end."

EDG_make_kie_capital_title:0 "Make Kiev the Capital"
EDG_make_kie_capital_desc:0 "Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, is hailed as the 'Mother of Rus' Cities.' It is the oldest city founded by the East Slavs, located on a terrace approximately 90 meters high on the right bank of the Dnieper River, surrounded by steep cliffs on three sides, making it a formidable stronghold. The earliest East Slavic chronicle, The Primary Chronicle (compiled in the 12th century), records the origin of 'Kiev City': The Polyanian tribal chieftain brothers—Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv—jointly 'built a fortress, naming it Kiev after the eldest brother.' This occurred around the turn of the 6th to 7th centuries, forming the core of the later city of Kiev. Kiev has been the political center of Ruthenia. Now that Kiev is under our possession, we can establish it as our new capital."
EDG_ruthenian_provincial_system_title:0 "Perfect the Ruthenian Feudal System"
EDG_ruthenian_provincial_system_desc:0 "The rulers of the Ruthenian region have long adhered to the ancient feudal system, an old order constructed by suzerains and powerful vassals, which ultimately led to the outbreak of civil war in Kievan Rus'. After the civil war, no one wishes to repeat the fate of the Grand Prince of Kiev. Therefore, we must prevent the emergence of powerful magnates within our realm."
EDG_yard_landlord_system_title:0 "Expand the Odnodvortsy Community"
EDG_yard_landlord_system_desc:0 "Russian landowners and lords are required to provide troops for the state. However, providing soldiers means a reduction in the serfs owned by the landowners, so they typically only supply vagrants and ruffians as soldiers, whose combat effectiveness is very low. The Odnodvortsy are a special class in the Rus' region, essentially acting as the fief agents of the noble landowners. They handle the daily management affairs for their superiors, which is their economic role. Militarily, Odnodvortsy who join the army possess higher quality and are highly effective soldiers. We can rely on them to form the core strength of our military."

EDG_ruthenian_adm_tech_6_Economic_reform_desc:0 "In 1470, a Ruthenian man named Vladimir Ivanovich Ivanov traveled throughout Kievan Rus'. He was knowledgeable yet held peculiar views, proposing a concept for economic reform, a key component of which was the establishment of workshops. It is said that in his early years, he posted recruitment notices for workshops in Kiev's main square, declaring that working in a workshop was a promising future. He also petitioned local municipal officials to grant certain privileges to local artisans. This man seemed to be speaking nonsense, but our ruler is quite intrigued by his ideas."

EDG_ruthenian_mil_tech_9_reform_title:0 "Expand the Odnodvortsy Officer Corps"
EDG_ruthenian_mil_tech_9_reform_desc:0 "On the battlefield, training and combat experience have always held significant value. With the advent of gunpowder and tactical changes due to other infantry weapons, there is a great demand for troops proficient in using new weaponry. When professional armies cannot meet this demand, it can only be addressed by recruiting mercenaries from places like Italy, Switzerland, or Germany. An increasing number of professional mercenary officers have provided substantial personnel support to nations undergoing military transformation. The same is true for the Rus' region, which faces prolonged war threats. The demand for professional officers has always been urgent. Prioritizing the training and recruitment of professional officers on the national agenda can greatly enhance the army's combat effectiveness."

Without this process, they could not later launch large-scale expeditions and colonial activities, nor could they build a vast empire. The formation of a nation-state is not only a process of expelling foreign enemies but also one of resolving internal ethnic conflicts and achieving relative centralization and unity among various domestic political forces. Accomplishing this often requires intense ideological conflict and bloody struggle.

Simultaneously, the Divan served as the supreme administrative organ and acted as the high command during wartime. By the reign of Mehmed II, Sultans began to personally preside over council meetings, which were typically held near the gate of the Sultan's palace.

Roman Emperor Constantine the Great rebuilt and expanded Byzantium at the edge of Europe, declaring the relocation of the capital to this strategically positioned city in 330 AD, renaming it Nova Roma, also known as Constantinople, meaning 'City of Constantine.' From then on, the city began its glorious millennium-long history, with Constantine's name forever intertwined with it. On January 17, 395 AD, after the death of Roman Emperor Theodosius I, the Roman Empire officially split into the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. Constantinople, as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, became the political, economic, cultural, and religious center of the eastern Mediterranean. The Byzantines further fortified the city with the Theodosian Walls, making the entire urban area a naturally formidable fortress, easy to defend and difficult to attack.

They established a settlement on the banks of the River Thames, naming it 'Londinium.' Subsequently, the Romans built walls around it and gradually developed a sizable city within the enclosed area. Although 'Londinium' appears to be a Latin name, some scholars believe it originates from the language of the Celts who originally inhabited the area, possibly meaning a wild place or a place where the river flows. Londinium was once a barren land settled by Celts long ago, but it has now transformed into a prosperous city.

This translation adopted a 'vulgar' Latin style, distinct from Cicero's oratorical and elegant classical form, hence 'Vulgate,' meaning 'common' or 'vulgar.'\n\nAfter the Reformation, to counter the influence of Protestantism, the Council of Trent in 1546 designated the Vulgate as the authoritative version of the Bible. The council also commissioned the Pope to produce a standard text. With funding from Pope Sixtus V, the first standard text was printed. Unfortunately, this edition contained numerous printing errors. Subsequent Pope Clement VIII ordered corrections and further revisions, resulting in the Clementine Vulgate, also known as the Vulgate of Clement VIII. Until the publication of the New Vulgate in 1979, the Clementine edition of 1592 remained the standard Bible version of the Roman Catholic Church."

Crown Prince Hugues was appointed amid crisis but found himself under attack from all directions, struggling to defend the realm. When Lotharingian King Louis VII arrived at Reims, an unexpected event occurred: a peasant girl named Jeanne d'Arc from Orléans led soldiers loyal to the Crown Prince to shut the gates of Reims, resisting the Lotharingian assault. This caused the Lotharingian King to miss the optimal time for coronation at Reims and forced him to return to his lands to suppress rebellions by German lords. In the subsequent war, Crown Prince Hugues successfully crowned himself King of France at Reims in 1432, taking the regnal name Hugues VII, with Jeanne d'Arc by his side, repelling attacks from Lotharingians, English, and Arletians until 1444. In retaliation, the English bribed the Papacy to have Jeanne d'Arc condemned as a heretic—a disgrace for France. We must demand the Papacy retry the case of Joan of Arc."

However, in 843, his three sons decided to partition the Frankish Empire into three parts through the Treaty of Verdun. The empire was further subdivided multiple times by the Treaty of Prüm in 855, the Treaty of Meerssen in 870, and the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Thereafter, the Frankish Empire was never reunited. The different parts of the empire developed distinct customs, cultures, and languages, evolving into independent states. For a time, the divided realms were still referred to as East Francia, Middle Francia, and West Francia, but these designations faded away about a century later as the Carolingian dynasty declined. Only the western region of 'France' continued to use the Frankish name, while East Francia evolved into the Holy Roman Empire, maintaining the tradition of the Roman Emperor."

If Lefèvre was largely a theologian and translator, then Budé was a more genuine classical scholar. He was not only proficient in Greek but also widely versed in philosophy, theology, law, and medicine. Leveraging his exceptional closeness to the royal family, he advised King Francis I to establish the Royal College dedicated to the study of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. Upon its establishment, the college not only became the center of advanced academic research in France, reviving interest in classical languages, but also served as a crucial stronghold to counter the conservative forces represented by the University of Paris, which was controlled by the Catholic Church."

EDG_FRA_decision_6_title:0 "@FRA£adm£ Issue the Edict of Fontainebleau"
EDG_FRA_decision_6_desc:0 "Louis XIV believed that to attain supreme power, religious unity in France was essential—meaning the prohibition of religious freedom. Thus, he exerted pressure on Protestant believers, especially the Huguenots prevalent in France, most notably through the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. Encouraged by fervent Catholics such as the Marquis de Louvois, the Minister of War, and Archbishop Bossuet, he revoked Henry IV's Edict of Nantes from 1598, which had granted tolerance to Protestants. After the edict was issued, Reformed churches were destroyed, Protestant schools were closed, and most Reformed believers were forced to convert to Catholicism. Louis XIV's order compelled over two hundred thousand unwilling Reformed adherents to emigrate, relocating to the Netherlands, Prussia, England, Northern Europe, and North America. Many historians consider this a fatal error, as many of these refugees were skilled artisans, resulting in the exodus of Reformed craftsmanship abroad. These immigrants brought immense wealth to the countries they reached. However, for Louis XIV and France's devout archbishops, a unified France should be a Catholic France; indeed, the policy of forced conversion of Reformed adherents gained fervent support from the majority of French Catholics. Most French people believed that combating the "heretical" Reformed faith was a divine mandate."
