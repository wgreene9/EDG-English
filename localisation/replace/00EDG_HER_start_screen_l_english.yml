Perhaps he will achieve the greatest conquest of England and bestow the title of Goddess Britannia upon his future empire. To the south, §YEdward III§! of the House of Plantagenet is far more capable than his mediocre father, and though his position is difficult, he remains formidable. War in Britain is imminent. Will Mercia's autonomous cities manage to survive?"
