EDG_BELA_SMI_1_2_title:0 "Establish Our Faith"
EDG_BELA_SMI_1_2_desc:0 "Christianity was brought by the Swedes, Norwegians, and Rus, who spared no effort in spreading this religion to us. Despite some differences in details, both the Christianity of the Swedes and that of the Rus are more helpful in aiding us to establish a unified state organization than our original shamanistic religion."

EDG_BELA_SMI_2_3_title:0 "Bridge the East and West"
EDG_BELA_SMI_2_3_desc:0 "Due to different rulers, our kinsmen in the east and west are growing further apart. We must bridge this division as soon as possible."

EDG_BELA_SMI_3_1_title:0 "Influence from the Outside" # Influences from the Outside World
EDG_BELA_SMI_3_1_desc:0 "With the northward expansion of the Norwegians, Swedes, and Rus, our old Sámi order has been disrupted by these outsiders. After their repeated incursions, we are left with only our last remaining living space. However, by learning the various forms of knowledge brought by these 'civilized people,' we too can establish our own state to protect our existence."

EDG_BELA_SMI_3_2_title:0 "Organize Our Military"
EDG_BELA_SMI_3_2_desc:0 "When we still lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers on this land, we neither needed nor had the capacity to establish an armed force—a military. But if we wish to engage in diplomacy with the 'civilized societies' to the south, a military is indispensable."

EDG_BELA_SMI_3_3_title:0 "Choose Our Future"
EDG_BELA_SMI_3_3_desc:0 "After we Sámi have truly established our own state, we possess for the first time the power to choose our own destiny—though this choice is not entirely free..."

EDG_BELA_SMI_3_4_title:0 "From Afar"
EDG_BELA_SMI_3_4_desc:0 "Lapland—this is what the southern Suomi call us, and it represents how all southern civilizations view us. Perhaps we should establish our nation under this name."

EDG_BELA_SMI_4_3_title:0 "Connect North and South"
EDG_BELA_SMI_4_3_desc:0 "The south and the north are separated by the boundary between hunter-gatherer peoples and agricultural peoples. Although closely related by kinship, customs differ. We should strive to downplay differences and emphasize our connections."

EDG_BELA_SMI_5_2_title:0 "Reflect on Our Past"
EDG_BELA_SMI_5_2_desc:0 "The social organizational experience from the tribal era might be useful to us, but can these experiences truly be applied to the future? I'm afraid we must still be prepared to transform our society!"
