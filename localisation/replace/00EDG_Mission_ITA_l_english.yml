EDG_MISSION_ITA_3_28_title:0 "Workshop Production"
EDG_MISSION_ITA_3_28_desc:0 "A series of technological innovations in the 16th and 17th centuries increased the output of resources such as iron and cloth. However, the greatest innovation in production lay in various new organizational methods. Commercial capitalists established factories outside the cities, circumventing the guild regulations that restricted large-scale production, while also exploring new methods to enhance production efficiency, such as the organization and specialization of labor. These pioneers of the future Industrial Revolution did not rely on expensive new machinery to boost industrial output; instead, they achieved their goals by discovering convenient ways to obtain raw materials and organizing large-scale production activities. Compared to the old, restrictive ancien régime, this was undoubtedly a tremendous innovation. Accompanied by subsequent technological revolutions, this new model would bring profound changes to society."

EDG_MISSION_ITA_3_30_title:0 "Modern State"
EDG_MISSION_ITA_3_30_desc:0 "In the previous century, Rationalism and Empiricism gained increasing favor among great thinkers. Whether monarchs, scientists, or men of letters—in letters, books, or coffeehouses—discussions centered on how open-mindedness, the scientific method, and the spread of Enlightenment ideas could bring a better future for all humanity. From renowned universities to the courts of enlightened monarchs, people everywhere were scientifically measuring, quantifying, classifying, and mapping the world to better understand the laws by which it operates. Simultaneously, many also explored the laws governing society, attempting to discern the true meaning of so-called 'human rights.' For the welfare of all humankind, grand projects were undertaken, such as compiling encyclopedias encompassing all knowledge or completing illustrated catalogs of all the world's plants, animals, and fungi. The light of Reason was slowly rising, and for many, their mission was to tirelessly ensure this light illuminated every corner of the Earth."

EDG_MISSION_ITA_4_28_title:0 "Improving Production Methods"
