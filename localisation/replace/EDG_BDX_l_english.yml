EDG_BDX_events.0.d:0 "When Badakhshan is mentioned, most people's reaction is likely, 'Where is that?'. Those who do know the name usually learned of it from two sources: rubies and music. Badakhshan produces a type of ruby called 'Balas', meaning 'Crimson Dawn', renowned for its dazzling bright red hue. The most famous of these is undoubtedly the 'Black Prince's Ruby'. This gem was given by Pedro I of Castile to Edward, the Black Prince of England, in 1367 and has since been set at the very center of the English State Crown. The music of Badakhshan is also distinctive, characterized by the use of many chromatic tones and minor scales within a narrow melodic range, primarily played on the lute, especially the wooden-plectrum, three-stringed, short-necked 'Pamiri rubab'. The singing features a unique, husky nasal tone, and the lyrics often carry Sufi mystical themes, melancholic in nature, dealing with divine love, separation, reunion, love, and suffering.\n\n'What is ordinary and taken for granted?' Mir [Root.Monarch.GetName] pondered this question while playing the rubab. Perhaps Badakhshan itself is an answer. Sheltered in a corner of the Hindu Kush mountains and hindered by difficult transportation, it has had little exchange with the outside world. Though now content in its seclusion in Badakhshan, according to genealogical records, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has an ancestor known to all—Alexander the Great. Moreover, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s family is likely the sole surviving lineage of Alexander the Great, having ruled here since the days of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Given its mountainous terrain, Badakhshan has never been a strategic priority for conquerors; both the Caliphs and Genghis Khan overlooked this land, allowing the Mir's family to maintain their rule to this day. Even Timur the Lame, who sought to swallow the whole world, disdained invading Badakhshan, merely demanding the Mir's submission.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] increasingly feels lost within the peaks of the Hindu Kush. When he was young and inexperienced, his father often told him tales of Alexander the Great's great conquests: from the League of Corinth, to the three major battles at Granicus, Issus, and Gaugamela, to the tears shed by the Hydaspes River. From that day, [Root.Monarch.GetName] began to dream. Perhaps one day, the Turks would be driven away, the Kingdom of Bactria would be restored, the glory of the Argead dynasty would be revived, and he would return to Babylon or even Pella, becoming a great conqueror like Alexander the Great, revered by all... However, under the yoke of Timur, all this seemed but a fanciful dream."

Ala al-Dawla, guarding Fergana, has reportedly struck a secret pact with the Uzbek Khan Abu'l-Khayr to the north, who stands ready to march south at any moment to install Ala al-Dawla. Ala al-Dawla's brother, Babur, watches coldly from Khwarezm, biding his time. As a local lord in distant Badakhshan, [Root.Monarch.GetName] should ideally stay out of Timurid family feuds, yet the situation has developed to a point where neutrality is no longer an option.\n\nUlugh Beg has sent an envoy with a chest of gold coins as a gift to Badakhshan, hoping the Mir will support his faction in the potential war of succession to come. If the glory of Alexander's empire is to be revived, the Timurid yoke must be cast off, and this chaos presents the perfect opportunity.

Escorted by the armies of [SHY.GetName], Ala al-Dawla has ascended the throne in Samarkand and been crowned the new Sultan. The courtiers and common people all look on askance, filled with anger but not daring to speak out. Under Ala al-Dawla's rule, our armies come and go in Samarkand freely and without hindrance. We know he dares not oppose us, for without the protection of the Uzbeks, his rule would not last a single day.\n\nAmidst this chaotic war of succession, we have taken advantage of the turmoil to seize several cities with the help of the Uzbeks. This marks our transformation from a petty hill-king content in his isolated corner into a force to be reckoned with in Transoxiana, taking the first step towards reviving our ancestors' glory. However, it is clear that Khan [SHY.Monarch.GetName] will not tolerate such opportunistic gains for long.

Ala al-Dawla, having already made a secret pact with the Uzbek Khan Abu'l-Khayr, upon learning of the events in Samarkand, has openly rebelled. Khan Abu'l-Khayr has also gathered a great army and invaded Transoxiana from the north to interfere in the Timurid succession crisis.

EDG_BDX_events.14.d:0 "Badakhshan, as the crossroads of the Asian continent, situated at the junction of Iran-Turan, the Indian subcontinent, and the East, has naturally fostered diverse cultural and religious communities.\n\nThe earliest Indo-Aryan ancestors of the Badakhshan people adhered to a primitive Vedic Brahmanism. From the 7th to 6th centuries BC, Zoroaster founded Zoroastrianism in the region of Afghanistan. Like elsewhere in Iran, Badakhshan gradually converted to Zoroastrianism. However, in remote mountainous areas, some inhabitants retained their primitive Brahmanic faith up to the present day. This region is known to us as Kafiristan, the 'Land of the Infidels'.\n\nThe eastern campaigns of Alexander the Great fundamentally altered the local situation. Badakhshan was incorporated into the territory of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and the Greeks brought Hellenistic polytheism to this distant frontier. Meanwhile, in India, after Ashoka of the Maurya Empire embraced Buddhism, he dedicated himself to spreading Buddhism westward. The Hellenized kingdoms of India and Bactria were thus profoundly influenced by Buddhism. For over a millennium thereafter, Buddhism remained the dominant faith in Badakhshan. Zoroastrianism experienced a revival during the conquests of the Sasanian Empire but failed to shake Buddhism's mainstream status.\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in Afghanistan began with the conquests of the Caliphate. Although Buddhists were granted 'dhimmi' status, Buddhism inevitably waned over time. The ancestors of Mir [Root.Monarch.GetName] also converted to Sunni Islam during this process. In the 11th century AD, the Isma'ili scholar Nasir Khusraw came to Badakhshan to preach, leading to the conversion of large numbers of Badakhshanis to Isma'ilism, forming a stable Isma'ili community. Nasir, one of the most eminent theologians of the Fatimid Caliphate, was born in Balkh and revered by his followers as 'Shah Sayyid Nasir'. His works, unusually composed in Persian rather than Arabic, include his famous travelogue, the Safarnama. Isma'ilism gradually became the mainstream in Badakhshan. During the Isma'ili schism caused by internal strife within the Fatimid Caliphate, Badakhshan became a stronghold of the Nizari branch. After the Nizari Ismaili state (the Order of Assassins) was destroyed by Hulagu Khan during the Mongol invasions, Badakhshan became the primary surviving Nizari community. Due to the influx of Buddhist refugees fleeing warfare into Badakhshan, Buddhists still retained a significant presence there.\n\nWith the westward migration of the Kerait and Naiman tribes, who adhered to Christianity (specifically the Nestorian Church, also known as the Church of the East), to escape the Mongols, and the conversion to Nestorianism by the Mongol-affiliated Kartid dynasty in Afghanistan, the influence of Nestorian Christianity grew in Badakhshan. The positions of Isma'ilism and Buddhism were challenged by this new faith.\n\nAlthough the ancestors of Mir [Root.Monarch.GetName] converted to Sunni Islam under the influence of the Muslim conquests, Sunni Islam never became the mainstream in Badakhshan. Despite having to display fervor for Sunni Islam due to subservience to the Timurid Empire, in the diverse and complex religious environment of Badakhshan, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never been an extremely devout Sunni Muslim. Perhaps we should reconsider and choose a faith more suited to ruling the region as our official state religion."

The sole reason Timur might have refrained from trampling Badakhshan with his iron hooves, turning it into mountains of corpses and seas of blood, was likely his reluctance to cross towering mountains to conquer a tiny land surrounded by peaks. The price for Timur's mercy was that the Mir of Badakhshan had to travel to Samarkand every few years, bearing the region's famous rubies as tribute, to pay homage to the Sultan and acknowledge his authority. Today is once again such a day for an audience with the Sultan.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been to Samarkand several times. Even so, he is once again awestruck by the grandeur of one of the contemporary Islamic world's great centers of science and arts. At the Registan Square, the elegant recitation of the Quran echoes from the Bibi-Khanym Mosque, rows of heavily armed cavalry parade by, and Islamic scholars from around the world debate philosophical issues. Unfortunately, the once lavishly funded Ulugh Beg Observatory seems to have fallen into disuse long ago. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] senses an anomaly from time to time. The atmosphere in Samarkand today feels different from before. The calm air subtly exudes a chilling sense of solemnity, making one break into a cold sweat involuntarily.\n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrives outside the palace where the Sultan resides, this sense of discord grows stronger. He receives no ceremonial welcome, and after stating his purpose to the court envoy, there is a long delay without a response. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands outside for an entire afternoon. As evening approaches, a man with a stern expression enters the palace. Just as [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares to make way, the man's guards roughly shove [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his servants to the ground. The tribute rubies in the servants' hands scatter everywhere. [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognizes this man: he is Abdalá Mirza, an immensely powerful local noble. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets up from the ground, he sees someone not far away who has been staring intently at the scene with a hawk-like gaze, though it's unclear whether the stare is directed at him or at Abdalá. He seems to have seen that person before... Abu Sa'id, perhaps. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is momentarily at a loss, quickly retreating to a corner to continue waiting. After a long while, a court envoy finally tells [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the Sultan does not wish to receive him; he is to leave the tribute and depart immediately."

After Alexander succeeded to the Macedonian throne and assumed leadership of the League of Corinth, he led his forces to quell rebellions in Thrace and Illyria. With no news from Alexander, rumors spread among the Greeks that he had perished in Illyria. Thebes, one of the three great Greek city-states, firmly believing the rumors of Macedonian weakness, launched a war to overthrow Macedonian hegemony.\n\nThe Greek city-states had only recently been subdued, and Macedonian control over the south was not yet fully consolidated. If Thebes rebelled, Athens would surely follow, and other Greek city-states would rise in response, creating an uncontrollable situation. Having just pacified Thrace, Alexander, upon hearing of the Theban revolt, immediately force-marched his army through the roadless mountains of western Macedonia, reaching Thessaly in just seven days and Boeotia in a mere thirteen days to rendezvous with his forces. The Thebans, hearing that Alexander had passed through Thermopylae, refused to believe it, convinced Alexander was dead. When they discovered Alexander truly had arrived in Boeotia, many Greek city-states immediately abandoned their quest for independence, leaving Thebes to fight alone.\n\nAlexander, wishing to avoid large-scale conflict, advanced slowly on Thebes to apply pressure, waiting for the Thebans to recognize reality. He also offered generous terms: only the two chief instigators of the rebellion need be handed over, and no others would be punished. However, the Thebans remained uncompromising, and negotiations broke down. Still hoping for a change of heart, Alexander did not press the assault. But the Thebans resolved to fight to the last man, displaying astonishing ferocity, and for a time the battle turned against Alexander. Noticing that a side gate of Thebes was left undefended amidst the chaos, Alexander immediately ordered Perdiccas to lead the phalanx into the city. The exhausted Theban soldiers, learning that Macedonian troops had breached their walls, frantically retreated into the city. Cavalry trampled infantry, chaos ensued, and ultimately they were defeated.\n\nDue to the fierce Theban resistance, the battle degenerated into a sack. To punish the Thebans, Alexander ordered the city razed to the ground. Athens and other rebellious city-states hastily sued for peace, begging for forgiveness. Thereafter, no Greek city-state dared to challenge Macedonian authority again."

Fulfilling his father Philip II's ambition, after consolidating his rule over Greece, Alexander led a coalition of Macedonians and Greek city-states across the Hellespont to begin his campaign in Asia. The Persian satraps of Asia Minor gathered their forces and encamped outside the city of Zeleia. At the Persian military council in Zeleia, the Greek mercenary commander Memnon of Rhodes proposed a scorched earth policy to deprive Alexander of supplies and force his retreat. However, Arsites, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, and other commanders distrusted Memnon and rejected the proposal, deciding instead to give battle on the banks of the Granicus River in the Troad region of northwestern Asia Minor.\n\nAt the outset of the battle, Alexander dispatched the cavalry and infantry of his right wing to attack the Persian left, while the rest of his forces advanced in an oblique formation. The Persians, believing the Macedonian coalition intended a flanking maneuver, shifted troops from their center to reinforce the left. Seeing the Persian center weakened and its formation loosened by this movement, Alexander immediately ordered a full-scale assault across the entire line. He personally led his Companion Cavalry in a charge across the Granicus River. Alexander, conspicuous in his gleaming armor, came under fierce attack from Persian forces and was only saved by Cleitus the Black, who helped repel the Persian cavalry. Meanwhile, Parmenion, commanding the left wing, also routed the Persian right. The retreating Persian cavalry became entangled with their own infantry, many of their commanders had fallen in the fighting against Alexander's crossing, and the Persian line collapsed completely.\n\nThe Greek mercenaries in Persian service, maintaining strict discipline, retreated in good order to high ground. However, Alexander refused their offer of surrender. Enraged that Greeks had fought for Persia, he ordered a full assault. The mercenaries were either slaughtered or captured and enslaved. After the battle, most of the Persian satraps governing Asia Minor lay dead on the field, and Arsites, having escaped, committed suicide.\n\nThe Battle of the Granicus was the first of Alexander the Great's three decisive battles against the Persian Empire. It liberated the Greek cities on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea, establishing them as a forward base for the subsequent eastern campaigns."

Darius then advanced to Issus, cutting the Macedonian coalition's supply lines from the rear, forcing Alexander to turn back and face the Persian army. The battlefield was at the mouth of the Pinarus River, south of the village of Issus.\n\nAlexander, concerned that the numerically superior Persian force might outflank his left wing, secured that flank by advancing along the coast. The Persians, having arrived first, occupied advantageous positions, forcing the Macedonians to attack across steep riverbanks. Yet, the Persian numerical advantage did not bring victory. The poor quality of the Persian infantry proved decisive, allowing Alexander to break through the Persian left. Most critically, Darius III abandoned his armor and fled the battlefield towards the end of the fighting. His troops, their morale shattered, scrambled to retreat, but the narrow Persian camp made escape difficult. They were massacred by the pursuing Macedonians. Darius's wife and mother were both captured.\n\nIn the Battle of Issus, Alexander the Great defeated a Persian army twice the size of his own.

As the main city was situated on an island with walls reaching down to the sea, the Macedonian army could not take it by conventional means, resulting in a siege that lasted seven months.\n\nAlexander commanded his engineers to use the rubble from the abandoned mainland city of Old Tyre to construct a massive causeway connecting the shore to the island. Using siege engines mounted both on the causeway and on warships, they eventually breached the walls and stormed the city.

Persian scythed chariots also proved ineffective. Alexander repeated his tactic from Issus, leading his cavalry directly into a gap that opened in the Persian left flank and charging straight for Darius's command position.

Alexander advanced swiftly along the Royal Road from Susa to Persis, aiming for the capital Persepolis, denying the Persians time to regroup. Ariobarzanes, the satrap of Persis, considering that most elite troops had been lost at Gaugamela, decided to utilize the rugged terrain of the Persian mountain passes and the harsh winter weather to resist the invasion.\n\nAs Alexander led his army into the valley, he anticipated a possible counterattack, but the enemy's continued absence lulled him into a false sense of security. This was Ariobarzanes's trap. Once the Macedonian force was fully inside the narrow defile, he ordered his troops, concealed on the cliffs, to launch a sudden assault. They rained down boulders from above. The Macedonians, unable to form their shield wall under the barrage of falling rocks, suffered heavy casualties. For Alexander, this was the first time he had faced such dire straits in his military career. He immediately ordered a retreat, but troops in the rear, unaware of the situation ahead, continued to press forward. Ultimately, Alexander managed to withdraw to a flat area about six kilometers from the Persian Gate before halting, having sustained severe losses.\n\nAlthough Alexander could have bypassed the Persian Gate to invade Persis, he refused to admit defeat. He interrogated recently captured prisoners and finally learned from a Lycian shepherd of a narrow path leading behind Ariobarzanes's position. Under cover of night, Alexander began his maneuver. He left General Craterus with part of the army, ordering campfires to be kept burning to feign the army's continued presence. He also dispatched Ptolemy with a small force to ambush the Persian retreat route. Alexander personally led a picked force of light infantry, guided by the Lycian, along the path, reaching the rear of the Persian position by dawn. Alexander attacked from behind, while Craterus, upon receiving the signal, launched a frontal assault through the Persian Gate. Caught between two forces, the surprised Persians had no time to don armor or ready their weapons properly.\n\nSeeing the situation was hopeless, Ariobarzanes broke through with remnants of his force and fled towards Persepolis. Upon reaching the city, he was shocked to find it had betrayed him. Tiridates, the commander of Persepolis, having learned of the outcome at the Persian Gate, intended to surrender the city to Alexander. In despair, Ariobarzanes led his remaining troops in a final stand against the Macedonians. He and his entire force fought bravely to the last man. Soon after, Persepolis opened its gates and surrendered to the Macedonians. To exact revenge on the Persian Empire, Alexander ordered the city to be sacked and the royal palace set ablaze.\n\nThe Battle of the Persian Gate was the greatest challenge Alexander the Great ever faced and the Persian Empire's last stand.

The Indian cavalry, thrown into disarray, retreated towards their own elephants for protection. Macedonian infantry attacked the elephants and their crews with javelins and arrows. Under the elephants' charge and trampling, the Macedonian phalanx became disordered. Some Indian cavalry regrouped and engaged Alexander's cavalry once more but were again repulsed, retreating towards the elephants. Alexander's cavalry also pressed the enemy towards the center. In the ensuing melee, many elephants ran amok, stampeding in all directions. When the elephants charged Macedonian soldiers, they would retreat; when the elephants withdrew, they would advance and attack, hurling javelins at the beasts. In contrast, the Indian soldiers were hemmed in by Macedonian cavalry towards the center amidst the elephants, suffering heavy casualties.

# EDG_BDX_events.43.d:0 "The earliest Indo-Aryan ancestors in the Afghanistan region adhered to primitive Vedic Brahmanism. From the 7th to 6th centuries BC, Zoroaster founded Zoroastrianism. It is generally believed that Zoroastrianism first emerged in Afghanistan, as Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh. At that time, the region was known as Ariana, with Arachosia in the south being the heartland of Zoroastrianism. The Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta, were also transmitted from Arachosia to Persia. While most inhabitants of Afghanistan converted to Zoroastrianism, some people in the remote mountains of Badakhshan retained their primitive Brahmanic faith up to the present day. The area where they lived later became known to Muslims as Kafiristan, the 'Land of the Infidels'.\n\nAfter Alexander the Great's conquest of Bactria, he founded many cities named Alexandria as colonies for Greeks. Hellenistic polytheism was brought to this distant land by the Greeks, but its influence remained largely confined to these Greek colonial city-states and did not alter the local religious landscape.\n\nAfter Ashoka of the Maurya Empire embraced Buddhism, he allied with the Greek Seleucid Empire and received the lands of Afghanistan from them. He subsequently dedicated himself to dispatching missionaries to spread Buddhism westward. Under Mauryan influence, large populations in western India and the Hellenized kingdoms of Bactria converted to Buddhism, which even spread via the Western Regions to distant China. During this period, Greek culture merged with Buddhism, forming the unique art of Greco-Buddhism. After the collapse of the Maurya Empire, Menander I Soter, the conqueror of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (also known as King Milinda), continued the patronage of Buddhism. Menander questioned the Buddhist sage Nagasena (also known as Nagasena) on Buddhist doctrine, engaging in a series of philosophical dialogues. These conversations were compiled into the Milinda Panha (The Questions of King Milinda), which became an important Buddhist scripture.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the Yuezhi, who had conquered Greco-Bactria, invaded Afghanistan and northern India, establishing the Kushan Empire. They further promoted the flourishing of Buddhism. In the 3rd century AD, Afghanistan was again conquered by the Persian Sasanian Empire. Zoroastrianism's influence expanded in western Afghanistan, experiencing a revival, but it still failed to displace Buddhism as the mainstream faith."

# EDG_BDX_events.44.d:0 "For nearly a millennium after Ashoka, Buddhism remained the mainstream religion in Afghanistan, even after its conquest by the Caliphate. Within the Caliphate, Buddhism was considered a tolerated religion. Afghan Buddhists were granted 'dhimmi' status and permitted to practice their faith, with the Naubahar monastery in Balkh becoming a significant center of activity. After the Balkh revolt in the 8th century was suppressed by the Abbasid Caliphate, many Buddhists fled to Khotan and Tang China. The administrator of Naubahar converted to Islam and served as vizier to the Abbasids. Among his descendants, the most famous is Ja'far ibn Yahya, the Persian vizier and one of the protagonists in One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nIn the 11th century AD, Nasir Khusraw, a follower of the Nizari branch of Shia Ismailism, came to preach in Badakhshan, northwestern Afghanistan. Many residents, inspired by Nasir, converted to Ismailism, forming a stable Ismaili community in the region. Nasir Khusraw was revered by his followers as 'Shah Sayyid Nasir'. Nasir Khusraw, born in Balkh, was one of the most eminent theologians of the Fatimid Caliphate. His works, unusually composed in Persian rather than Arabic, include his famous travelogue, the 'Safarnama'.\n\nAfter the Abbasid Caliphate lost control over Afghanistan, the process of Islamization slowed temporarily. However, the rise of the Ghaznavid dynasty marked a crucial turning point. Although a Turkic dynasty, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni vigorously promoted Persian-Islamic culture and invited renowned Islamic scholars from around the world, aiming to establish Ghazni as a center of Islamic learning. During Sultan Mahmud's reign, the Muslim population in Afghanistan surpassed that of Buddhists, becoming the new mainstream faith.\n\nFollowing the decline of the Ghaznavids, the Gurids, who adhered to Mahayana Buddhism, defeated them and launched eastern campaigns, temporarily conquering northern India. Buddhism in Afghanistan and India experienced a brief revival. However, Gurid rule in India rapidly collapsed amid Mamluk revolts, and most of their Afghan territories were subsequently annexed by the rising Khwarazmian Shah Muhammad II. They eventually retained control only in the mountainous regions around Ghur and Bamiyan. During the Mongol conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire, Afghan Buddhist monasteries and artworks suffered severe destruction, delivering a fatal blow to the already declining local Buddhism. Although Buddhism briefly returned in the form of Tibetan Buddhism during Mongol rule, it was soon replaced by Christianity in Afghanistan. Today, Buddhism maintains influence only in the mountains of central and western regions.\n\nAfter Genghis Khan unified the Mongol steppes, the Christian Kerait and Naiman tribes, led by Khan Küchlüg, migrated westward and eventually settled in Faryab. During this process, many Christians remained in Afghanistan, some becoming missionaries spreading the Gospel within the Mongol-affiliated Islamic Kartid dynasty. Due to the religious tolerance policies of the Ilkhanate ruler Ghazan, Nestorian Christianity spread widely in Afghanistan, filling the ecological niche vacated by Buddhism. The Kartid Shah, influenced by missionaries, converted to Nestorianism and became a fervent promoter of the faith. Nestorianism gradually became mainstream in major Kartid cities, though most Pashtun tribes in remote areas retained their Islamic beliefs."

The Kushan Empire ushered in nearly two centuries of cultural flourishing and relative peace, known as the 'Pax Kushana'. They adapted the Greek alphabet to write their language and minted coins following Greek models. They also inherited the Greco-Buddhist tradition of the Bactrian Kingdom and vigorously patronized Buddhism, leading to its prosperity. Kushan art, including Buddhist statues, architecture, and carvings, heavily borrowed from Greek culture, forming the unique Gandharan style. During the reign of the great Kushan emperor Kanishka I, efforts were made to synthesize Buddhist thought from various schools, giving initial shape to Mahayana Buddhism. It is said the Buddhist treatise Mahavibhaṣa was compiled under his patronage. The Kushan Empire had multiple capitals, including Purushapura (modern Peshawar) in Gandhara, the important Greco-Indian city of Taxila, and the winter capital, Mathura.\n\nToday, following the footsteps of the Kushan Empire, we have conquered and rule northern India. But we shall not stop here; the entire Indian subcontinent shall be brought under our dominion. Prosperous India provides us with inexhaustible wealth.

In the Zoroastrian scripture Avesta, it is listed as one of the sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda. The earliest inhabitants of Bactria were Eastern Iranian-speaking peoples, and it was one of the early centers of Zoroastrianism. Later, it became a satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Before the Macedonians arrived, Bactria already had a significant Greek population, including Cyrenians exiled by the Persian Empire and Greek prisoners of war from Asia Minor.\n\nIn 327 BC, Alexander the Great conquered Bactria and founded numerous cities named Alexandria as colonies for Greeks. After Alexander's death, Bactria became a satrapy of the Seleucid Empire. In 246 BC, Diodotus I Soter, the satrap of Bactria, declared independence during the reign of Seleucid king Antiochus II Theos, establishing the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. After Diodotus I's death, his son Diodotus II succeeded him, allying with the Parthians against the Seleucids. He was later overthrown by Euthydemus I, an Ionian Greek. Under Euthydemus I's son, Demetrius I, the kingdom took advantage of the declining Maurya Empire to invade India, conquering vast territories in northwestern India and moving the capital to Taxila.\n\nAfter Demetrius I's death, Eucratides I the Great overthrew the Euthydemid dynasty, usurping the Bactrian throne and plunging into civil war with the Indo-Greek Kingdom controlled by Demetrius II of the Euthydemid line. This conflict led to the decline of the Bactrian Kingdom. Although Eucratides I defeated the latter, he was eventually repelled by the Indo-Greek king Menander I Soter. During the civil strife, the Bactrian Kingdom was attacked and defeated by the Parthian Empire, losing significant territory. Eucratides I was assassinated on the battlefield, widely believed to have been killed by his own son. Ultimately, the Bactrian Kingdom fell to the invading Yuezhi.\n\nThe Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was deeply influenced by Greek culture. The Bactrians used a modified Greek alphabet to write their Eastern Iranian language and, following Greek tradition, issued vast quantities of coins bearing images of their rulers and Greek deities. Under Mauryan influence, many Bactrians converted to Buddhism. During this period, numerous depictions of the Buddha influenced by Greek artistic styles emerged, particularly realistic Buddha sculptures, which profoundly impacted the later Kushan Empire. The Han dynasty envoy Zhang Qian, on his mission to the Western Regions, visited the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which is referred to as 'Daxia' in the Records of the Grand Historian.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bactria was once lost to the tides of history.

Nizar fled Cairo and rebelled in Alexandria but was defeated and killed. Supporters of Nizar, led by Hasan-i Sabbah, seized the mountain fortress of Alamut in northern Persia as their base, founding the 'Order of Assassins' and engaging in assassination campaigns. During the Mongol westward expansion, the Assassins' attempt to assassinate Möngke Khan brought them into conflict with the Mongols, leading to their eventual destruction by Hulagu Khan. Nasir Khusraw, one of the Fatimid Caliphate's most eminent theologians, came to Badakhshan to preach, leading to the conversion of large numbers of Badakhshanis to Isma'ilism, forming a stable Isma'ili community. In the Isma'ili schism caused by Fatimid internal strife, Badakhshan became a stronghold of the Nizari branch, and after the destruction of the Assassins, it became the primary surviving Nizari community."

Menander questioned the Buddhist sage Nagasena (also known as Nagasena) on Buddhist doctrine, engaging in a series of philosophical dialogues. These conversations were compiled into the Milinda Panha (The Questions of King Milinda), which became an important Buddhist scripture.

Seleucia was a Hellenistic city founded by Seleucus I Nicator, and Ctesiphon was the capital of the Parthian and Sasanian Persian Empires, both located on the banks of the Tigris River south of Baghdad. Around the 3rd century AD, Christians within Persia gradually formed an independent ecclesiastical structure. Around 280 AD, the Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was recognized as the head of the entire Persian Church. The Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410 formally established this status, bestowing the title of Catholicos or Patriarch of the East. Thereafter, the patriarchate's jurisdiction expanded widely, from Mesopotamia to Central Asia, India, and even to the Nestorian Church in Tang China. Due to its support for Nestorian doctrine following the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon split from the Roman Church, becoming an independent Christian center within the Persian civilization sphere."

EDG_BDX_mevlevi_holy_order_desc:0 "The Mevlevi Order is a Sunni Sufi order founded in the 13th century, originating in Konya, the capital of the Sultanate of Rum. Its founder was the Persian poet and jurist Rumi. Rumi advocated placing the love of God above all else, rather than rigidly adhering to dogma. The most distinctive feature of the Mevlevi Order is the whirling ceremony during prayer; followers believe this practice facilitates a connection with God, earning them the name 'Whirling Dervishes'. The Mevlevi Order holds significant influence among the Turks of Anatolia."
EDG_BDX_qadiri_holy_order:0 "Qadiriyya Order"
EDG_BDX_qadiri_holy_order_desc:0 "The Qadiriyya Order is a Sunni Sufi order founded in the 13th century by the Hanbali scholar Abdul Qadir Gilani. Qadir was born in Gilan, Iran, and later traveled to Baghdad to study Islamic law. After completing his studies, he wandered the deserts of Iraq for 25 years, eventually returning to Baghdad in his later years to teach Hadith and combine Islamic jurisprudence with mysticism. Although Qadir belonged to the Hanbali school, he placed the jurisprudence of the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools on equal footing, issuing fatwas based on both, leading people to regard him as a Sheikh of both Hanbalism and Shafi'ism. The Qadiriyya Order emphasizes inner purification and divine love, profoundly influencing figures such as Nur al-Din and Saladin. The order survived the Mongol conquest of Baghdad and spread widely, with branches extending west to Morocco and Mali, and east to China, spanning the globe."

EDG_BDX_naqshbandi_holy_order_desc:0 "The Naqshbandi Order is a Sunni Sufi order founded in the 14th century by Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, a Tajik from Bukhara. Naqshband opposed excessive asceticism and ecstatic rituals, placing great emphasis on Islamic jurisprudence and spiritual communication between master and disciple. His words and deeds were compiled by his disciples, and he was buried in Bukhara after his death. The term 'Naqshband' means 'painter' in Persian, named for the practice of members tracing lines on their chests with their fingers while silently reciting the Quran to dispel distractions and envision the perfect inner state of God. The Naqshbandi Order was the dominant Islamic sect in the Timurid Empire and holds significant influence in India and China as well."

EDG_BDX_safavi_holy_order_desc:0 "The Safavid Order was a Shi'a Sufi order founded in the 13th century by Safi al-Din Ardabili. Safi al-Din was born in Ardabil, Azerbaijan, into a family of Kurdish origin. He later became the son-in-law and successor of the Sufi master Zahid Gilani of Lahijan, reforming Zahid's Zahidiyya order into the Safavid Order. Under Safi al-Din and his descendants, the Safavid Order gradually developed into a significant political force in Azerbaijan and began establishing a state. The order adhered to Twelver Shi'ism, with hereditary leadership, considering the order's leader to be the representative of the Hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, on Earth, with some radical propaganda even identifying the leader as al-Mahdi himself."

EDG_BDX_mushasha_holy_order_desc:0 "The Musha'sha' Order was a Shi'a Sufi order founded in the 15th century by the Iraqi theologian Muhammad ibn Falah. Ibn Falah was born in Huwayza, Iraq, and later traveled to Hilla for theological studies. It was during this time that he began to believe he was the representative of Imam Ali and al-Mahdi on Earth, compiling his theological views into the Kalam al-Mahdi (Discourse of the Mahdi). He claimed descent from the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kazim, and established the Musha'sha' Order with Huwayza as its base. The order attracted many followers through fervent millenarianism and Islamic eschatology, becoming a significant force in Khuzestan and engaging in prolonged conflict with the Safavid Order."

Bektash was born in Nishapur, Khorasan, and was initially a follower of the Yasawiyya order before arriving in the Sultanate of Rum. The Bektashi adherents follow a Shi'a sect called Alevism, which incorporates Bektashi thought, blending Twelver Shi'ism with Tengrist traditions of the nomads. The Bektashi Order particularly venerates Ali, even considering the Prophet Muhammad and Ali as one. The Ottoman Janissaries adopted the Bektashi Order as their official religious order."

After the death of the eighth Fatimid Caliph and Imam al-Mustansir Billah, Vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah manipulated the succession, deposing the designated heir, the eldest son Nizar ibn al-Mustansir, and installing Nizar's brother al-Musta'li as the new Caliph. Nizar fled Cairo and rebelled in Alexandria but was defeated and killed. Supporters of Nizar, led by Hasan-i Sabbah, seized the mountain fortress of Alamut in northern Persia as their base, founding the 'Order of Assassins' and engaging in assassination campaigns. During the Mongol westward expansion, the Assassins' attempt to assassinate Möngke Khan brought them into conflict with the Mongols, leading to their eventual destruction by Hulagu Khan. Although the Assassins were destroyed, supporters of Nizar scattered across the world, with Badakhshan becoming the primary stronghold of the Nizari branch."

Muhammad and his son §YIskandar§! have long ruled this distant land with benevolence, yet they have never abandoned the dream of restoring the glory of the House of Argead.\n\n§OBadakshan§!\n§YBadakshan§! is famed for producing a ruby known as 'Balas,' renowned for its dazzling crimson hue. Merchants transport these rubies along the 'Ruby Road,' part of the Silk Road, selling them across the world.\nAs a crossroads of Asia, Badakshan commands the juncture of Iran-Turan, the Indian subcontinent, and the East. Yet, surrounded by mountains, it remains isolated, fostering an exceptionally diverse and complex array of religious and cultural communities. The Indo-Aryan ancestors of the Badakhshani people followed Zoroaster into the faith of §YZoroastrianism§!. During Alexander the Great's eastern campaigns, Badakhshan was incorporated into the §YGreco-Bactrian Kingdom§!, undergoing a prolonged period of §YHellenization§!. Under the influence of the Mauryan Empire, many Bactrians converted to §YBuddhism§!, which remained the dominant faith in Badakhshan for over a millennium. After conquest by the Caliphate, though Buddhists were granted 'dhimmi' status, Buddhism inevitably declined.

In the 11th century AD, the Fatimid §YIsmaili§! scholar §YNasir Khusraw§! came to Badakhshan as a missionary, establishing a resilient Ismaili community that gradually became predominant.

Meanwhile, to the north on the steppes, the Uzbek Khanate's §YAbu'l-Khayr Khan§! watches intently, waiting for his moment. In this conflict, Badakhshan cannot remain untouched.
