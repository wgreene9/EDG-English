EDG_ENG_mission_1_2_desc:0 "Normandy was the dowry brought to England by William the Conqueror and his descendants, belonging to our supreme king and serving as England's direct springboard into France and all of Europe. Yet today, Normandy has become the den of a shameless traitor claiming the throne. Normandy today, perhaps, is no longer a place of glory and strength, shrouded by disgraceful betrayal. Will England truly pass into his hands? But regardless, we shall defend our kingdom and protect our traditions with unwavering will and unparalleled strength until the very end. May our throne remain unshaken after our choice is made!"

EDG_ENG_mission_1_3_title:0 "Continental Disputes"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_3_desc:0 "England possesses a significant geographical advantage: the narrow Strait of Dover between Dover and Calais neither hinders England's involvement in continental affairs nor fails to protect England's 'detached' status during times of weakness. The Duke of Alençon, once loyal to Paris, has now sworn fealty to us, and the rebellious royal uncle in Normandy has proven his followers to be mere rabble. Now that the flames of war in Normandy have been extinguished, it is time to proclaim to the monarchs of Christendom—'England has returned.'"

EDG_ENG_mission_1_5_title:0 "Tethering Brittany"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_5_desc:0 "'Brittany'—or more evocatively, 'Little Britain'—is the projection of Great Britain onto the continent. For a long time, Brittany served as a trade hub between mutually wary France and England, reaping considerable profits. However, as tensions rise in France, with both north and south eager to display their ambitions, Brittany urgently needs to find a protector. Of course, they have no choice but England."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_6_title:0 "Establish the Royal Navy"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_6_desc:0 "In the ancient Greco-Persian Wars, it was the Athenians' 'Wooden Wall' that enabled the weak Greek city-states to ultimately defeat the Persians. England's naval power has long been key to its maritime dominance. Yet in recent years, due to neglect and accumulated deficiencies, the Royal Navy's strength has significantly declined. To reassert England's position at sea, the Royal Navy must be vigorously developed. This requires not only massive investment in constructing new warships but also a corps of brave and skilled English sea warriors to defend their Albion."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_7_title:0 "Patrol the Channel"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_7_desc:0 "Many vessels sailing the English Channel are not bound for England. Numerous Genoese ships, also flying the flag of Saint George, sail from Southern Europe to the prosperous Low Countries, trading Italian olive oil for exquisite artworks to enrich their lords' collections. However, while docking at English ports for supplies, they often send English crew members ashore, pretending to be English to evade tariffs. It was only when an English envoy stationed in the Netherlands discovered this that London finally realized the truth. Naturally, the primary fault lies with the Genoese. Yet, this incident also drew England's attention to the wealth of the Low Countries, so close at hand. The English hope to reach a tariff agreement with Low Countries rulers they deem more 'friendly.' The Low Countries would need to levy an additional tax on the English behalf from the Genoese, and in return, the English would provide more elusive 'diplomatic support.' But will the Low Countries really sign such an agreement?"

EDG_ENG_mission_1_8_title:0 "Influence the Low Countries"
EDG_ENG_mission_1_8_desc:0 "Even just watching the multitude of sails come and go for a single day from a port on the Thames reveals how fervent the economic and trade relations between England and the Low Countries have become. English lords enjoy exquisite silverware crafted in Antwerp, while Dutch textile workshops are filled with flax from Wessex. Yet, for the King of England, such a wealthy region not being under his control is a tremendous waste. From the ramparts of the White Tower, His Majesty the King's eyes seem to gaze across the waves of the North Sea, shimmering with desire for the Low Countries. Standing by the Thames, looking out at the distant ports and merchant ships, his ambition grows ceaselessly. This rich land must be ruled only by those who submit to me; if no such person exists, it must be ruled by the English."

EDG_ENG_mission_1_10_title:0 "The Franglois Channel" # The Channel of Frangleterre
EDG_ENG_mission_1_10_desc:0 "In the gentle light of dawn, the Kingdom of Frangleterre stands proudly by the English Channel, its ruler rewriting the pages of history, merging the legacies of the Kingdoms of England and France. In this land of convergence, trade vessels shuttle back and forth, laden with rich goods and cultural exchange. Henceforth, above the Channel, a single kingdom's banner flies, proclaiming complete mastery over trade. In this hopeful and vibrant nation, people celebrate the arrival of a new era, praising the kingdom's ruler. The ocean's waves and the wind's song accompany their journeys as steadfast companions. In the city's streets, merchants cheer the advent of prosperity. At the docks, ships brim with diverse cargo, and the treasure-laden markets become symbols of civilization and wealth. The English Channel becomes a bridge connecting the world and the starting point for Frangleterre's global journey. In this land, people remember past glories and look forward to future brilliance, knowing that in this kingdom, they will forever possess a harbor of freedom and prosperity."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_1_title:0 "Escape the Baronial Wars" # Breaking the Shackles of the Baronial Wars
EDG_ENG_mission_2_1_desc:0 "John Lackland may be the first in English history to be notorious for his ill repute. A king defeated by his own earls and barons had a profound impact on the Kingdom of England. Countless earls disregarded London's decrees. It took generations of English kings to gradually restore control over the Midlands. Even as England remained fragmented, history's relentless tide no longer allowed England to continue dithering. England faces its greatest crisis in a century, but conversely, this is also heaven-sent opportunity for England's rebirth from ashes. If they do not offer loyalty, then the shackles of the past can only be turned upon themselves. At this moment, the King of England confronts not only internal division but also external threats. France's decadent monarchy and the Gaels in the north watch with predatory eyes. England must resist these threats with unity and resilience; otherwise, it will cease to exist."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_2_title:0 "Control Parliament"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_2_desc:0 "The bloated and complacent lords in Parliament are merely tools for local barons to constrain the king. Over the past century, they have reveled in boasting about how many ambitious and diligent kings they have obstructed. But they should have long learned to know their place. Parliament exists to serve the king's rule, not the rule of the lords. They immerse themselves in self-satisfaction, arrogantly seeing themselves as the king's judges. However, the king's voice will once again resound through the halls of Parliament. Then, they will have to bow and obey, understanding who truly holds dominion."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_4_title:0 "Invade France"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_4_desc:0 "Any English designs on the continent cannot exist independently of campaigns against France. Normandy directly faces the core of the Kingdom of France; from Caen to Paris, there are no natural barriers to hinder progress. The Capetian dynasty in Paris has been incompetent for far too long, their sole method of ruling France being to allow their relatives to act as they please. Their disgraceful two major defeats against the Arlesian heretics have made them the best target for attacking Catholicism. If they have grown weary of ruling France, the English are more than willing to take up this burden. England's ambitions extend beyond merely replacing Capetian rule; their deeper goal is to establish their own hegemony on the European continent. They know well that controlling France will open the door to all of Europe. Moreover, they see the chaos and turmoil within France as a perfect opportunity to exploit. Their military strength, political acumen, and diplomatic relations with other European powers provide a solid foundation for this grand ambition. Therefore, for England, becoming France's new master is not merely a fleeting ambition but an inevitable path to continental dominance. In this great game, whoever controls France can sit firmly on Europe's throne of power. And England is determined to succeed."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_5_title:0 "Fleur-de-Lis Crown" # The Fleur-de-Lis Crown
EDG_ENG_mission_2_5_desc:0 "The French Fleur-de-Lis Crown gleams resplendently, as if recounting past glories and sorrows, bearing countless stories and legends. It is not merely a precious artifact but a symbol of the complex history between two nations. We can choose to use it as a symbol of ruling France, consolidating our power, but must also be aware that it may provoke discontent and resistance against our rule. On the other hand, sending it as a trophy to the Kingdom of England might strengthen our relations with England, yet could also incite anger and resentment among the French people. Faced with such a choice, we must deliberate deeply, considering what impact our actions will have on the future relations between the two nations."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_6_title:0 "End Arles"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_6_desc:0 "As the farcical drama of the Cathar Kingdom of Arles in the south nears its end, the King of England, wearing his newly acquired French crown, stands filled with ambition, ready to launch a final sweep against the heretics of Occitania. This English ruler stands at the peak of power, like a majestic lion, his sharp gaze sweeping over every inch of land, prepared to eradicate those heretics who dare challenge his authority. This is more like a righteous judgment; he will make those who have strayed from the faith and disrupted order pay the due price. Under his iron hoof, the land trembles, while the heretics face a trial of life and death, and Occitania will become the battlefield for the decisive confrontation."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_8_title:0 "Anglo-French United Crown" # The Anglo-French United Crown
EDG_ENG_mission_2_8_desc:0 "In the past, France, allied with Scotland, was England's greatest threat, but today it no longer poses a danger. Continuing to spread hostile rhetoric against the French as in the past is clearly no longer appropriate. William the Conqueror once came from across the Channel to become England's master, and today the Conqueror's descendant has conquered his former overlord. The English must learn to act like the French, to speak the French language; the two nations are no longer enemies."

EDG_ENG_mission_2_9_title:0 "The Unified Frangleterre"
EDG_ENG_mission_2_9_desc:0 "Dear subjects, today is a glorious and solemn day, a moment marking a historic turning point. I stand here bearing a great mission, representing the two great nations of England and France to usher in a new era and create a powerful, united Kingdom of Frangleterre. The land upon which we stand has witnessed countless conflicts, but today we will end past hostilities and unite our strengths into a formidable force. As your monarch, I will do my utmost to protect and prosper our kingdom. I shall lead this nation with justice, courage, and wisdom, ensuring every subject enjoys peace, prosperity, and happiness. Let us forge a better, more prosperous Kingdom of Frangleterre. May heaven bless our kingdom; may our kingdom prosper forever! May the Kingdom of Frangleterre be as enduring as the sun and moon, as unshakable as the mountains!"

EDG_ENG_mission_3_2_title:0 "Purge the Lollards"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The Godwin family of East Anglia is not only the first to feign compliance while secretly defying the state, but they also openly maintain a Lollard Council within their domains. Their territory hangs like the Sword of Damocles over London. If they are allowed to collude with England's enemies, His Majesty and his government will face war directly. However, conversely, they are close to us, and we are close to them—close enough to launch a surprise attack without prior detection. Only by teaching these heretics a lesson can London be secure."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_3_title:0 "Restore Authority" # Restore Dynastic Authority
EDG_ENG_mission_3_3_desc:0 "Enemies on all four borders of England have been swept away. Those dukes who hoarded military power and merchants obsessed with wealth have surrendered their authority. The whole of England has been renewed. Officials dispatched by the king have begun assuming local control, organizing land and population registers to replace the obviously outdated 'Domesday Book,' and starting to collect accumulated back taxes. Soon after, the king ordered the establishment of a new constabulary responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the law. England's great power is now firmly in the king's hands."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_5_title:0 "Pluck the Harp"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_5_desc:0 "Ireland is within arm's reach of Great Britain. Their connections to the European continent must pass through us (just as England faces France directly). That young High King deserves our admiration, but we also know well that even in Ireland's deep pools, turbulent waves still surge. A young, wise monarch can unite a divided nation, yet risks losing his way amidst the waves. It is time to prove to the Irish who is more suited to lead them."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_7_title:0 "Aid the Irish"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_7_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our armies are not widely welcomed in Ireland. Even worse, the Irish view us like beasts. Many Irish are unwilling to live on land not belonging to the Irish, and among them, an ancient Viking legend circulates about a distant 'land abundant with grapes.' However, thankfully, most Irish are unwilling to believe such a fanciful tale. Even for the necessities of governance, we must rebuild Ireland, which lies gasping amidst the ravages of war."

EDG_ENG_mission_3_8_title:0 "The Crown of Ulster"
EDG_ENG_mission_3_8_desc:0 "In the passage of time, England has brought blessings and benefits to Ireland. Although initially fraught with struggle and harshness, as years accumulated, this lingering sentiment gave rise to a destined bond, composing a deep and affectionate love song. Like a clear spring, this land has moved away from the shadows of war and chaos, hand in hand toward the shores of peace and unity. Through a strong central government and an effective administrative system, Ireland achieved unification and integration, displaying new vitality and vigor, flourishing grandly. Amidst the Irish royalist supporters, a crown adorned with emeralds, forged in Ulster, was presented to the king, symbolizing Ireland's submission."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_1_title:0 "Rebuild the Royal Army"
EDG_ENG_mission_4_1_desc:0 "After the Magna Carta, for a long time, English kings struggled to maintain a large, well-trained standing army like that of Richard the Lionheart's era. Instead, they had ceremonial troops composed of bankrupt peasants and urban riffraff—such units had no discipline, charging last and looting first. It is time to recruit troops from good families once more and rebuild a true royal standing army."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_2_title:0 "End Borough Privileges" # End Autonomous Privileges
EDG_ENG_mission_4_2_desc:0 "England's autonomous cities frantically attempt to emulate the Free Cities of the Holy Roman Empire. Merchants form their own governments to manage England's strategic transportation hubs; gold and silver flow through merchants' hands; cities become thoroughfares for the countryside. But they overlook one point: England has never been an absurdly fragile state like the Holy Roman Empire. The so-called free cities they cherish, if they disobey the king's decrees, are but corrupted Sodom and Gomorrah, destined to be consumed by God's fire."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_4_title:0 "The Celtic Border Threat"
EDG_ENG_mission_4_4_desc:0 "When Emperor Hadrian built his wall, the Roman Empire knew the Celts north of the Great Wall coveted the wealthy province of Britannia. Ten centuries later, King Alexander of Scotland similarly does not hide his ambition to intervene in England. He is sharpening his weapons and gathering capable armies to march south and strike at the passes. However, unlike Hadrian facing the Celts, King Alexander faces an England that is not unprepared. London has long heard of Scotland's ambitions and knows war is imminent. A war to decide the fate of Albion is about to erupt."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_5_title:0 "Manage Northumbria" # Manage Northumberland
EDG_ENG_ENG_mission_4_5_desc:0 "In the English court, the Umfraville family of Northumberland is synonymous with shamelessness and double-dealing. Not only do they hold great power in Scotland, even meddling with the clown king they selected through a farcical process, but they also dared to self-proclaim themselves as Dukes of Northumberland without receiving the English king's investiture. This is tantamount to tap-dancing upon His Majesty's crown. It is time to march ten thousand troops to the North Sea's shore and sever one head of this two-headed serpent."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_6_title:0 "Tame the Red Lion"
EDG_ENG_mission_4_6_desc:0 "For centuries past, England's Golden Lion and Scotland's Red Lion have clashed fiercely over their territories. Due to a significant population advantage, the Golden Lion often held the upper hand. However, the Golden Lion's family fell into strife between father and son; stray cubs no longer obeyed the Lion King's commands. Northumberland, closest to the Red Lion, has thrown in its lot with him. It is time to tell those presumptuous lions who possesses the sharper claws, to win complete vindication and prove to all Christendom who is the true master of this island."

EDG_ENG_mission_4_7_title:0 "Secure the Lowland" # Secure Lowland Scotland
EDG_ENG_mission_4_7_desc:0 "Dealing with the Scots requires a divide-and-rule approach. Compared to those stubborn, obstinate Highlanders, the Lowland Scots are clearly more reasonable. The language and customs of the Edinburgh folk have been influenced by the English for many years. With some minor inducements, the Lowland Scots will certainly understand that following the English is the best course."

England's glory, Scotland's bravery, are etched into the river of history as an undying epic.\n\nRising from turbulent times, the roar of England's lion, soaring alongside the northern falcon, marching boldly forward. In Scotland's vast lands lie the sons of freedom, inspiring every warrior to press ahead without retreat.\n\nThus, tides converge, destinies meet, the power of monarchs unites the vast land, cheers resound to the heavens, and the entire earth is moved.\n\nNow, walking side by side, England and Scotland, poets praise their splendor, extol their glory. Under a unified banner, united as one, unbreakable."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_2_title:0 "Rein in Lancaster"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_2_desc:0 "As the House of Lancaster no longer possesses an heir eligible to inherit, the Duchy of Lancaster has ultimately been left as a legacy to our most esteemed Majesty. Yet, although the Duchy of Lancaster also honors our most respected Majesty as their duke, they still attempt to operate independently outside the kingdom's administrative system. They remain unwilling to answer the king's summons. 'The heavens are high and the king far away; as long as the duke is not in Lancashire, there is no duke.' This fractured relationship should have been ended long ago."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_3_title:0 "Tame York"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_3_desc:0 "The House of York has been presumptuous for too long, to the point they genuinely believe they alone are the masters of Yorkshire.

However, our magnanimous Majesty has decided to give them a chance to serve. Nevertheless, if they refuse the toast, they will have to drink the penalty."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_5_desc:0 "The Welsh are evidently overly confident in those hills known as the Welsh Marches. Even a true wall cannot withstand the elite soldiers of the Kingdom of England. We are resolved to incorporate Wales into England's territory. However, out of goodwill toward the Welsh, our most promise-keeping Majesty has pledged to them: 'Wales shall be ruled by someone born in Wales whose first spoken word was Welsh.'"

EDG_ENG_mission_5_7_title:0 "Pacify the Gaels"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_7_desc:0 "In the resistance of the Gaelic lords of the Scottish Highlands, we should deeply comprehend their love for their homeland and dedication to cultural heritage. The Highlands in their eyes are not just land but imprints of memory, traces of ancestral blood flowing across that soil. Pacification is not weakness but wisdom and breadth of mind. Amidst the shifting tides of history, we should embrace understanding, touch the ancient Stone of Scone with a warm hand, and listen to the thunder of the north with an inclusive heart. Only then can we find a path to reconciliation in conflict, allowing mutual sentiments to flow like a river."

EDG_ENG_mission_5_8_title:0 "The Crown of Lothian"
EDG_ENG_mission_5_8_desc:0 "In the northern Highlands of Scotland, mountains overlap, lakes are clear as mirrors, and millennia of legends and resistance weave a splendid tapestry across this land. The wheel of fate seems to have long destined its outcome. The English rulers, with hands of power and wealth, gradually extended their influence into northern Scotland. They dispatched their most elite armies to suppress this rebellious territory. The resistance leader, the Duke of Lothian, and his warriors fought valiantly, but in the relentless war, their strength slowly waned. Ultimately, the Duke of Lothian realized that no amount of courage and determination could withstand the rulers' iron heels. In a desperate moment, he made a shocking decision—to cease resistance and present Scotland's treasure. The Scottish crown, crafted from rubies and gold, once the pride and dignity of this land, now became the final note of northern Scotland's resistance. When the crown was handed to the English ruler, the Duke of Lothian gazed southward with deep emotion, his proud head no longer held high."

He decides to build a royal palace to display the splendor of the monarchy. Thus, the towering Edinburgh Palace will rise from the earth, standing under the vast sky, passing on England's glory among the mountains and rivers. The King of England issues an edict, decreeing that future generations must regularly come to this palace for summer retreats (in other words, to truly rule Scotland)."
