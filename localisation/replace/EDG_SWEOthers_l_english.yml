EDG_uppsala_domkyrka_desc:0 "Uppsala Cathedral, construction of which began in 1287, is the oldest church in Northern Europe and the largest cathedral in Scandinavia. The exterior of the building is predominantly red, featuring two towering spires visible from afar. The interior is resplendent and renowned for its rich collection of artifacts.

EDG_drottningholms_slott:0 "Drottningholm Palace"
EDG_drottningholms_slott_desc:0 "Drottningholm Palace is the private residence of the Swedish royal family, located on the island of Lovön in Lake Mälaren, west of Stockholm. Construction of the magnificent Drottningholm Palace began in 1537, commissioned by the Swedish king for his queen. However, the queen passed away before its completion. After a fire in 1661, it was rebuilt. The majority of its architecture is in the Baroque style. From a distance, one can take in the natural landscapes surrounding Stockholm, while a closer look reveals the meticulous arrangement of every room in the palace. Today, it serves as the location of the Swedish Royal Academy."

EDG_SWE_electing_council:0 "Swedish Elective Monarchy"
EDG_SWE_electing_council_desc:0 "Historically, Sweden maintained a system of three-estates assemblies. Kings were elected or deposed by provincial parliaments, and it was stipulated that the king could not rule autocratically but must obey the resolutions of the assemblies. Even during the Kalmar Union period, the parliament remained Sweden's direct governing body—determining the regent within the personal union through election. This also meant that the Kalmar Union could never fully integrate the Swedish crown."

EDG_SWE_Monarchy:0 "Swedish Monarchy"
EDG_SWE_Monarchy_desc:0 "Following Gustav Vasa's centralization reforms, the provincial parliaments' right to elect kings was completely abolished. Sweden was formally transformed into a monarchy, with the parliament restructured to serve the king, assisting in handling various affairs."

EDG_SWE_council:0 "Three-Estates Parliament"
EDG_SWE_council_desc:0 "Since the 9th century, Sweden has established a three-tiered system of popular assemblies: village assemblies, parish assemblies, and provincial assemblies. These assemblies convened periodically to discuss and decide matters within their respective scopes, such as establishing village regulations, resolving disputes, determining sowing and harvesting times, and when Viking ships would set sail. An important task of the provincial assemblies was to elect or depose the king."
