EDG_mission_LOT_1_2_desc:0 "Lotharingia is built upon an ancient and fragile feudal system, with conflicts between Francophone and Germanophone nobles nearly tearing our court and lands asunder. Compared to the Francophone nobles who are closer to the royal court, the Germanophone nobles feel no sense of belonging to us; indeed, they yearn to join their Germanic Emperor. Before we can reaffirm our Frankish inheritance, we must pacify the Germans to prevent them from exploiting our misfortunes."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_3_title:0 "Appease the Archbishops"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_3_desc:0 "In 1349, the great Ludwig III brought vast territories of the Rhineland under the Carolingian Crown, including the illustrious Prince-Elector Archbishoprics of Cologne and Trier. While the conquests of the late king are commendable, a century of prolonged internal strife has prevented the royal court from fully consolidating control over these lands. As a result, the Duke of Berg—the bastard son of 'Child' Louis—now seeks to control the two great bishoprics and, through them, dominate our German subjects in opposition to the Crown. It is not too late to mend our fences; let us preemptively win them over, so that the Holy Church may aid us, rather than conspirators, in balancing the power of the Germans."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_6_desc:0 "In the year 942, the King of Lotharingia sent troops to aid the Duke of Burgundy against West Francia, yet in the end, we not only lost our Burgundian ally but also saw the prosperous Flanders seized by the French king. Today, though West Francia has been replaced by the Capetian Kingdom of France, the fall of Flanders and Burgundy remains a national humiliation for Lotharingia. Now, Queen Bernadette, having just quelled a rebellion of the nobles, urgently needs to prove her capabilities. Through diplomatic efforts and arranging marriages between Lotharingian nobility and the children of Burgundian lords to rebuild the old alliance, a fine opportunity presents itself."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_7_desc:0 "The successive monarchs of the Capetian dynasty, especially Hugh VII 'the Victorious', have consistently worked to strengthen central authority, thereby breeding discontent among many nobles. We shall exploit this weakness of our enemy, gladly accepting the support of the French aristocracy, reaffirming Lotharingia's inheritance rights as stipulated in the Treaty of Caen, abolishing the Capetian dynasty, and inheriting the legacy of West Francia to become the sole 'Successor of the Franks'."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_8_title:0 "Reclaim Brittany"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_8_desc:0 "Brittany, or 'Little Britain,' the last stronghold of the Celts on the European continent, was a land even our ancestor Charlemagne could not fully subjugate. The Bretons have long prided themselves as the true 'Gauls,' preserving many martial customs and military traditions dating back to ancient Roman times. As conquerors of grand ambition, let us also learn from the wisdom of these Celts."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_10_desc:0 "Since the Kingdom of Lombardy fell to the Golden Disaster, her fertile lands have been fragmented, mostly ruled by usurpers with dubious claims. If we can cross the Alpine mountains and return to the ancestral Italian soil, we will undoubtedly provide stronger and more legitimate leadership for them, while also establishing an imperial outpost."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_12_desc:0 "In the year 855, the Treaty of Prüm forced Lombardy and Lotharingia to go their separate ways. Since then, the Iron Crown of Lombardy has been stolen and usurped by the despicable Germans. Now, as the Lotharingian Empire is reborn and flourishing, while the city-states of Northern Italy are ravaged by war and decay, we must claim the remaining lands of Lothair, intervene in the Italian Wars, personally save the people of this land, and become the new Philosopher-King of Lombardy."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_13_title:0 "No Longer Alone"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_13_desc:0 "The victory in Genoa has allowed the Lotharingians to once again gaze upon the azure shores of Liguria. Much like Charlemagne of old, Bernadette the 'White Rose' reflected from horseback upon the tenderness and beauty of the Mediterranean—a splendor unmatched by the narrow seas. The Empress believes that from Genoa to Romagna, to Sicily, and on to the Levant, Lotharingia shall eventually rule the entire Mediterranean, just as the Roman Empire once did."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_15_title:0 "Dismantle the Papal States"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_15_desc:0 "The heart of Italy, from Ravenna to Umbria, is controlled by the Papal States—a unique political entity originating from lands donated by Pippin, the first Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty, nearly a millennium ago. Prolonged isolation has gradually corrupted the Papacy; the subordinate states under its authority now enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Within Rome, numerous powerful aristocratic families have formed, while cardinals and parish priests engage in scheming and self-serving machinations. Even the Holy See itself is manipulated by these avaricious degenerates. Out of concern for the purity of the Catholic faith and the safety of the Pope himself, the Emperor of the Romans, [Root.Monarch.GetName], must correct Pippin's choice of old, dismantle the Papal States, reclaim central Italy, and personally protect the Holy Father."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_17_desc:0 "The bloody curtain of the Vespers centuries ago tore the fertile island of Trinacria away from the embrace of the Holy Father, leaving it under the sway of the despicable Greeks. As the guardian of the Catholic world, we must put an end to the farcical political games on Sicily, reestablish the Kingdom of Sicily, and reverse the night of the Vespers."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_19_title:0 "Reform the Feudal System"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_19_desc:0 "Under the current feudal system, the German princes possess excessive independence, not only obeying the Crown's calls while ignoring its proclamations but even harboring ambitions of their own. We cannot allow medieval conspiracies to replay repeatedly in Lotharingia. The outdated institutions must be reformed, and the power of the German princes must be suppressed with an iron hand."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_20_title:0 "Reform Feudalism"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_20_desc:0 "The old Frankish feudal system has proven obsolete. While ensuring the removal of certain unreasonable aristocratic privileges, we must explore a new system suitable for the contemporary conditions of Lotharingia—whether by following the path of our predecessors to subdue the princes or by exercising patience for the nation's unity to rally the great nobles."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_22_title:0 "House of Lords"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_22_desc:0 "The House of Lords is one of the two chambers of the Lotharingian Parliament, evolving from medieval councils that advised the monarch. Its members include descendants of the royal family, hereditary peers, life peers, justices of the Court of Appeal, as well as archbishops and bishops of the Church. The archbishops and bishops serve as the 'Lords Spiritual,' while the royal descendants, hereditary peers, life peers, and justices are the 'Lords Temporal.' Lords Spiritual retain their seats as long as they hold their ecclesiastical offices and are commonly referred to as 'Parliamentary Nobility,' whereas Lords Temporal hold their positions for life. The House of Lords system standardizes and differentiates aristocratic power, serving as a milestone in Lotharingia's centralization efforts."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_25_desc:0 "The winds of the Renaissance from the southern foothills of the Alps have reached the heart of Francia, sparking a great wave of educational expansion in Lotharingia later known as the 'Lotharingian Educational Movement.' The most representative events of this movement were the successive establishment of the 'Eight Great Institutes of Lotharingia,' including the University of Bernadette, ultimately establishing Lotharingia as the academic and cultural center of Europe."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_29_desc:0 "Under the decades-long stewardship of the Carolingian dynasty, Lotharingia's agriculture, devastated in the Four Nations' War, has gradually revived. The state has opened up new farmlands, rebuilt irrigation systems, and introduced new crops from the New World. In this era of prosperity, the population has burgeoned and flourished."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_30_title:0 "Compulsory Military Service"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_30_desc:0 "War is the continuation of diplomacy, but foolish foreigners only understand the language of violence, making war the sole form of diplomacy they comprehend. Therefore, [Root.GetName] must possess a formidable military. All Lotharingians are obligated to perform military service for [Root.GetName], enabling our homeland to make its voice heard."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_33_title:0 "Legion Command"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_33_desc:0 "The military of [Root.GetName] once relied heavily on vast numbers of vassal armies and noble levies. However, with the progression of the times, to simplify command structures and maximize troop training, we must establish a unified legionary organization, equipped with new weaponry and commanded by Paladins, achieving institutionalization of the armed forces."

EDG_mission_LOT_1_34_title:0 "The New Army"
EDG_mission_LOT_1_34_desc:0 "Technological advancements and the evolution of warfare have given rise to a new military stratum. Beyond the Paladins and the traditional military nobility, the well-to-do youths of good families in [Root.GetName] have formed a new-style army characterized by strict discipline, advanced equipment, and high morale. Highly loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], this force establishes a new balance of power against the old aristocracy, significantly enhancing the authority of the Carolingian monarch as the arbiter and helmsman of military affairs."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_1_title:0 "The Crown's Fissure"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_1_desc:0 "Lotharingia is the last surviving direct descendant of Charlemagne, the sole remnant of the Carolingian dynasty, and the legitimate heir to the Frankish Empire. By right, it should be the leader of the Western world and the Emperor of the Romans. However, the beleaguered Lotharingia of today resembles Noah's Ark amidst turbulent seas, surrounded by the swirling currents of the French and Germans, where a single misstep could lead to utter ruin. We must turn the tide, mend the fissure in the crown, and restore the Franks to glory!"

EDG_mission_LOT_2_2_desc:0 "Since the 13th century, the authority of the Catholic Church has steadily declined amidst successive failures of the Crusades. Concurrently, Lotharingia has endured a prolonged period of decline. We and the Church are not only fellow sufferers but also natural allies. From Pope Gregory X onward, the Papacy has recognized the King of Lotharingia as 'the heir of Charlemagne and Roman Emperor.' Now, we must clarify our stance. We must either continue, like our forebears Pippin and Charlemagne, to be staunch supporters of the Catholic faith and the Pope, or resolve to usurp him and all he represents."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_4_title:0 "Sever the Imperial Roots"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_4_desc:0 "Portions of our territory once belonged to the Holy Roman Empire, but we were never a part of that Germanic entity. On the contrary, the very existence of this German empire is an affront to Lotharingia. From the time of Zwentibold to the present day, the East Francia ruled by 'Child' Louis and the Holy Roman Empire founded by Otto I have been our adversaries, contesting our title of 'Emperor of the Romans.' Centuries of conflict have ingrained a deep-seated, irreconcilable hatred between Lotharingians and Germans. To prevent a recurrence of the 'Chaotic Century,' the lingering poison of the false empire must be eradicated."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_7_title:0 "The Wealth of Flanders"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_7_desc:0 "The economically advanced Low Countries are the jewel of Western Europe, prosperous commercial centers along the Narrow Seas, yet they have long struggled with trade competition against the British. Lotharingia, on the other hand, possesses formidable military might and is the hegemon of Europe, yet lacks the mercantile talent to bring her wealth. Perhaps we can collaborate with them, using Lotharingia's sword to defend the plow of the Netherlands."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_8_title:0 "The Kingdom of Arles"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_8_desc:0 "Due to various reasons, the Albigensian Crusade ended in failure. The victorious Duke of Toulouse had the Cathar anti-pope crown him as the 'King of Arles,' declaring his intent to restore Charlemagne's glory. Perhaps during the kingdom's period of decline, these Gnostic heretics shared a friendship with us. But as Lotharingia steadily revives and ascends to the center of Europe, they appear in the eyes of the royal court as nothing more than pitiable and detestable pretenders. Let us abolish the false Cathar regime of Arles and reestablish the Kingdom of Arles, belonging to the lineage of Lothair."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_10_title:0 "The Bavarian Conflagration"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_10_desc:0 "The conquest of the ancestral lands of East Francia has opened the path to Bavaria for us. This vast territory, once belonging to the Carolingians, is now fragmented by the strife between the Wittelsbach brothers. We must aid in unifying Bavaria, bringing its wealth and wisdom back under our control."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_11_title:0 "The Habsburg Failure"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_11_desc:0 "Originating in Swabia, the House of Habsburg grew powerful through its ties to the Hohenstaufen dynasty, expanding through war and marital alliances to become one of the mightiest princes within the Holy Roman Empire, nearly monopolizing the imperial throne. Yet, under Lotharingia's onslaught, the Habsburgs not only failed to defend the German princes but also lost cities and lands. Their claim to the title of 'Heir of Charlemagne' appears utterly ludicrous in the face of the true Carolingian lineage."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_13_title:0 "King of Romagna"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_13_desc:0 "Romagna is the crucible of the Apennines, the convergence point of rivalries in Northern Italy, and the seat of the former Greek Exarchate of Ravenna on the peninsula.

From Charles 'the Hammer's' victory at the Battle of Tours to the Spanish March established by Charlemagne and his son, these are testaments to the divine might and sacred valor of the Carolingian dynasty. Now, the fortunes of the weak Christian lords in the south grow dim once more, and the blood-soaked conflicts of Iberia may yet see another shift.

During this period, the people of Porto and Galicia, pressured by the military competition of Iberian conflicts, set sail and charted countless new sea routes. As the protector of Iberian Christians, the patron of Catholic monarchs, and the leader of the Reconquista, properly managing the relationship between the Lusitania region and the central authority would greatly benefit the empire's overseas expansion and trade."

EDG_mission_LOT_2_20_title:0 "Church-State Relations"
EDG_mission_LOT_2_20_desc:0 "The symbiotic relationship between the Carolingian dynasty and the Catholic Church dates back to the time of Pippin III. Cooperation with the Church secured the Frankish crown for the Carolingians. The campaigns of Charlemagne and his Twelve Paladins not only won us the Roman imperial throne but also promoted the spread of Catholicism across Western Europe. In today's Europe, with religious chaos and Catholicism in decline, we must strengthen the court's influence over the Church to control the situation and ensure the nation's piety."

First proposed by Pope Gelasius I, it gained prominence during the evangelical campaigns of Charlemagne's mighty armies. This theory holds that God granted the 'sword of spiritual power' and the 'sword of temporal power' to the Pope and the monarch respectively, forming a divinely ordained duality: the Pope confers sanctity upon royal authority through coronation, while the monarch protects the interests of the Church with military force. The temporal sword can sharpen the spiritual sword, and the spiritual sword can temper the temporal sword. Both swords interact and combine, each being a sword of Christ."
