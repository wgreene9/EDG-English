EDG_flavor_IBR_religion_conflict.1.d:0 "While the Christian kings of the north were embroiled in internal strife, with the Marinids putting up stubborn resistance in northern Morocco, the Almohad Caliphate, caught in civil war, saw its influence increasingly confined to the outskirts of Marrakesh. The hereditary governors initially appointed to rule Iberian territories scrambled to declare independence one after another. Once again, hegemony from Africa crumbled to dust in Iberia. Although the governors had once signed a mutual defense pact vowing "eternal peace among themselves," the seeds of discord sprouted with a force no mere document could restrain. Iberia once again entered an era of warring states. In the eyes of later historians, the first half of the 13th and 14th centuries became known as the "Third Taifa Period." Throughout these 150 years, border conflicts between Christians and Muslims never fully ceased. The most significant among them was a grand offensive against Lisbon launched by the King of Portugal and the King of Asturias. However, due to overextension, they were ambushed by Muslims south of Coimbra, and the campaign ultimately came to naught.\n\nAs the Cathar forces steadily consolidated and grew stronger in southern France, and Catholic states grew increasingly weary of the very concept of crusades, the lands south of the Pyrenees gradually evolved into a relatively independent "small world," somewhat detached from the wider Catholic sphere. Although external interference occurred from time to time, it ultimately failed to alter the strategic stalemate between the two sides.\n\nYet, when King Ignacio III of Asturias launched a crusade against Tulaytulah, the flames of the Iberian Struggle were reignited once more."

EDG_IBR_monuments_event.1.d:0 "Galicia is located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, along the Atlantic coast, serving as one of the vital gateways connecting Europe and the Americas. Thus, its port enjoys a superior geographical location, facilitating maritime trade. The 16th century was a period of flourishing European trade, and the port of Galicia prospered accordingly. Major trading partners included goods from Europe, the Americas, and Africa, such as gold and silver, textiles, spices, and slaves. Additionally, significant pirate activity also contributed somewhat to the port's prosperity. In the 16th century, Galicia's port facilities were highly comprehensive, including the famous ports of A Coruña and Vigo. These ports were fully equipped with docks, warehouses, and cranes, meeting the loading and unloading needs of ships and cargo of various types and scales. Due to its advantageous location, active trade, comprehensive port infrastructure, and advancements in navigation technology, the port of Galicia thrived, becoming one of the key hubs for trade between Europe and the Americas. However, the aging port now seems to somewhat hinder the city's development."

He added eight aisles to the east of the mosque, planted extensive orange groves, and constructed four large fountains. In 1523, the prayer hall was rebuilt according to Renaissance principles. The engineers promised that if the final phase proceeded smoothly, the hall's decoration would be the most luxurious in the Caliphal style, featuring meticulously carved floral and leaf patterns around the arches, colorful domes, and unique ornamentation—all of which would be magnificent.
