EDG_TEUEvents.0.desc:0 "As the voices for secularization grow louder, some believe we should fully secularize and establish a new state; while another faction argues that the Order should uphold its sacred mission rather than feudalizing and resting on the status quo.\n\nAfter lengthy deliberations and planning, the Grand Master believes there should be a balance between complete secularization and maintaining the Order's structure. Why can't we have both? Perhaps this is the path the Teutonic Order should choose."

EDG_flavor_teu.42.desc:0 "The Teutonic Order, composed of German nobility, was founded along the Baltic coast with the initial aim of bringing the true faith to the local natives. Although missionary work ended decades ago, we have decided to remain on the lands of the Prussians, making it the home of the Order—though this has somewhat vexed Poland. Over the past forty years, we have fought four wars with Poland, suffering significant military setbacks. The wealthy cities of Prussia, taking advantage of our weakness, are conspiring against our authority. The so-called Prussian Confederation is an imminent threat that must be dealt with swiftly...\n\nHowever, we are not at a dead end, fighting for survival; there is still room for maneuver. The Order stands at a crossroads for the future. The unexpected collapse of the Kingdom of Poland has reduced the pressure we face. If we can completely crush Poland, we may be able to choose a new path."

In this agreement, [From.GetName] declares it will not declare war on members within the Empire and shall wage war against enemies in the name of the Empire and the Lord. Simultaneously, [From.GetName] will enter into a defensive pact with the Emperor, allowing the Emperor to call upon [From.GetName] to join any defensive war he is engaged in.\n\nIn return, the Empire also bears the responsibility to grant them more privileges and resources to strengthen their military capabilities.\n\nIt should be noted that this treaty is strictly personal; therefore, upon the death of [From.GetName]'s ruler, the treaty shall become void."
