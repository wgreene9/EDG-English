mission_EDGTABmission.01.txt:0 "Hey, my dear friend, when Iran is mentioned, what comes to your mind? Come, let me guess - extremely conservative? Rampant terrorist organizations? Or devout Muslims?\nOh, certainly, my dear friend, you must be tired of such narratives by now?\nWell, today's tale, the story I am about to recount, is not about Iran of this time, but rather about a legend that once vigorously composed an epic chapter on the land of Central Asia. Even though that nation has long perished, and even its former faith has been forgotten."

mission_EDGTABmission.02.txt:0 "Persia, known in Aryan language as Iran, meaning 'Land of Light', primarily practiced Zoroastrianism founded by Zarathustra. During the era of Cyrus the Great, the Achaemenid Empire, also known as the First Persian Empire, was established - the first vast empire spanning Asia, Europe, and Africa.\nAfter the fall of the First Persian Empire, Persia entered a period of foreign rule that persisted until a ruler from Persis, Ardashir I, overthrew Parthian rule and founded the Sassanian Empire, also known as the Second Persian Empire.\nDuring the Second Empire, many rulers attempted to restore the prosperous territories of the Achaemenid era, leading to continuous wars with Rome that lasted for years. Unfortunately, both sides not only exhausted their national strength but failed to gain significant advantages from each other. Worse still, one of them was ultimately destroyed by a newly rising power, while the other suffered heavy losses at the hands of that same nation. It seemed these two epic legends had finally reached their conclusion...\nOh, my dear friend, don't be so impatient. This is not a history of a nation's demise, but rather the tale of §Pa purple phoenix belonging to the Iranian plateau rising from its ashes§!. Now, this story is just beginning."

mission_EDGTABmission.333.txt:0 "In 1444, to the east lies a weakened but still ambitious Timurid Empire eyeing Iran; to the south, the Ajam Sultanate watches both the Timurids and us with vigilance; to the west, the great Turkmen tribal confederations of the Black Sheep and White Sheep, divided between Sunni and Shia faiths. If only we could bring the Shia-aligned one to our side... though that seems nearly impossible.\nOh yes, the last remnant of this ancient empire huddles trembling in a corner by the Caspian Sea, never knowing when it might be attacked and destroyed by any major power.\nNow follows the monologue of the current ruler:\n...\nI had a dream, a terribly vivid dream. I dreamed of the earth cracking open, volcanic ash blotting out the sky, and everyone falling freely into hell.\nI dreamed of the world restructuring, of historical turning points shifting differently, until everything had changed!\nI dreamed of a world completely different from our own - where though we remained weak, the surrounding nations weren't impossible for us to defeat one by one. I even saw the sacred fire that once burned...\nI dreamed of a brand new world, where all evil was cleansed, deceased loved ones and friends were resurrected, and no sin or wickedness remained - a world overflowing with happiness.\n...\nAt dawn, as dreams faded, Kamal al-Din sorted through the chaotic thoughts in his mind.\nAs if comprehending something, he simply gazed around his plain, unadorned bedchamber and firmly patted his cheeks:\n'Regardless of whether the dream was real or not, at least I'm here now. At the very least, I must do something.'"

In Iran, Zoroastrian believers still resist. As the legitimate heirs of the Sassanids, how can we surrender? Through our efforts, the people under our rule have remembered their former faith, and Iran's fragmentation has given us breathing room. That elusive flame seems to be growing brighter again. However! Although we now have hope for revival, we cannot shed our disguise as Muslim believers until we possess self-defense capabilities. Currently, the first step towards true revival is to seek assistance from those two nations that have re-established Zoroastrianism as their state religion."

It was as if he awaited someone's arrival. Perhaps the next moment would bring the Ulema surging in with furious intent to take his life. Since becoming ruler, every day had been a dance on knife's edge, making the mere forty-year-old appear like a lonely septuagenarian.\n\"My dear child, how have you been?\" He gently stroked the remaining half of the token once shared with his beloved child, sighing like a solitary old man. Ever since the Ulema began doubting their devotion to Allah, distrust had grown daily. Finally, over a decade ago, shortly after Kamal al-Din assumed power, the Ulema targeted his only capable son: Ardeshir.\n\"Drive this damned heretic who seeks to subvert the true faith from our lands!\" None knew what emotions Kamal al-Din felt when uttering those words, but exile was the only compromise he could secure. The teenage Ardeshir cast a venomous glance at his father, tore the necklace he had worn since childhood—the token symbolizing their bond—keeping half and throwing the other to the ground. Without farewell or companionship, he left Mazandaran alone, never to be heard from again.\nEven now, the Ulema's suspicions remained largely unabated, though Kamal al-Din's ruthless expulsion of Ardeshir and his increasingly covert actions prevented further confrontation.\nThe creak of the opening door and subsequent footsteps made Kamal al-Din tense.\n\"Growing impatient? Seeking to install a new family as Shah? Nothing but parasites!\"\nHe laughed bitterly at his helplessness—what could an unarmed man do?\n\"Your Majesty, you misunderstand. I've come to aid you.\" The voice didn't belong to any familiar Ulema. Kamal al-Din's anxiety eased slightly before he sharply retorted: \"Help? Do you even know my circumstances?\"\nThe shadowed figure smiled faintly: \"The six great nobles and the Ulema—all thorns in your side.\"\n\"I've struggled against them for over a decade without success. How could an unknown stranger confront them?\"\n\"Oh, your Majesty, truth be told, I once served as an official under Shah Rukh.\"\nKamal al-Din pressed: \"So what?

However, our \"Shah's Royal Guard\" remains unaffected by military corruption. This unit serves us as mercenaries and can be hired through the mercenary interface. We must utilize these §Ymercenaries§! wisely.\n\nReligious Dilemma: In present-day Persia, Zoroastrians face persecution. The Mar'ashi family has nominally converted to Shia Islam while secretly adhering to §PZoroastrianism§!, and in 1409 were forced to cede significant power to the Ulema. Now, these §GUlema§! wield overwhelming influence and show clear hostility toward the secretly Zoroastrian Mar'ashi family. Therefore, we must seek opportunities to defeat these Ulema. Remember, any compromise with the Ulema will make their eventual removal more difficult - avoid excessive concessions.\n\nDiplomatic Dilemma: Our nation remains unstable, with many domestic factions withholding loyalty and seeking foreign patronage. As long as our province count remains below 15, §Oopposition factions§! will continue viewing us as a weak state, opposing our rule and inflicting major negative modifiers. Only through §Rexpansion§! can we end this situation.\n\nPlease follow the mission tree closely to avoid potential bugs.\nConverting to §PZoroastrianism§! requires first establishing Eranshahr, then surviving the §YRebellious Sword of Islam§! and §YIranian Fragmentation Crisis§! disasters. Do not attempt religious conversion through any means before then.\n\nDespite these numerous challenges, we must remember one thing: only through facing death can we achieve rebirth. Just as our old rivals could rise like phoenixes from their last breath, we too possess a chance to turn the tide. How we seize this opportunity rests entirely in your hands.\n\nOh, and if you're looking for sacred marriage, might I suggest heading over to CK3 instead."
