SUG_idea_1:0 "Classical Hellenization"
SUG_idea_1_desc:0 "The Greek city-states of the Classical era had a tradition of long-distance colonization, and the later Hellenistic period provided inspiration for handling relations between indigenous peoples and settlers. Today, we shall set sail once more in search of the legendary Elysium."

SUG_idea_2:0 "Greater Greek Ethnic Fusion"
SUG_idea_2_desc:0 "The development of Greek culture is not merely expansion, but also fusion. Our footsteps once covered the entire Mediterranean; now is the time to reclaim the glory of the past."

SUG_idea_3:0 "League of City-States"
SUG_idea_3_desc:0 "The city-state politics of ancient Greece endured perpetually. After centuries of iteration, this decentralized yet cohesive political system can serve our exploration well, eliminating any distinction between homeland and colony for the Greeks."

SUG_idea_4:0 "Roman Revisionists"
SUG_idea_4_desc:0 "The conquests of the Latin Crusaders severely damaged the Roman authority of Byzantium, and Rome's abandonment in our hour of need left the Greeks of the East utterly disillusioned. The invasions by foreign peoples ignited ancient Eastern consciousness, gradually reviving Greek philosophical thought. The decline of Eastern Rome, in turn, proves that the Roman legal succession was but a farce. Why should we bow to that imperial Roman crown? The state of the Greeks naturally deserves to bear the glory of the Greeks."

SUG_idea_5:0 "Maritime Trade Tradition"
SUG_idea_5_desc:0 "The Greeks began trans-Mediterranean trade activities as early as the Classical period. This glorious tradition ensures that the Greek people can maintain a foothold in the realm of commerce in any era."

SUG_idea_6:0 "Reformed Greek Democracy"
SUG_idea_6_desc:0 "We can proudly say that Greece is the birthplace of citizen democracy. The lesson of Socrates' death remains clear: the majority should protect the minority, not enact tyranny of the majority."

SUG_idea_7:0 "The Great Ideal"
SUG_idea_7_desc:0 "To reunite the Aegean Sea is the aspiration of the Greeks. The Eastern Rome of yore has vanished with the wind, but this time, the Greeks will realize their own Great Ideal."

SUG_hellas_government_desc:0 "After the Greek world fell once more to foreign invasions, the Greeks along the coast of Asia Minor abandoned the traditions of the Eastern Empire and embraced the political landscape of the Classical era anew, seeking national independence."

SUG_hellas_fire_navy_desc:0 "'Greek Fire' has long been employed by the Greek navy, and we shall continue to uphold this fine tradition. Furthermore, through cultural exchange with the Turks and Latins, we have successfully overcome the defect of Greek Fire being excessively lethal to our own forces, ingeniously enabling this weapon to aid our naval warfare under the safest conditions."

SUG_hellas_reigning_athen:0 "Greek-Style Democracy"
SUG_hellas_reigning_athen_desc:0 "We are the birthplace of democracy, yet today, those nations in the world that claim to be 'democratic' are merely 'false democracies, true autocracies.' Even the kings of Sparta were more honorable than these hypocrites. The governance of democracy lies in defending the weak, not in the rule of one. The rule of the many is always preferable to the rule of the one."

string_start_hellas:0 "Some say: §Y'Glory belongs to Greece, greatness to Rome.'§! Yet centuries have passed, Rome is no longer great, and Greece lacks glory.\n\nSince the tenth century AD, as the Latin world and Eastern powers gradually rose, the Eastern Empire began its long decline. Though its glory had faded, it was once home to countless Greeks, until the invasion of the Turks. Conquerors from Anatolia invaded the Greek world, much like the Persians who swept in centuries before, but this time, we had no §YThree Hundred.§!\n\nFrom streets to mountain streams, the Eastern Empire fought, yet caught between the Latins and Turks, the outcome could only end in §Rdefeat.§! Vast stretches of the Anatolian coast were ceded to the Turks, while Norman descendants seized the crown of Epirus.\n\nThe Eastern Greeks of Smyrna refused to let their state perish. They fought desperately, vowing to fight until the last Greek fell, but their courage was ultimately betrayed by 'traitors.'\n\nThe Greeks of Smyrna tried to send pleas for aid to their brethren, but they did not know that Smyrna had already become the §G'price'§! of compromise between the 'Greeks' and the invaders. Faced with enemies many times stronger around them, the last Greeks of Smyrna seemed forever unable to see victory; they could only scatter overseas, bidding farewell to their homeland. The Smyrniotes were betrayed by their own kin; the Eastern Empire and their fellow Greeks took no action to support the resistance of the Smyrna Greeks. In Nicaea, in Optimaton, in Epirus, in Himara, in foreign lands, how many Greeks listened at night to sounds from their homeland—vague, familiar yet strange sounds from 'foreign lands.'\n\n§Y'Please do not forget Smyrna; her children are still fighting there, until the very last moment…'§!"

EDG_SUG_mission_1_3_title:0 "The Glory of Salamis" # Restoring the Glory of Salamis
EDG_SUG_mission_1_3_desc:0 "The Athenian navy dealt a crushing blow to the Persian army at the Battle of Salamis, laying the foundation for Greek naval dominance in the Classical era. Millennia later, in the face of ever-changing maritime rivals, the long-dormant Greek navy shall rise once more with renewed vitality."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_4_title:0 "Our Sea"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_4_desc:0 "From the first sprout of life beneath the waves, to the giant beasts of the Stone Age, to humanity's first upright steps, the azure sea has always been the home of the Greeks."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_6_title:0 "Classical Heritage"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_6_desc:0 "Sicily was once the overseas jewel of our Classical era. After a millennium of turmoil and change, we shall cherish it all the more now that it has been regained."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_7_title:0 "Reviving Carthage"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_7_desc:0 "The Phoenicians of Carthage were once our maritime nemesis. Yet after millennia, Greece still stands tall, while the ruins of ancient Carthage are left to the sea breezes. A foe of yesteryear, now a memory of old—the legacy of our old rival shall come to life again in our hands."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_9_title:0 "Beyond the Cape"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_9_desc:0 "The Pillars of Heracles were the western boundary of the Classical Greek world; even Aeneas could not clearly describe what lay beyond the pillars. However, we have learned from Berber merchants of the... semblance that lies beyond those rocks."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_11_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_11_desc:0 "Within Europe, around the Black Sea, the footsteps of the Greeks have covered every known corner on the map, yet never found a lasting foothold. Surrounded by powerful enemies, perhaps our only chance for survival lies in crossing the Pillars of Heracles, seeking a glimmer of hope in the uncharted lands on the map…"

EDG_SUG_mission_1_12_title:0 "Arrival at Elysium"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_12_desc:0 "In the darkest hour of the Eastern Roman Empire, some members of the imperial nobility attempted to flee Constantinople by ship, sailing towards unknown lands in search of the mythical Elysium."

EDG_SUG_mission_1_13_title:0 "New Delian League"
EDG_SUG_mission_1_13_desc:0 "From Elysium to Gibraltar, the entire Atlantic Ocean has now become our inner sea. Just like the Delian League of the Classical era, we shall rise once more to form a commercial alliance centered on trade."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_2_title:0 "The Crown of Epirus"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_2_desc:0 "Epirus, child of the mountains. Whether in the Classical period or under Roman rule, the crown of Epirus always belonged to the Greeks, until the Crusader invasion. The Latins and Normans stripped away the glory of Epirus entirely; this is intolerable."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_3_title:0 "The Second Odyssey"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_3_desc:0 "The expedition of Pyrrhus planted Greek military banners in distant Apennines; the enterprise of Greek merchants planted olives at Gibraltar. We shall once more follow the footsteps of our ancestors, traveling with Aeneas, to once again place the Western Mediterranean under the Greek name."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_6_title:0 "The Window of Dyrrhachium"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_6_desc:0 "The mountains of Albania were once the natural barrier of the Greek world against the Illyrians, yet now they have become the last stronghold of the Illyrian descendants. Whatever plans we have for the Balkans, the position of Albania is of no small significance."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_7_title:0 "Rebuilding Magna Graecia"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_7_desc:0 "The region of Napoli was once also the homeland of the Greeks, until the rise of Rome. But even the long Roman rule could not erase the Greek hues of Southern Italy, and what we must do now is make those hues even more vibrant."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_8_title:0 "Reclaiming Liguria"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_8_desc:0 "The Greeks recognized the crucial commercial value of the Liguria region long ago. However, limited by the distance from the homeland, the Greek city-states in Liguria were among the first to fall. But this time, things will change."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_9_title:0 "Gateway to the Mediterranean"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_9_desc:0 "The stone pillars on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar mark the edge of the Classical world and the farthest point the Greeks have ever reached to this day. If we wish to explore unknown seas, we must inevitably extend our former domain to Gibraltar."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_12_title:0 "Establishing New Sparta"
EDG_SUG_mission_2_12_desc:0 "When the children of the Peloponnese crossed the ocean carrying spears and shields to the New World, they promptly named the land beneath their feet Spartania. This will be their new home, a fresh start, filled with blood and laurels."

EDG_SUG_mission_2_13_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the glory and martial prowess pursued by the Spartans ultimately gave rise to the Peloponnesian League. Today, we shall join with Spartania to establish a new, transcontinental and transoceanic league."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_1_title:0 "The Sorrow of Ephesus"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_1_desc:0 "Like the ancient city of Ephesus, the Greek world shattered under the invasion of foreign peoples. Farewell, wandering, homesickness… countless Greeks were swept along by the times, scattered to the four winds. The villages are no longer bustling, the wheat fields no longer gleam. But even if we have but one last shred of hope, even at the cost of utter ruin, we are willing to board our ships. To shout with the waves: Long live, long live, long live the free Greeks!"

EDG_SUG_mission_3_2_title:0 "The Persian Road"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_2_desc:0 "The full-scale invasion of the Greek world by the Achaemenid Empire made us aware of the threat from the East for the first time. Ironically, however, the very route once taken by the Persians can now aid us in returning to our western ancestral lands."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_3_title:0 "Reclaiming Athens"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_3_desc:0 "Millennium after millennium, Athens still stands. Rome's glory long overshadowed the city of Athena, yet she gradually declined under the erosion of time. Today, this city has returned to Greek hands once more, and she shall again remember the glory of old."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_4_title:0 "War of Fate"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_4_desc:0 "The Turks are at the gates. In Thrace, in Optimaton, in Thessaloniki, in Nicaea… usurping invaders seek to rule Greece, much like the Persians centuries ago. So be it, let them come!"

EDG_SUG_mission_3_5_title:0 "Greek Restoration"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_5_desc:0 "Centuries, days and months, springs and summers… decade after decade, century after century, the Greeks scattered everywhere have today, on this commemorative day, reclaimed their homeland once more. Long live Greece, long live the glory of the Aegean Sea!"

EDG_SUG_mission_3_9_title:0 "The Giant's Footsteps"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_9_desc:0 "The first Roman foothold in Iberia was Catalonia. The former giant of the Mediterranean used this as a base to monopolize much of the Western Mediterranean trade, and we shall emulate this, recreating the image of Magna Graecia."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_10_title:0 "Helmsman Guides the Voyage" # The Helmsman Guides the Mediterranean Voyage
EDG_SUG_mission_3_10_desc:0 "The helmsman guides the Mediterranean voyage; maritime trade relies on the Greeks. From Athens to Smyrna, from Gibraltar to Cyprus, every shipping lane bears the presence of Greek vessels. This is our era, a glorious and prosperous era."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_11_title:0 "The Great Ideal"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_11_desc:0 "When did Greece fall? I cannot recall; it has been too long. When we were scattered across the lands, we raised our eyes but saw no homeland, day after day, year after year. When we returned to our homeland, we were trapped, surrounded by powerful nations, swallowing our pride, bowing our heads without dignity. But my descendants, and their descendants, through countless days and nights of effort, have achieved the final victory. The vision of Serios is no longer a dream; the dreams of countless Serioses have finally been realized. Glory belongs to Greece once more; the Great Ideal is finally fulfilled!"

EDG_SUG_mission_3_12_title:0 "New Home for a King of Kings" # A New Home for the King of Kings
EDG_SUG_mission_3_12_desc:0 "The descendants of the Persians from Ardabil, fleeing disaster, found themselves by chance in a mysterious land to the west. These Persian descendants, having journeyed a thousand miles in exile, are skilled merchants. Supporting their endeavors can benefit our intercontinental trade and promote the fusion of Persian and Greek cultures."

EDG_SUG_mission_3_14_title:0 "The Greek World"
EDG_SUG_mission_3_14_desc:0 "From sea to sea, from river to river, the footsteps of the Greeks have traversed the entire world. Just as the Greeks of the Classical era traversed the Mediterranean, we shall set forth once more if needed, to journey across the entire world."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_2_title:0 "Guarding Ionia"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_2_desc:0 "The Ionia region is the eastern gateway of the Greek world, and now it lies immobilized under the gaze of Turks and Latins. Restoring Greek control over the area is of great significance for consolidating our borders; we must not let the Turks seize the initiative."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_3_title:0 "Eastern Strategy"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_3_desc:0 "The threat from the Eastern Turks is certainly important, but as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy could be a friend. Blind hatred and hostility, given our encirclement by powerful foes, would only cost us potential allies. Therefore, we must reconsider our strategic approach in Anatolia."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_6_title:0 "Sunset in Anatolia"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_6_desc:0 "For a long period under Roman rule, the Greeks held absolute control over Anatolia. However, with the empire's decline, Greece could no longer penetrate this land that was once our own. The desire to restore past glory does not mean we will act solely on impulse; Greece needs wisdom, not blind territorial expansion."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_7_title:0 "The Dark Sea"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_7_desc:0 "Greek ancestors visited and settled in Crimea thousands of years ago. Even though subsequent centuries of conflict distanced this land from Greece, the influence of our culture remains. Rather than leaving it to drift, appropriate intervention is clearly the wiser choice."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_10_title:0 "Navigating Africa"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_10_desc:0 "Sailing southward along the coast of North Africa, months of voyaging outline the full shape of the quest. Great adventure, apart from glory itself, naturally offers immensely valuable rewards—trade."

EDG_SUG_mission_4_11_title:0 "Monopolizing Eastern Trade"
EDG_SUG_mission_4_11_desc:0 "We once thought the Persians were the East, until Alexander reached India. We then thought India was the East, until Greek merchant ships arrived in Nusantara. From the Malay world to the Greek world, passing through the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, we have monopolized the entire African coast, turning the Atlantic into a veritable inner sea."

EDG_SUG_mission_5_3_title:0 "Returning to Thermopylae"
EDG_SUG_mission_5_3_desc:0 "Stranger, tell the Spartans that we who lie here faithfully carried out their orders. The warriors fought for Greece in life, and they continue to fight for Greece in death."

EDG_SUG_mission_5_4_title:0 "From Sea to Land"
EDG_SUG_mission_5_4_desc:0 "The Greek navy is invincible, but the main event of war always occurs on land. Having achieved absolute naval supremacy, it is time for us to consider shifting some focus to pave the way for the army's advance."

EDG_SUG_mission_5_6_title:0 "The Tranquil Island"
EDG_SUG_mission_5_6_desc:0 "As one of the homelands of the Greeks, Cyprus presents a complex situation. As the junction between East and West, Greek, Turkic, Persian, Arab, and Egyptian cultures converge and intermingle here, which inevitably means this island cannot remain forever silent."

EDG_SUG_mission_5_7_desc:0 "The Great Library of Alexandria is filled with the wisdom of the Greeks; the Lighthouse illuminates the path for the Greeks. The pharaohs who ruled Upper and Lower Egypt are no more, leaving only Greek chroniclers to tell the stories of these ancient kings."

Under the pure white firmament, the tranquil Aegean Sea churns with blue waves, and the splendor of the Greeks seemed everlasting, but no feast in this world lasts forever.\n\n'Rome has fallen! Greece has fallen!'\n\nThe people rushed about in panic.\n\nThe invasion of the Turks shattered the Empire, and Serios was born in this era. The glory of Rome was long gone, and with it was buried the laurels of Greece. This little boy from Smyrna dreamed that one day, he too could become a great hero like Odysseus or Heracles, placing the crown of glory once more upon Greece's head.\n\n'Why, why have they abandoned us?!'\n\nThe people wept in despair.\n\nWhen the nation lay dying under the assaults of the Latins, Serios and his companions risked countless dangers to seek aid in Constantinople, only to receive in return a treaty with the enemy. Smyrna was abandoned, the city becoming a compromise between the Latins and the Turks. As the proud Turks approached the city with their army, the Greeks of Smyrna, young and old alike, took up arms in a desperate resistance, barely preserving the last spark of Greek presence in the East amidst the hopeless invasion.\n\nThough not all Greek states had perished, with Morea and Byzantium still clinging to a thread of life, for the Greeks of Smyrna, they could rely only on themselves..."

Yet, ironically, centuries later, the Greek navy now finds itself able to sail only by the grace of the Latins.\n\nThe greedy and foolish Venetian merchants constantly seek to strangle us; Latin ships sail freely in the Aegean, mocking the Greek fleet harbored in port. The Venetian merchants must pay for their actions. When they chose to sell out the Eastern Empire for gold, their fate was sealed.\n\nThough hatred can give us strength, blind hatred is undoubtedly foolish. Today, Venetian merchants control nearly half of the Eastern Mediterranean trade. While antagonizing them could bring us short-term economic gains, we might lose a potential ally. Of course, we could also choose to set aside past grievances for now; economic cooperation with the Venetians would clearly allow us to better utilize mercenaries from Northern Italy.\n\nIn any case, the new Greek navy of this era is still too weak, leaving us with few real choices.

Despite occasional conflicts, Albanians have integrated extensively into our society.\n\nDuring the rule of the Eastern Empire, Greek ethnicity still held some influence in the Balkans. But now the Eastern Empire is but a memory, and our former homeland has been ceded to Bulgarians and Serbs.\n\nAfter regaining some strength, we could certainly attempt to reclaim our ancestors' lands, joining with our Albanian brethren to drive the Slavs out of the Eastern Balkans once more. While this would expand our terrestrial domain, would it be wise for a Greece focused on maritime trade and naval power?\n\nFor many Greeks, the era of the Eastern Empire is gone forever. The Balkans today are caught between the Turks, Latins, false Romans, and Magyars. Premature advance into the region would only bring us unnecessary trouble.

The palace walls were inlaid with gold, splendid and magnificent.'\n\nAncient Atlantis, in Plato's writings, sank, destroyed by floods, forever submerged beneath the sea. Yet these millennia of sediment have not completely erased the memory of this distant kingdom; instead, countless Greeks have ventured forth in succession, attempting to find it.\n\nOther nations consider this nonsense, a predetermined futility. However, as the Greek world fractured under foreign invasions, the Greeks of Smyrna had no choice but to gamble everything.\n\n'If the homeland falls completely, then at least they have a final glimmer of hope… in Atlantis.'\n\nMillennia of effort were no jest. A Byzantine navigator named Konstantinos, after several overseas expeditions, actually found some clues in the distant, lonely ocean. Though European powers scoffed at the news, we had no other choice.\n\nThe final fleet of Smyrna, led by Konstantinos, sailed westward, passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, and then northward.

Some Byzantine nobles chose to abandon the journey midway, seeking refuge in Ireland, while the remaining Eastern Romans chose to continue with the fleet on this path of no return.\n\nFreshwater dwindled, ships began to break, and even food ran low. Yet perhaps through sheer piety and a stroke of luck, when the cross hanging around Konstantinos's neck caught the sunlight, its reflection pierced through layers of sea fog, pointing towards another island ahead.\n\nAfter sailing for an unknowable length of time, the battered and depleted Smyrna fleet finally arrived, under divine guidance, at the endpoint of Konstantinos's previous voyage: 'Megara.'"

The Albanians, while also favoring a southern course, insisted they must settle at the next island they found, not continue searching for the so-called Atlantis.

Where was this? No one knew. It seemed to flow with honey and milk, a promised land for the Greeks.\n\nThe soil was fertile and soft. Cargo was unloaded, ships dismantled, and a small settlement arose on this unknown new continent. This was not Atlantis, but a new world never before recorded.\n\nThe Persians from the Safavid Empire named it 'Persia Minor' (Po-si), hoping to recreate the image of their homeland upon this land. As the coastal settlement neared completion, our community received some visitors. This new continent was not uninhabited; it had many indigenous peoples.

Muddy swamps made construction difficult, while towering redwood trees obstructed the pioneers' advance.\n\nThe Persian remnants chose to name this land after the redwoods, blending the Safavid banner with Greek styles to govern this land through a fusion of both cultures. Initially, these Persians more or less retained their own cultural customs. However, as settled life continued, intermingling with the Greeks and local 'Atlanteans' gradually altered the culture of the Iranian plateau.\n\nThe Persians living in the city-state of Persia Minor (Po-si), though still considering themselves Persian, now spoke fluent Greek, while their original Persian language gradually faded into loanwords.\n\nThey may have initially harbored dreams of restoring their homeland, but the passage of time and cultural blending eventually made them almost forget their native soil, finally uttering those words:"
