Upon reviving Sassanid Persia, it is our duty to rebuild this great academy... No, not merely rebuild. We must learn from the House of Wisdom's greater success, understand how it supplanted the original status of the Gundeshapur Academy, and reform our academic exchange practices accordingly. This will solidify the position of the Gundeshapur Academy, transforming it into the world's academic center."

However, to prevent a recurrence of the situation where bureaucratic power surpasses that of the Shahanshah (King of Kings), we should re-establish the position of the Grand Frahmadar (Vuzurg Framadar) from the Sassanian era.

We must continue to advance and glorify Persian architecture."

Furthermore, because this tactic demands extreme marching speed and soldier stamina is limited, it cannot sustain prolonged high-intensity combat. Therefore, if the capital of a major power we are fighting is not captured during the execution of this tactic, we must be prepared for a protracted war of attrition."

Old rival, even though you are long gone, before the war begins, I, ah, still have a few words I wish to say to you:\nAfter fighting for so many years, who could have imagined that both of us ultimately lost to a nation that had barely risen? Thinking back on it now, it's rather laughable—I was once annihilated, yet I was reborn after my demise. You... hovered on the brink of resurgence and collapse, lingering on in a feeble state for so long.\nAnd now, at last, I have returned, reborn from the ashes, retracing the path to meet you once more. What stands before me is no longer the city once called Constantinople...\nIt's a pity that our duel can never reach its conclusion... Since your fall, aside from that Frank and his descendant, the Holy Roman Empire, one state after another has claimed your title. Yet, none have endured as long as you did—ah, especially that Frank. That upstart actually managed to defeat the Caliphate that had once vanquished us, only to fragment himself over succession issues. Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous. Tell me, if our strife had not persisted so long, if at least after the Caliph's invasion, we had united, settling accounts only after repelling him, then perhaps we... But alas, time grants no 'what ifs';\n......\nWhy do I speak thus of my rival? Out of pity for an opponent? Ah, it is not pity, but neither is it mockery. Though I long to shed tears for you, I cannot. We both once stood majestic at the world's summit. Even if that battle can never be concluded, at least, let me personally bring 'you' to an end—war is the flower offered to you; the blood shed by both sides is the wine poured in your honor. Old rival... rest in peace. Our story must draw to a close, even if these words come from the mouth of your enemy!"

The family, dressed in finery, gathers around the Haft-Seen table, recites verses from the Avesta, and contemplates divine grace. The leaping sacred fire is solemnly lit or tended—it is the eternal symbol of light and truth. Relatives exchange blessings and gifts, sharing a lavish festival feast where fresh fish and colored eggs are essential, symbolizing abundance and the revival of life.

People picnic, sing, and dance, gently tossing the carefully nurtured wheat sprouts into flowing water, symbolizing the merging of personal rebirth wishes and blessings into the great cycle of nature. Thus, Nowruz concludes perfectly in the harmonious dance between humanity and nature and in pious prayers for a bright future.\nNowruz, this millennia-spanning sacred spring covenant, renews year after year the eternal Zoroastrian faith in cosmic renewal and the purity of life, woven between the light of fire, the vitality of green, and the spirituality of mountains and rivers."

He is an advocate in judgment: the Saoshyant, along with deities like Mithra and Anahita, presides over the judgment, ensuring believers receive a fair verdict.\nHe aids souls crossing the bridge: helping the devout safely cross the Chinvat Bridge (Bridge of Judgment) into the realm of light.\nHe grants eternal life: believers gain immortal bodies in the new world, eternally enjoying the supreme order (Asha) of Ahura Mazda.\nHe overcomes fear: utterly destroying the evil spirit Druj, freeing believers forever from evil's harassment.\nHe is a beacon of faith: the belief in the Saoshyant's coming itself provides protection in the present world.\nHe instills hope: believers persevere in good deeds amidst present suffering, knowing ultimate victory is certain; strengthens morality: to pass the final judgment, believers more actively practice "Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta" (good thoughts, good words, good deeds); unites the community: shared anticipation of the savior strengthens the religious community."

He combats the demon of pollution: Tishtrya cleanses water sources of poisons (like the "lizard venom" cast by the drought demon), protecting water purity.\nHe purifies rivers: ensuring the safety of drinking and irrigation water, preventing disease; guards sacred waters: works in concert with the goddess Anahita to maintain the sanctity of water bodies. His stellar divinity is associated with Sirius (its rising in summer heralds the Nile flood, symbolizing the rainy season in Persia).\nHe provides divination guidance: observing Sirius's position aids agricultural planning (like sowing times).\nHe disperses night demons: the star's light deters evil spirits in the dark (like the thief demon Bushyansta), protecting night travelers."

'Now we should set aside past prejudices and unite, for we share the identity of Roman successors.' 'Those Persians have done some good; their constructions have provided us with many supplies.'' Another official reported even worse news.\nThe Shahanshah merely closed his eyes, listening to the reports.\n'Shahanshah, shouldn't we send troops to suppress these dissidents?' 'They have already managed to turn almost all the governors in territories once ruled by Rome. If we let this continue, I fear we...'\n'Will face a Rome at its peak, correct?' After listening for a long time, the Shahanshah finally spoke his first words, and the officials below fell silent. 'However, merely suppressing the rebellion won't achieve a good result. Let them form a coalition against us, and then we suppress it. Only then can those discordant voices be completely silenced.'\nMost officials understood the Shahanshah's surface meaning and stopped reporting on the rebellion, turning instead to daily trivial matters.\nOf course, a few discerning individuals understood that this was not just to consolidate rule, but also to overcome a deep-seated psychological burden, to finally bring closure to that war which had never truly ended. 'By Mazda, ancestors, please bless us. In this war of enmity, we shall ultimately achieve victory.'"

mission_EDGERSmission.237.txt:0 "Zoroastrianism (also called Mazdayasna) was the state religion of the ancient Persian Empire, founded by the prophet Zoroaster around 1500-1200 BCE. It is one of the world's earliest systematic monotheistic religions. Zoroastrianism worships the benevolent god Ahura Mazda ('Lord of Wisdom'), representing light and truth (Asha), opposing the evil spirit Angra Mainyu ('Destructive Spirit'), representing darkness and falsehood (Druj). It was once the most influential religion in the Iranian region, with followers aiding the good god in overcoming evil through good thoughts, good words, and good deeds (Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta).\nAfter the Islamic conquest, Zoroastrianism's status was gradually replaced by Islam. Countless fire temples were demolished and rebuilt as mosques, and Iranian Zoroastrians gradually converted to Islam during this period—this was the darkest hour for Zoroastrianism. The sacred fire that once illuminated all corners of Iran was on the verge of extinction; a mere breath could extinguish its weak flame. At that time, everyone believed Zoroastrianism had no hope left.\nBut now, the situation has reversed. The Avesta is once again spreading across this land; mosques are being converted back into fire temples. The ancient faith is propagating once more on this soil. All of this proclaims to the world: The sacred fire has been rekindled; truth and light once again shine upon the land of Iran."

# HOLY_SITE_446_DESC:0 "古伊朗的至高神和智慧之神，被尊为“包含万物的宇宙”。\n公元前600年前后，琐罗亚斯德（Zoroaster）发起宗教改革，将阿胡拉·马兹达奉为“真正的造物主”。琐罗亚斯德宣扬，是阿胡拉·马兹达使人们看到了光明，所以他常常被塑造成太阳的形象。然而太阳和月亮有时会被形容成他的双眼。\n琐罗亚斯德教（Zoroastrianism）认为火具有净化万物的特性，阿胡拉·马兹达可以用火来分辨善恶并将真理之火赐给信众。"
