###ideas
OCC_idea_1:0 "Generations of Farmers"
OCC_idea_1_desc:0 "As early as Roman times, the seven southern provinces of Gaul were important agricultural regions. Though the land was not fertile, farmers still nourished countless people with their blood and sweat. No matter who ruled here, the south would always dedicate everything wholeheartedly - devoting their lives to barren soil while asking for nothing in return."

OCC_idea_2:0 "Pastoral Idyll"
OCC_idea_2_desc:0 "The impoverished southerners care not for gold or luxury, seeking only a simple life. Wives, children, and neighbors are their entire world. The farmers desire no more - as long as the soil remains arable, their unchanging lives will continue unchanged. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow shall all remain the same."

OCC_idea_3:0 "Land of Oc"
OCC_idea_3_desc:0 "In the eyes of Parisians, southern French are crude and barbaric. Provence, Auvergne, Limousin, Guyenne, Gascony, Aquitaine - we speak our own language and celebrate our own New Year traditions. We are the 'coarse southerners', we are Occitanians, and beneath our feet lies the land of Oc - not that of the French."

OCC_idea_4:0 "Preserving the Ancient Tongue"
OCC_idea_4_desc:0 "We are not 'Frenchmen', at least not in language and customs. In villages and farmlands, people communicate in Occitan. Even in mountain streams, minority voices can still be understood through Occitan. Compared to the so-called 'mainstream' French of Paris, Occitan is neither romantic nor convenient - yet it remains the language of our ancestors through generations, and indeed our very lives."

OCC_idea_5:0 "Voice of Justice"
OCC_idea_5_desc:0 "How 'valiant' are the Frankish knights! How 'mighty' are the northern nobles! Behind their conquering footsteps lie millions of peasant families exhausting themselves to provide food, while these nobles claim righteousness - ignoring the impoverished while hypocritically extending their 'helping hands'. What then is true justice?"

OCC_idea_6:0 "Faith of the Ancestors"
OCC_idea_6_desc:0 "Catholicism, Catharism, Islam, even the ancient Euskaran ways in the mountains - our ancestors' blended faiths built the southern provinces. We tolerate differences as soil tolerates stones. The friction of rocks does not damage fields, but makes crops grow stronger."

OCC_idea_7:0 "Shelter for All"
OCC_idea_7_desc:0 "Years of war left fields abandoned and lands depopulated. When empires rose, southern farmers were conscripted with none left to till the soil; when empires fell, southern farmers were slaughtered as peace vanished forever. An old farmer seeks only a home of his own, a shelter from the storm. If northerners cannot hear his voice, who then will listen?"

GUY_idea_1:0 "Fight with Our Backs to the Wall"
GUY_idea_1_desc:0 "The Occitans of Aquitaine are an unfortunate people. The barren southern lands cannot feed enough children, and war has ravaged them endlessly. From Muslims to Christians, from the English to the French, conflict has always loomed over Aquitaine—this land has never known peace."

GUY_idea_2:0 "The 'Court of Love' Without Love"
GUY_idea_2_desc:0 "Eleanor, Countess of Poitiers, is one of the symbols of Aquitaine. Yet her fate was fraught with twists and turns—a loveless countess, much like her domain: an unlucky, forsaken land. The Occitan peasants toil in the fields, as they always have."

GUY_idea_3:0 "The Restless Hound"
GUY_idea_3_desc:0 "It has been long since Aquitaine was conquered by the northern kings. Even as religious strife allowed the southern provinces to break away in practice, the north still sees the south as its 'back garden.' Yet they do not realize—even a tamed hound retains a trace of wildness."

GUY_idea_4:0 "The Last Occitans"
GUY_idea_4_desc:0 "Though Occitan culture remains the soul of the south, her body is frail with age. Since the Parisian conquest, the north's ruthless exploitation and oppression have nearly eradicated Occitan identity. Yet while the Occitans still draw breath, the fight against assimilation shall never cease!"

GUY_idea_5:0 "Might Does Not Make Right"
GUY_idea_5_desc:0 "If 'might makes right,' then centuries of Occitan resistance would be meaningless. From the fields of Landes to the streams of Dordogne, the Occitan tongue carries the voice of defiance."

GUY_idea_6:0 "Legacy of the Occitan Tongue"
GUY_idea_6_desc:0 "To outsiders, Occitan is merely a southern dialect of French—a foolish misconception. The southern language stands on its own; though it shares roots with northern French, this very fact helps us evade the prying eyes of the north."

GUY_idea_7:0 "The Occitanian Dream"
GUY_idea_7_desc:0 "The Occitans of the south speak their own tongue, yet they have no nation of their own. For ages, the southern provinces have been torn apart in the conflicts between the Franks, Iberians, and Italians. But if all Occitans stand united, we can achieve deeds greater than even the Gauls."

The sun's radiance remains eternal, as does the poverty of the South. Compared to the fertile lands of the North, southern villages appear so small and wretched.\n\nRomans, Celts, Angles, Franks - countless nations have ruled over this Occitan land, while our identity has constantly changed. Since ancient times, no southerner could proudly praise their own nation. Though we possess our own language, we have never had our own country.\n\nThe southerners are hardworking, yet this diligence has only brought poverty and backwardness. Now the King of Paris has issued his decree - he will conquer the South and make all 'southern bumpkins' pay taxes. We peasants are honest and law-abiding, we seek neither gold nor glory, yet the northerners plunder our wealth, steal our children, eating the grain we grow while mocking us as uncultured and uneducated.\n\nYoked beneath our 'betters', bearing both the resentment of contempt and stubborn pride, southerners have lived humbly and poorly, century after century. We too have sacrificed our grain and children for 'Frankish glory' and 'defense of the faith', yet those Occitan-speaking men never returned home.\n\nAs sunlight once again falls upon the southern provinces, old farmer Charles looks up from his fields.

In Gascony, in Landes, in Bordeaux, a culture passed down for thousands of years is losing itself. The Occitans live humbly, but their diligence and sweat cannot earn them dignity, for they are seen as 'bumpkins' in northern eyes.\n\nThe prosperity of the North is an unattainable dream for the South. Yet whenever northerners finish eating grain produced in the South, they put down their bowls and curse southerners as being nothing but 'uncultured, immoral' peasants. They plunder southern resources and talent while spurning southern poverty, never realizing it is their own arrogance that ultimately caused the South's rebellion.\n\nIn the chaos of the Albigensian Crusade, Aquitaine was fortunate: when royal and ecclesiastical powers tore the land apart, tiny Aquitaine somehow maintained its status as an independent duchy. Yet Aquitaine is also unfortunate: Arles eyes it covetously, while the French king yearns to unify all of France. The spark of Occitan independence could be snuffed out at any moment.\n\nFor Aquitaine's Occitans, life is bitter. They long to win dignity for themselves and defend their ancestral tongue. When Paris sounds the horn of attack, Aquitaine's life enters its countdown - pitiful and helpless.\n\nTo outsiders, tiny Aquitaine stands no chance against France's steel cavalry nor against the Cathar leaders of the South. They believe the French will conquer Aquitaine as easily as entering their own backyard, and that the weak Occitans likely couldn't even last one hour and twenty-two minutes against the French king's assault."

Now Aquitaine rules the Basques of northern Navarre, these indigenous people becoming a minority within the already-minority Occitan population.\n\nWhile Aquitaine remained constrained by Paris, Basques and Occitans alike suffered northern discrimination. Now that Occitans have gained temporary freedom, the Basques remain imprisoned in their Iberian cage.\n\nIn Paris, revelry never ceases. The lofty French king sees Frankish unification as the supreme glory of the fleur-de-lis, yet turns a deaf ear to minority rights. We minorities seek only autonomy, yet His Majesty even curses our native tongues. Whether Occitan or Basque, we remain lesser beings in Frankish courts.\n\n"Might makes right!"\n\nSo declares the realm of the fleur-de-lis.\n\nWe live in bitter times.

Their hesitation is not unfounded - impoverished Aquitaine cannot possibly defeat either Francia or Arles alone.

The sun's brilliance remains unchanged, much like the enduring poverty of the South. Compared to the fertile lands of the North, the villages of the South appear so small and humble.\n\nRomans, Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Franks—countless nations have ruled this Occitan land, and our identity has constantly shifted. Since ancient times, no Southerner has been able to proudly praise their own nation. Even though we have our own language, we have never had our own state.\n\nThe Southerners are hardworking, but this diligence has only brought poverty and backwardness. The King of Paris has issued his commands: he will conquer the South and make all 'southern bumpkins' pay taxes. We farmers are honest and law-abiding; we do not seek gold, silver, or glory. Yet the Northerners plunder our wealth, seize our children, mock Southerners as uncultured and lowly, all while eating the grain we toil to produce.\n\nYoked beneath the 'superior,' harboring the resentment and pride of the despised, Southerners live humbly and in poverty, century after century. We too have contributed our grain and children for the 'glory of France' and the 'defense of the faith,' but those brave men who spoke Occitan never returned home.\n\nAs the sun once again shines upon the lands of the Southern Provinces, the old farmer Charles looks up from his field.

Under the grinding forces of the fasces and faith, Occitan culture in the South has gradually withered.\n\nIn the fields, in the countryside, in the streets and alleys, the sound of Occitan is being steadily replaced by French. In Gascony, in the Landes, in Bordeaux, a culture passed down for thousands of years is losing itself. The Occitans live humbly, yet their sweat and toil cannot earn them dignity, for they are seen as 'bumpkins' in the eyes of the Northerners.\n\nThe prosperity of the North is a distant dream for the South. Yet, after every meal made from Southern grain, Northerners set down their bowls and proceed to curse Southerners as nothing but 'uncultured, immoral' peasants. They plunder the South's resources and talent while sneering at its poverty, oblivious that it is their own arrogance that has ultimately driven the South to rebellion.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the Cathar Crusades, Aquitaine was fortunate: while royal and papal powers tore the land asunder, little Aquitaine managed to preserve its status as an independent duchy. Yet Aquitaine is also unfortunate: Arles eyes it covetously, while the French king yearns to unify all of Francia. The flame of Occitan independence could be snuffed out at any moment.\n\nFor the Occitans of Aquitaine, life is bitter. They yearn to earn dignity for themselves and to defend the language of their ancestors. When the Parisians sound the call to arms, Aquitaine's life enters a countdown—pitiful and helpless.\n\nTo outsiders, little Aquitaine is utterly incapable of resisting the iron steeds of France or defeating the Southern leader of the Cathars. They believe the French conquest of Aquitaine will be as simple as entering their own backyard, and that the feeble Occitans would likely not withstand the French king's assault for even one hour and twenty-two minutes."

Now, Aquitaine rules the Basques of northern Navarre—these indigenous people are an even smaller minority within the already-minority Occitan community.\n\nWhen Aquitaine was still shackled by Paris, both Basques and Occitans shared the status of targets for Northern discrimination. Now, the Occitans have gained a moment of freedom, but the Basques remain trapped in the Iberian cage.\n\nParis is steeped in revelry day and night; the lofty French king sees the unification of France as the supreme glory of the fleur-de-lis, yet he turns a deaf ear to the interests of minorities. We minorities only seek autonomy, but His Majesty even derides our ethnic languages. Whether Occitan or Basque, we are forever deemed inferiors in the court of France.\n\n"Might makes right!"\n\nSo declares the land of the fleur-de-lis.\n\nWe live in a bitter age.

Centuries of bondage have tormented the land of Gascony, yet her spirit remains unbroken.\n\nAmidst the conflict between Arles and France, Aquitaine has fortuitously gained its independence. However, with the rise of the Cathars and the momentum of French unification, the attention of the two great powers will soon refocus on little Aquitaine. Facing knights adorned with the fleur-de-lis and believers brandishing the cross, fear and uncertainty shake the fragile duchy.\n\n"This is a war destined to be lost..."\n\nSo say the "Pro-French Faction." Their wavering is not without reason; Aquitaine, lacking both funds and provisions, cannot hope to defeat either France or Arles on its own. Rather than face a humiliating downfall, it would be better to lay down arms and submit to the Northerners.\n\nMeanwhile, the "Pro-Arles Faction," similar to their pro-French counterparts, believes that if Aquitaine must attach itself to a greater power, the fellow Occitan state of Arles is surely preferable to the foolish and arrogant France.

The Duke of Aquitaine certainly understands that, despite the phrase "Franco-Occitan Amity" written on the parchment, the essence is the surrender of Aquitaine to France, with the duke himself becoming our spokesperson in the South.\n\nThe "Franco-Occitan Amity" treaty explicitly emphasizes three points:\n\n"First: The Occitans of Aquitaine shall enjoy a degree of autonomy."\n"Second: France is obligated to provide protection to Aquitaine."\n"Third: Aquitaine must establish French as its primary language."\n\nFor the Occitans of Gascony, the first two points are relatively acceptable, but the third is difficult to tolerate. We could directly integrate Aquitaine into the feudal system, or even reduce its autonomy, using the pretext of "protecting French citizens in Bordeaux" to demand that Aquitaine cede its capital, Bordeaux, to us as a "buffer zone for Franco-Occitan amity."\n\nHowever, for every advantage, there is a drawback. Directly making Aquitaine a Appanage would also provoke hostility from neighboring states, making our diplomatic efforts more challenging. Nevertheless, the fate of the South now lies in our hands.

This means Aquitaine must voluntarily relinquish its autonomy and become a vassal state of Arles to maintain friendly relations between the two nations.\n\nAlthough Gascony and Languedoc are brethren, such an action is rather radical and may even exacerbate divisions among the Occitan brothers. We must choose between acceptance and refusal. However, the only silver lining is that, for the sake of brotherhood, even if we reject Arles's vassalage proposal, they will not interfere in our internal affairs.\n\nOf course, refusal also means a rupture between brothers—we will henceforth never receive any aid from Arles…"

In the countryside of Arles, some might praise Aquitaine's courage and fearlessness, but for us, an Aquitaine that heeds no one is of no benefit.\n\nFor the sake of past brotherhood, we will not use this as a pretext for trouble.

# EDG_GUY_mission_from_shadow_title:0 "§JFrom the Shadows§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_from_shadow_desc:0 "How splendid is the court of Arles! The heights our brother nation can achieve are truly awe-inspiring. Yet that is still not our future; at this moment, Aquitaine can only cautiously observe the glory of Arles from the shadows."

# EDG_GUY_mission_stand_arle_title:0 "§JToil by the Lakes§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_stand_arle_desc:0 "Rather than endure Northern oppression, we prefer to yield to the robes of our brethren. How brilliant is the crown of Arles, how glorious their victories—so much so that the king believes Gascony's poverty is unworthy of this splendor."

# EDG_GUY_mission_oc_home_title:0 "§YThe Homeland of the Occitans§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_oc_home_desc:0 "Languedoc—the true land of the Occitans. From ancient times to the present, it has never changed. Only when Gascony and Languedoc unite can the Occitans secure a future."

# EDG_GUY_mission_proud_to_be_title:0 "Proud to Be Corsican"
# EDG_GUY_mission_proud_to_be_desc:0 "The Corsicans, at the intersection of Italian and Occitan cultural spheres, have mixed heritage that makes their belonging hard to define. But now, they can proudly tell the world: I am Corsican, and I am proud of an independent Corsica!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_britannie_free_title:0 "The Hound Turns Wild"
# EDG_GUY_mission_britannie_free_desc:0 "The French once tried to tame Brittany, training the Celtic descendants into hounds for the king's hunts. As a minority people like us, Brittany's freedom is our freedom. We have borrowed much from Brittany; now it is time to repay."

# EDG_GUY_mission_together_for_victory_title:0 "Together Toward Victory"
# EDG_GUY_mission_together_for_victory_desc:0 "Even tamed hounds shall rise in rebellion! Together with our other minority brethren, we say no to oppression and injustice!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_bow_to_arle_title:0 "§JPious and Humble§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_bow_to_arle_desc:0 "Although Arles is also a state of the Occitans, there remain some differences between the Gascon Occitans and the Languedoc Occitans—differences that the sovereign of Arles infinitely amplifies. Same faith, same people, yet the king places us second. But what can we do now? This is the price of leaving France: from one cage to another."

# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_against_north_title:0 "§JRepel the External Aggressor§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_against_north_desc:0 "Willing or not, we and Arles are now grasshoppers tied to the same string. Facing the Northern threat, Southerners must unite, temporarily setting aside our mutual conflicts and focusing our attention on the Northern front where we are most needed!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_beat_down_title:0 "§JBehead the Serpent§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_beat_down_desc:0 "When the sovereign of Arles oppresses others with the light of faith, our true enemy is revealed. Now, it is time to liberate our brethren from the claws of the ambitious!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_glorious_independence_title:0 "§JFree Independence!§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_unite_glorious_independence_desc:0 "Once again, we have broken free from the shackles. The hypocritical light of Arles no longer shines, and the Occitans have finally attained true freedom: the freedom of choice!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_use_langdoc_title:0 "Speak of Hardships in Our Mother Tongue"
# EDG_GUY_mission_use_langdoc_desc:0 "We are Occitans; Occitan is our mother tongue, not French. For centuries, Northern France has sought to annex the South. Parisian coercion and oppression have gradually eroded Occitan culture; the hegemony of French is another invisible Sword of Damocles. Facing the Northern foe, the foremost task for Occitan revival is to revive our language!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_eastern_occ_title:0 "Eastern Remnants"
# EDG_GUY_mission_eastern_occ_desc:0 "Across the Alps, in the lands of Italy, live the descendants of the Occitans. Similar to the main Occitan body, the Italian Occitans, as a minority people, have also been oppressed and enslaved by the Northern Italian states. After centuries of waiting, they are finally free."

# EDG_GUY_mission_gain_geneo_title:0 "Monopolize Liguria"
# EDG_GUY_mission_gain_geneo_desc:0 "Liguria is the trade hub of the entire Western Mediterranean. Controlling this region holds almost decisive influence over our economy. As our power gradually expands, planting the Occitan banner in Genoa is no longer impossible."

# EDG_GUY_mission_francophonie_league_title:0 "Occitan Language Alliance"
# EDG_GUY_mission_francophonie_league_desc:0 "The Occitan language not only needs revival; it must also regain vitality, rather than continuing as a complex, cumbersome, and awkward presence that slows national progress. We can precisely seize this moment of linguistic revival to learn from neighboring minority peoples and expand our minority alliance."

# EDG_GUY_mission_minorities_league_title:0 "Minority Peoples Front"
# EDG_GUY_mission_minorities_league_desc:0 "The Occitans are a minority in France. Together with the Bretons, Normans, Gallo, Picards, Franche-Comtois, Niçois, and the people of the Maritime Alps, we stand united against Parisian tyranny. If mainstream French culture cannot accommodate us, then we shall create our own mainstream culture!"

# EDG_GUY_mission_against_fra_title:0 "§JPrimary Threat§!"
# EDG_GUY_mission_against_fra_desc:0 "Poitou and Auvergne, north of Bordeaux, are our most dangerous frontline. If we cannot control these lands, the French king's spearhead will directly threaten the heartland of Occitania."
